At the same time , during the " eighth five-year plan " period , the depth of opening to the outside world was unparalleled in history .  In the past , China 's opening has recently started to the outside world gave priority to commodity trade , introduction of technology , joint investment cooperatives , but it strives to scale high levels of introducing service , introducing operation methods of modern capital , etc . and has already begun to export capital overseas and even started participating in international financial operations .

If sold to a legal person or an average people who accepts settling employees , the cost of buying seniority of state-owned employees , can be resolved by adopting the method of reducing or eliminating local taxes .  If not settling employees , the cost of buying seniority will be paid from the sale income of the state-owned net assets according to the financial affiliation relationship .  
Employees in foreign invested enterprises are dispersed across industries , the real estate public service industry , the commerce and catering service industries , the construction industry , the farming , forestry , animal husbandry , side-line production and fishery industries , and the traffic , transport , and postal industries .  In recent years , some Chinese employees have gone to work in some sporadically appearing foreign capital financial institutions .  
According to regulations by the National Foreign Exchange Management Bureau , international commercial loans indicate loans raised and borrowed by domestic institutions from financial institutions , enterprises , individual or other economic organizations abroad , and from foreign-funded financial institutions within China 's border , whose contractual repayment obligations are in foreign currency .  
The National Foreign Exchange Management Bureau clearly stipulated in the new method that , domestic institutions borrowing international commercial loans externally are only limited to : China-capital financial institutions approved by the Foreign Exchange Management Bureau to operate foreign exchange loan business ; juridical people of non-financial corporations approved by the State Department 's Authorization Department .

In Sichuan Province , the secretary of the provincial party committee and the governor have assumed full responsibility for improving the style of the party , building a clean and honest government , and fighting against corruption .  They have divided this year 's anti-corruption work into 10 major tasks and 36 specific tasks .  The organization department of the provincial party committee , the provincial planning commission , the provincial financial department and 20 other units are taking lead in fighting against corruption and implementing various measures at their own and related departments and units .  
For years in a row , China as a developing country has attracted the largest amount of foreign capital ; however , the number and scale of our transnational corporations are far smaller than those of developed countries ; at present , transnational mergers and acquisitions are concentrated mainly in the financial , insurance , telecommunications , aviation , automobile , and media fields , and our such fields have yet to be completely opened to the outside world because of their weak foundations .  
The structure of international capital has changed .  The traditional way of providing funds through banks is no longer a major financial practice .  At present , there are three different sources for obtaining funds - - direct foreign investment , bank loans , and credit market .  
Nowadays , with networks playing a growing role in the political , military , financial , communications , electric power , medical and health , and other fields , hackers ' sabotage activities are becoming increasingly rampant to pose a serious threat to economic order , social stability , and national security .  
Governors and managers at all levels within the financial sector not only are administrative leaders but also are responsible officials of the Party organization who not only need to do well their professional work but also need to stress on politics and the overall situation and consolidate ideological and political work , strengthen building contingents of cadres and workers , strengthen improving the Party �s work style and building a clean and honest government , and provide firm political guarantee for financial reform and development .  
Wen Jiabao suggested organizing all Party leading cadres to seriously study the important speech made by Comrade Jiang Zemin at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission , deeply carrying out the spirit of the plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission , working in line with the actual condition of the financial sector , setting up specific measures and taking practical actions to carry forward improving the Party �s work style and building a clean and honest government and fighting corruption within the financial sector .  
Article 1 .  These provisions are formulated in accordance with law , administrative laws and regulations , and other relevant state regulations in an effort to strictly enforce financial and economic discipline , strengthen the building of a clean and honest government , implement the " separation between revenue and expenditure " in managing administrative charges and revenues derived from fines and confiscated goods , and promote administration by law .  
( 1 ) All kinds of fees collected in accordance with law ; administrative laws and regulations ; relevant State Council regulations ; and rules and regulations jointly published by the financial and planning departments of the State Council ; as well as local laws and regulations promulgated by a province , an autonomous region , or a municipality ; rules and regulations promulgated by a provincial , regional , or municipal government ; and regulations jointly promulgated by the financial and planning ( commodity ) departments of a provincial , regional , or municipal people 's government ;  
Due to their weak foundation , serious shortages of capital and relative backward managerial skill , a large number of developing countries could not gain benefits from economic globalization , and the unequal international trade and financial management system further widened the gap between the South and the North .  
As S &amp; T have developed briskly throughout the world and economic structural adjustment has accelerated , and impacted by the Asian financial crisis , a certain international deflationary state has appeared .  This has also had a definite impact on China 's overall prices .  
So acting in the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee and the Central Economic Work Conference , stressing the central link of state-owned enterprise [ SOE ] reform , and continuing to promote all reforms such as fiscal , financial , circulation , S &amp; T , education , housing , social security , and income distribution , will be crucial to clearing the system obstacles to promoting demand and improving supply , to establish the necessary system climate .  
Xiang stated : In 1999 , the Ministry of Finance also organized forces to launch a specialized examination on how specialized funds had been managed or spent , such as funds earmarked for national bonds , funds earmarked as subsidies for key flood control projects , funds earmarked for water conservancy works , and central financial funds earmarked for helping the poor ; adopted punitive measures to deal with exposed problems in a timely fashion ; and made public through the news media a number of typical cases .  
Zhang Changli 's case of illegally soliciting deposits from the public was an economic crime that severely violated the state financial administration system and disrupted the financial order , incurring enormous losses of state , collective , and personal property .  
Financial departments have actively implemented the series of principles and policies of the party Central Committee and the State Council and completed a great amount of work in deepening financial reform , rectifying the financial order , preventing and defusing financial risks , and supporting national economic development .  This way , they have played a very important role in strengthening and improving macro-control , supporting the reform of state-owned enterprises , and safeguarding social stability .  
Foreign capital and intermediate and long-term credit banks should be supported and encouraged to take part in the development and construction of the western regions , and efforts should be made to achieve breakthroughs in investment forms and operational modes in accordance with the methods for the management of foreign financial institutions .  
Positive efforts should be made to explore ways of providing financial services in support of the scientific and technological development and their popularization in the western regions , support infrastructure construction in key state-level hi-tech development zones as well as the production and circulation of hi-tech products , accelerate the technical transformation of competitive industrial enterprises in the western regions , and properly provide credit services to scientific research institutions in accordance with regulations .  
Meanwhile , the " Opinions " has also put forward concrete views on how people 's courts can successfully provide a legal guarantee for both the readjustment of the agricultural structure and the development of the rural economy , standardize the financial order according to the law , guard against and avert financial risks , protect intellectual property rights , and provide a guarantee for a sound implementation of the strategy of carrying out a large-scale development in China 's western region .  
We laid stress on investigating and supervising the use of special funds obtained from national debt , the large amount of central subsidies for flood prevention and water conservancy projects , the extra-budgetary funds of the central finance , central funds for assisting the poor areas , and funds for social security .  We investigated and handled a number of cases of violating financial and economic law , and disciplined those who were involved in such cases .  
Xiang noted that in light of the impact of the Asian financial crisis and domestic contradictions in scant effective demand in 1998 , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council made a resolute strategic decision to implement a proactive fiscal policy ; unceasingly stepped up policy efforts to expand the scope of the fiscal policy role ;  
On the other hand , Xiang Huaicheng added , the state has attached great importance to the issues of national debt and the size of the deficit ; strengthened fiscal capacity and the study of public risks ; strictly monitored the trend of fiscal operation ; prepared the necessary measures ; paid attention to precautions against fiscal risks ; reduced unnecessary expenses ; strove to control the size of the deficit ; improved policy means ; and enhanced the guiding and stimulating role of financial capital .  
We should increase our support of expenditures in the public welfare area to ensure that science and technology , education , social security , agriculture , ecological conservation , and other key areas and fields have the necessary funds to meet their expenditure needs .  We should increase our financial support for the establishment of a disaster prevention system , for projects designed to protect natural forests and to return grain plots to forestry , for poverty relief work , and for raising the peasants ' income .  
It is necessary to seriously sum up the experiences of practice , further perfect the relevant policies on reforming the grain circulation setup , and persist in wide-open purchase of the peasants ' surplus grain at protected prices ; at the same time , we should appropriately readjust the scope and relevant policies of purchasing grain at protected prices , so as to protect the peasants ' initiative in growing grain , promote restructuring of agricultural production , and reduce the state 's financial burden .  
and eliminate backward production techniques .  Meanwhile , the industrial enterprises in the urban areas should be relocated in an orderly fashion .  With regard to the tertiary industry , we should give priority to developing tourist , financial and insurance , real estate , and cultural industries , as well as network-based information service industries .  
As technological innovation is an important guarantee for enhancing competitiveness and achieving internationalization , Chinese household electrical appliance enterprises have not relaxed in technological innovation even for a moment after making it into the international market , investing massive human , material , and financial resources in technological innovation as well as marketizing , internationalizing , and commercializing it .  
Guo Zhenqian said the Financial and Economic Committee held that the 2000 central and local government budget arrangements have implemented the requirement for continued enforcement of a positive financial policy ; realized the spirit of readjusting structure , expanding domestic demand , ensuring main areas , promoting development , and maintaining stability ;  
paid attention to suppressing and saving general expenditure while practicing an positive financial policy ; striven to control the scale of financial deficit and debt ; and decreased the central government 's financial deficit compared with previous year when calculated in terms of comparable items .  
After last year 's central budget was approved , in the light of changes in the domestic and international situations , the party central committee and State Council decided to step up implementation of a positive financial policy .  
The Finance and Economic Committee is of the opinion that the central and local budgets for 2000 are in line with the requirement of continuing to implement a positive financial policy , and manifest the spirit of adjusting the economic structure , increasing domestic demand , assuring key expenditures , boosting development , and maintaining stability .  
The motions handled since the Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee , which are rich in content , have mainly included those aimed at maintaining sustained , rapid , and healthy national economic growth ; strengthening agriculture and doing a good job in rural work ; continually and energetically pressing ahead with the state-owned enterprise reform ; guarding against and alleviating the financial crisis ; expanding domestic demand ; continually implementing the principle of opening up to the outside world and vigorously opening up the international market ;  
In light of the situation in Yunnan , indeed , only by maintaining relatively rapid economic growth under the precondition of enhancing effectiveness can the enterprises ' difficulty in production and operation be mitigated , the pressure of employment be lessened , and the structural adjustment and in-depth reformed be promoted , so that financial revenue can be increased , financial risks be prevented , and social stability be maintained .  
Finally , the person in charge stressed : The personnel of the central bank must further improve the study of laws , and make sure that they study , be aware of , and understand the laws .  Not only should they know well the financial laws and regulations , they should also study relevant economic laws and regulations , and constantly enhance their level of administration according to law , so as to provide effective guarantee for promoting the stable development of the financial industry .  
One of major policies adopted at the meeting is to , in combination with the efforts of state-owned banks to handle their bad assets with concentrated efforts , introduce the practice of changing debt to equity by means of financial assets management companies and resolve the problem of an unduly high ratio of liabilities in a number of key state enterprises which have marketable products and enjoy sound development prospects , but have nevertheless landed in difficulty because of their unduly high ratio of liabilities .  
Drawing on the successful experiences of foreign countries , China has successively set up the four financial asset management companies of Xinda , Dongfang , Changcheng , and Huarong since last year .  By far , these companies have respectively purchased , operated , and handled the bad assets of the China Construction Bank , the Bank of China , the Agricultural Bank of China , and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China . This marks the formal start of the practice of changing debt into equity in the country .  
A responsible person of an authoritative state organ pointed out the other day : If the work of changing debt into equity is successfully conducted , it can provide a healthy financial foundation for state banks and state enterprises in China and can help prepare them for meeting competitions from both domestic and overseas markets .  However , if the work of changing debt into equity turns out to be a failure , we will be unable to attain the desired goal of this policy ;  
The outlay of the National Natural Sciences Foundation , in every field of natural science , has subsidized more than 40,000 projects in the more than ten years since 1986 .  In addition , recent financial support has seen a rather large increase , which has brought important functions into play , such as raising the level of the entire system of China 's basic scientific research ; promoting China 's scientific and technological innovation ;  
Hong Kong itself has an excellent environment for business operations , as demonstrated in its world-class commercial and financial services , the complete and efficient trade supplementary services , the modern infrastructure facilities , and the perfect system of rule by law ;  
Also through structural readjustment , the western region is expected to eliminate a batch of technical the backward small enterprises which pollute the environment ; and at the same time , the region should expand and reinforce those industries and enterprises which enjoy a sound competitiveness in the market and which can increase the financial sources of the region , so that they can become a pillar and a base for the rejuvenation and the development of the local economy .  
To improve its monetary policy-related work , the committee has , since 1999 , held meetings of economic and financial experts at regular intervals .  The purpose is to widely solicit opinions about the monetary policy from the academic community , study major issues on international and domestic economic and financial policies , and acquire suggestions from all sectors of society in an effort to improve its work related to the monetary policy .  
Accession to the WTO will be a major step in our country 's economic development strategy in the 21st century .  With the inevitable enhancement of foreign exchanges , there will be more intensive exchanges and movements of human , material , information , and financial resources .  
In order to actively promote the reform of the budget management system , establish a budget management system that fits the system of the socialist market economy , and bring about a scientific , institutionalized , and standardized system of budget management , as well as enhance the efficiency of using financial fund , the Ministry of Finance has decided to launch the work of reappraising fixed assets and circulating funds in 2000 for the administrative institutions and organizations under the jurisdiction of the central budget .  
criminal activities are on the rise in financial computer systems and e-commerce systems ; the CIH virus , BO hacker procedures , and other harmful databases have been spread far and wide .  Some hackers at home and abroad illegally intruded into information systems in important areas of China , attacking websites and stealing state or commercial secrets .  
We have persisted in implementing the strategy of rejuvenating the city on the strength of science and education , conscientiously placing education in the strategic position that gives top priority to educational development , and continuously increasing the financial input into education , so that a relatively complete educational system has been formed , and the 12-year education system has been made universal in the city five years ahead of schedule prescribed by the state .  
For many years we have worked hard to put into practice Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of common prosperity .  Having gained a certain economic strength , we began to carry out the " project of common prosperity " and , relying mainly upon the financial departments at the city level for many consecutive years , raised funds totaling 1.88-billion yuan and put them into the relatively backward areas of the city in a bid to improve their infrastructure facilities , industrial layout , and cultural and educational conditions , thereby bringing about the coordinated development of various localities .  
Being flexible and adaptable to changes , rich in international financial management experiences , and just out of the Asian financial storm , the people in the Hong Kong financial sector have grown more rational and more mature .  
makes information distorted and policy decisions wrong ; causes the waste of many human , material , and financial resources and precious time ; and enables the people to lose many rare chances for development .  
To relax the control of the capital account , it is first necessary to establish a flexible and effective financial macrocontrol mechanism .  To achieve this goal , the central bank must be able to select from many operating methods for regulating interest rates and foreign exchange rates .  
According to the latest statistics made by the People 's Bank of China , in the first quarter of this year , China 's banking and financial operations were normal and stable and showed a trend of positive development .  Continual increases in money supply and total credit met the need in expanding domestic demand , promoting production and the growth of consumption , and conformed in the main to the economic development .  The deposits of enterprises increased by a great extent , loans extended by financial institutions were expedited , and foreign exchange reserves increased steadily .  
If we only reckon up dead accounts , it will be very difficult to do a good job in fiscal work , and we may stifle it to death , which will have a direct impact on the economic and political results of financial expenditure , on economic and social development , and on the expansion of sources of finance and the strengthening of the state 's finances .  
Carrying out a positive fiscal policy , strengthening infrastructure construction , supporting agricultural basic construction and construction for the ecological environment , supporting economic restructuring , speeding up the development of hi-tech industry , revamping old industrial bases and traditional industries , practicing the policy of rejuvenating the nation through science and education and the strategy of sustainable development , and establishing a social security system all require corresponding increase of input and state financial support .  
In the course of economic globalization , floating capital is mainly controlled by the financial and business magnates of Western developed countries .  While the environment issue in Western countries has increasingly become a popular concern , to reap super profits , these magnates moved their enterprises that promise high profits but cause serious pollution to developing countries , thus sparking a global ecological crisis .  
The outgoing IMF managing director , Michel Camdessus , said : We have the opportunity to avoid financial crisis and narrow the wide gap between the rich and the poor that " may possibly cause an explosion " so that economic globalization will have human nature in a greater sense .  However , the premise for so doing is that the international economic structure must be commensurate with economic globalization and economic reform plans are widely supported by the populace .  
Second , reform has led to the monetization of economy and the deepening of finance , the former distribution in kind was gradually changed to distribution in money at real market prices ( the recent reform to suspend welfare housing distribution is an example ) , and the simple and unitary financial product previously provided by commercial banks has become complex and diversified .  
We should concentrate our manpower as well as financial and material resources on building a group of high-ranking academies and universities that have clear-cut military characteristics .  We should give priority to supporting a group of academic departments and laboratories that have utmost bearing on future wars .  These academic departments and laboratories will play a role as an initiator and demonstrator for all military academies .  
The key to Taiwan 's ability to maintain a relatively stable economic situation on the island under the financial crisis since July 1997 lies in the mainland 's stable economy , firm Renminbi , and vast consumer market , which have stabilized Taiwan 's trade with and investment in the mainland and thus stabilized Taiwan 's external trade to ensure normal functioning of the island 's economy .  
Moreover , China 's financial system is still not complete , and the capital market is not yet developed .  The enormous state-owned banking system is also not yet on the international track .  It will be frustrated for a long time to come in terms of an enormous bad capital problem .  
They also pointed out : Economic globalization has impacted the industries and domestic markets of developing countries that are in a " vulnerable positions " on differing degrees , and have greatly increased the risks of economic fluctuations and of triggering a financial crisis in a country .  Economic globalization has continuously widened the gap between the rich and the poor around the globe , and the economic sovereignty and independence of many countries have been tested .  
However , frequent international financial crises remind us that if the potential risks in the international balance of payments are not eliminated and dispelled in a timely manner , as soon as a serious imbalance occurs it will not only affect the economic and financial stability of a country , it will also jeopardize the basic interests of foreign investors .  
People will not forget that in the autumn of 1997 , the special administrative region government , which had just been set up , faced the impact of the financial crisis that wrecked havoc across Asia . The prices of securities in Hong Kong , whose pillar industries were the financial business and real estate , plummeted and the prices of houses also fell drastically , causing the economy as a whole to decline .  
While people were sighing in despair , the special administration region government took drastic measures on its own initiative to strengthen the linked exchange rate system , drove international speculators out of Hong Kong , and stabilized the securities market and financial market , thus proving the pessimistic predictions of some people to be untrue .  
In 1986 , Qingdao started to openly select and appoint the deputy directors of its planning commission , economic commission and financial committee .  In 1993 , it selected deputy administrators and assistants from applicants all over the country for its five departments including the city 's science and technology commission , bureau for tourism , and high-tech industrial park .  In 1999 , it had selected and appointed six leading cadres at the deputy bureau chief level from applicants in the whole city .  
Since large enterprises are not required to exercise the function of bearing the financial burden in supporting social undertakings , the surplus personnel they released have to be digested by small and medium-sized enterprises .  Many new service sectors , such as service units in cities and towns as well as community services , have also relied on the support of small and medium-sized enterprises .  As a developing and rising group , small and medium-sized enterprises have started to show their vitality .  
The final statement and action program adopted by the first Southern Ministerial Meeting called for the establishment of a fair and rational international economic order , reform of the irrational international financial system and the unequal international trade system , and for the UN to play a leading role in the economic affairs of the world so that the developing countries would be able to participate more in global economic decisions .  
Like their civilian counterparts , the legal affairs that military lawyers have to handle involve those relevant to criminal , civil , economic , administrative , maritime , and financial laws , and so they must be totally familiar with the laws and regulations of the country so that they can properly handle the legal affairs in the armed forces and legal affairs that involve both military and civilian departments ;  
It is necessary to integrate education with management and punishment .  In view of the special feature that the financial sector has more economic crimes than any other sectors and through the establishment of three defensive lines of ideology , system , and law , the financial sector should coordinate its regular ideological education with strict management and its efforts to strictly crack crimes , so as to form an education-management-crackdown structure .  
This regiment was equipped with certain advanced anti-tank self-propelled guns and anti-tank missiles , but some battalions and companies failed to concentrate their main energies on the development and application of the property of the new equipment and the mastery of weapons in hand .  Instead , they put a lot of financial , material and human resources into learning English and microcomputer technology , and making multi-media software .  All battalions and companies of this regiment reported more than 30 science-technology military training achievements to the regiment in a year .  
The Asian financial crisis has given us a practical lesson .  Financial security is no longer a pure economic issue .  It has a bearing on the political and social security of a country and is part and parcel of national security .  
Currently we regulate and control the money supply mainly by controlling the total credit of state-owned commercial banks and we have not yet adopted indirect regulation and control means in real terms in this regard .  After China enters the WTO , changes in money supply and swings in interests in international markets will have a direct impact on China 's domestic financial market and money supply and they will make it more difficult to regulate and control money supply .  Consequently , China 's existing macroscopic financial regulation and control will face challenges .  
Moreover , our country 's financial supervisory departments have not yet indirectly controlled and regulated domestic financial supervision in real terms and established an effective supervisory system .  
In regulating the money supply , the central bank must explore ways to rationally control money supply at all levels in the new financial environment through multiple forms of indirect regulation and control , such as open market operation , deposited reserve , rediscounts , interest rates , and special deposits , and promote a timely transition from direct to indirect regulation and control .  
We must strengthen cooperation between the central bank and other financial supervisory departments , make supervision more efficient , financial supervision more effective , and the financial sector more transparent , and establish a perfect financial supervisory organization and institutional system .  
During the " 10th Five-Year Plan " , the province should remarkably increase the proportion of the non-public sector in its entire economy and should build this sector into a strong motive force to speed up economic growth and employ the jobless in society and into an unexhausted source to increase financial revenues as well as incomes of urban and rural residents .  
Just as some economists have analyzed , through the practice of proactive financial policies , China has withstood the impacts of the Asian financial crisis , achieved the sustained and relatively rapid national economic growth , created favorable conditions for promoting reform , exploiting the existing production capability , mitigating the contradiction with regard to employment , and maintaining social stability , and concentrated its energies on constructing a number of infrastructure facilities and accomplishing some major projects which were intended , but were unable , to be carried out for years .  
During the early period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , in the light of the outstanding issues in the economic life , containing inflation was regarded as the priority task of macroeconomic control and moderately tight financial and monetary policies were implemented , and measures for comprehensive control were adopted , thus reversing the situation of high inflation .  Under the circumstance of still maintaining a relatively high level of economic growth rate , the soaring prices have returned to a relatively low level , thus the national economy smoothly realizing a " soft landing . "  
Since 1997 , with reference to those issues like the Asian financial crisis , insufficient effective domestic demands , and so on , active financial policies and firm and steady monetary policies were implemented .  Through issuing national debts , expanding investments , promoting consumption , and increasing exports , the deflation development tendency has been effectively stopped .  
During the period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , the historical opportunity of expanding domestic demands and implementing active financial policies was seized .  Through issuing national debt and expanding investments , we have concentrated efforts to build a batch of major projects and fulfilled some big projects which we had always wanted to fulfill but failed .  The agricultural , forestry , and water conservancy construction has noticeably quickened .  
In the face of the new situation , new state of affairs , and new issues , we have timely readjusted those moderately tight financial policies and monetary policies into actively financial policies and steady and safe monetary policies and coordinately applied various means to regulate and control economic operations .  We have both increased investment in infrastructure construction and supported the technical renovation of enterprises .  
For the purpose of curbing deflation and expanding domestic demand , the implementation of a positive financial policy was consistently combined with the implementation of a moderate and stable monetary policy .  While efforts were made to promote economic growth , attention was also paid to keeping the smooth and stable operation of the economy .  
On this point , Xu Simin raised his voice : " First , during the crucial period when the Asian financial crisis was riding roughshod over Hong Kong , the SAR Government used its foreign exchange reserve to invest in the stock market , repelling the huge international financial speculators and preserving Hong Kong 's financial stability .  
In the provinces and cities along the eastern coast and in the prefectures and counties where secondary and tertiary industries are developed , the financial resources are fairly strong , so there should not be a problem , but in the midwestern provincial areas - - particularly the prefectures and counties which are centered around agriculture - - what will be done about the fiscal shortfalls left after change from fees to taxes in the rural areas ?  
In cases in which counties and villages ( towns ) are really hard pressed financially once fees are replaced with taxes , the financial authorities at the national and provincial levels should shift sufficient funds to ensure that this major reform goes forward smoothly .  
To ensure sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development in Tibet , the party Central Committee has adopted eight major preferential policies for the region , including fiscal , financial , investment , foreign trade , as well as agricultural , animal-husbandry , and rural policies .  
APEC should make great efforts to promote economic and technological cooperation and add new dimensions to such cooperation .  In addition , based on the lessons learned from the financial crisis , it should further enhance macroeconomic coordination among its members .  The meeting of finance ministers should serve as a major mechanism for its member economies to exchange views on the economic situation , publish important economy-guiding information , and coordinate economic-development policies .  Similarly , work should be done to make the meeting of central bank governors a mechanism for coordinating banking activities .  
Examples are building early-warning and preventive mechanisms , forming an APEC financial early-warning group ( composed of finance ministers of major economies and financial experts ) , enhancing macroeconomic coordination , establishing emergency financial assistance mechanisms , enacting APEC rules for financial activities , supervising the flow of large amounts of capital in the region , and setting up financial personnel training organizations to raise the financial operational and management ability of developing economies .  
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , Xiamen 's gross national product roseby 16.6 percent on an annual average and the city 's GNP and financial revenue also ranked the first among all special economic zones .  
and has ensured that the financial system will remain stable .  The government has also shown unreserved concern for the problem of unemployment , which was left over from history , by helping unemployed workers find jobs or tackle problems in livelihood .  The government has joined hands with social forces in introducing a variety of training activities and in opening up new employment channels and this has helped check a rising unemployment rate and ease up the unemployment situation .  
Through reforms and opening up over more than 20 years , Guangzhou has given play to many of its traditional commercial advantages and has gradually built up a mature market system , laid a good industrial foundation , built up its financial strength , and improved its investment environment and investment management .  
All Tthese reform all conform to the objective rules of the military 's economic administration under the socialist market economy , and meet the requirements of the national financial reform .  The implementation of these measures will substantially improve the scientific nature of the military spending budget administration and more fullyer allow the military spending budget-making to work as a macro-adjustment and control in our military modernization construction .  
Party committees at all levels should use Chairman Jiang 's important directives on the financial work and the decision made by the Central Military Commission to unite thinking .  They should , from the strategic perspective of the overall situation , clearly understand the great significance of the the military 's budget-making reform , understand relevant policies and regulations , hold the correct attitude towards a possible adjustment of regional interests , and implement the decision made by Chairman Jiang and the Central Military Commission in a resolute and solid manner .  
The implementation of the proactive financial policy not only has effectively controlled the total supply and demand in the immediate economy but also greatly pushed forward the adjustment of economic structure .  It has alleviated the " bottleneck " restraint of economic development , thus accumulating reserve strength for sustained and stable economic growth .  
As a result , there is a more reliable guarantee for the resource of funds to pay the interests of treasury bonds .  Particularly , with the expansion of China 's economic aggregates , the increase of the quality of economic growth , and further deepening of its financial and taxation systems , China has increasingly strengthened its financial ability to pay back its debts .  The state has an absolute ability to pay back its matured treasury bonds without causing a debt crisis .  
Dai Xianglong said : Deepening the reform of wholly state-owned commercial banks is key to the reform of China 's financial system .  In the next five years or so , China 's four commercial banks that are wholly owned by the state should be reformed into modern , large-scale commercial banks that are quite competitive in international financial markets .  
At the same time , comprehensive auditing will be conducted and strengthened in the fields of budgetary management , equipment , capital construction , reform items , and the enforcement of economic and financial discipline .  The internal auditing institutions will be improved and reinforced .  Efforts will be made to build a high-quality contingent of auditors who work honestly , diligently , and efficiently .  
The Chinese Government has also revised the " Law on Regional Autonomy of Ethnic Groups , " adopted more policies for providing necessary preferential and favored treatments in the financial , monetary , taxation , and foreign trade aspects for areas exercising regional autonomy of ethnic groups , and provided a legal guarantee for the great development of the western areas .  
In recent years the pace of development in China 's eastern region has caused people to look at it with new respect , while the Japanese economy is facing structural contradictions .  Added to these are the Asian financial crisis , the growing amount of bad assets held by banks , the sluggish progress of economic recovery , and worsening fiscal difficulties .  
We must improve the administrative structures of legal entities in state-owned commercial banks , appoint supervisory councils , establish supervisory mechanisms in accord with the market economy , set up business associations in various financial sectors , and implement prudent accounting systems in conformity with international practices .  
their internal system of rules and regulations is inadequate , their financial management is in chaos , their products are of poor quality , and their material and energy consumption is high .  They are marked by rampant tax fraud and evasion , theft and wastefulness , lack of safety measures , and reckless environmental pollution and other problems .  
Especially at a time when the country is engaged in launching the important reform projects of building a socialist market economic system and restructuring the financial and tax policies , the ministry has taken the initiative in supporting and guiding Tibet 's financial reforms in accordance with Tibet 's actual situation .  
First , with regard to assuring the requirements of monetary policy and financial supervision and control and raising the level at which duties and responsibilities are carried out according to law , the bank has established scientific , highly effective systems for financial statistics and for off-site management and control . 
Plus its inexperience in administration and its confused and ambiguous financial , economic , environmental protection , and social welfare policies , all caused the worsening of the investment environment and forced a large number of enterprises to close down or move out of Taiwan .  
In addition to the ongoing economic restructuring and the changes in the external economic environment , the worsening economic situation in Taiwan was mainly caused by the turbulent political situation , the confused financial and economic policies , the uncertainty in cross-strait relations , and the shaken confidence among the people after the new government took power .  In this sense , it can be considered as a consequence of the change in the authorities in Taiwan .  
Dai Xianglong analyzed and said that the breakout of the Asian financial crisis had not only internal factors , but also many external factors .  After the Asian financial crisis , various Asian countries intensified their in-depth structural adjustments and financial reorganization , handled bad assets , lowered the debt rates of the enterprises , directly or indirectly promoted economic recovery and growth , and basically maintained the stability of financial operation .  
tax evasion , tax fraud , foreign exchange fraud , and smuggling activities have continued despite repeated attempts to prohibit them ; the phenomena of commercial fraud and debt evasion are becoming increasingly serious ; false financial statements and other behavior that violates financial and economic discipline are quite common ;  
Since these training exercises , be they staged on a map , on a computer in a simulated manner , or with real arms and real men , often involve a large amount of financial and human resources and organizational efforts , we should study ways of fully developing their exemplary or guiding roles for our teaching and training work ;  
Dai Xianglong , governor of the People 's Bank of China who is attending the Fortune Global Forum 2001 in Hong Kong , said today that when facing the slowdown of the world economic growth , China will continue to carry out its positive financial policy and moderate and prudent monetary policy , extensively open domestic markets , continue to increase its foreign exchange reserve , and continue to maintain the stability of the Renminbi exchange rates .  
After developing into an international financial center , with its freely convertible currency , a sound legal system , an environment for fair competition , and the tariff-free advantage , Hong Kong 's free economy will attain further development . 
According to the experts attending the seminar from home and abroad while summing up the successful experience in the operation of China 's monetary policies over the past few years , there are some essential characteristics as follows : First , the principle of moderation has been adhered to , that is , the stabilization of currency value has been taken as the most important objective and the relationship between the prevention of financial risks and economic growth has been correctly handled ;  
Dai Xianglong pointed out that , after the Asian financial crisis of 1997 , the various countries of Asia learned a lesson , adopting realistic and feasible adjustment measures , intensifying their underlying readjustments and financial reorganization efforts , disposing of bad assets , lowering enterprise debt-equity ratios , and promoting economic recovery and growth , so financial operations have been basically stable .  
Dai emphasized that , faced with the current slowdown in world economic development , China 's membership in the WTO will mean that China 's economic and financial markets will be fully opened , which will benefit the further deepening of regional economic cooperation in Asia , as well as injecting new vitality into global economic and financial cooperation .  
Contradictions in various strata in Hong Kong should be resolved through mutual understanding and accommodation after consultation and discussion .  Sensational means should not be used to intensify contradictions .  Seeking development means creating conditions for " gathering talent and financial resources , " actively promoting industrial and education restructuring , and maintaining Hong Kong 's competitive edge at the advent of the era of global economic integration and knowledge-based economy .  
Through practicing macroeconomic regulation and control measures , with the focus on expansionist fiscal policy , in the past three years China has successfully withstood the blow of the Asian financial crisis and maintained the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
She hoped that all relevant ministries and state commissions make further effort , guarantee the smooth operation of the existing work mechanisms , and further strengthen cooperation among the customs , financial , monetary , taxation , and quality inspection departments , continue to implement the current supportive and encouraging policies and measures , and ensure the smooth development of the work of promoting trade with science and technology .  
Some countries that were affected by the 1997 financial crisis have learned experience and a lesson from the financial crisis , and , therefore , in recovering their economies , have placed greater importance on adopting a macroeconomic policy tailored to meet the actual situations .  The current ADB annual meeting also stressed the need to assist developing countries to carry out economic restructuring , enhance their macroeconomic regulation and control ability , and build and refine a social security system , in order to ensure relatively high economic growth in this region .  
The continuous growth of the tax revenue has contributed significantly to the increased financial strength of various levels of government , effective implementation of the proactive fiscal policy , and the sustained , fast , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Li Changchun and his party had earlier visited Mumbai , India 's western financial and commercial city , and Hyderabad , a newly emerging science and technology city in southern India . In Mumbai , Li Changchun attended a Guangdong-Indian economic and technology trade fair .  
However , the United States now tries to hold " across-the-board superiority " and guarantees its " absolute security " on the basis of the swelling hegemonic mentality supported by its unparalleled power after the end of the Cold War and the rich financial resources accumulated by the sustained economic growth in recent years .  
Over the past year , Taiwan 's stock market has fallen tremendously , foreign investment has shrunken , financial crises are lurking , a large number of businesses have gone bankrupt or moved away , and the rate of unemployment is rising steadily .  Forty percent of the people who supported A-Bian in the past say that they will not vote for him again .  
Under the tidal wave of economic globalization , in order to become a financial and service center , Hong Kong must have a vast economic hinterland , an extensive commercial network , the richest business information in Asia , and a large number of qualified personnel ready to provide services to international investors .  
Professor Yin Naiping of Taiwan National Chengchi University held : Taiwan could not control some of the factors that contributed to its current economic , financial , and banking difficulties , for example , international economic recession and burdens left behind from the past .  However , we could not deny that due to their incompetent administration , Taiwan authorities have created additional problems , inappropriately handled problems left behind from the past , and further aggravated Taiwan 's economy .  
Professor Yin Nai-ping of Taiwan 's National Chengchi University held that there are some uncontrollable factors in Taiwan 's economic , fiscal , and financial problems .  For example , the international economic recession and burdens left over by the previous government .  
The " prescriptions " written by people of insight on the island include pursuing political stability , promoting industrial upgrade , raising administrative efficiency , and promoting financial reforms .  However , they spontaneously stressed the crucial role of developing cross-strait relations .  Some scholars pointed out that the authorities ' " no haste , be patient " policy has led people to lose hope .  
There are two reasons why the United States has decided to give up its strategy of " winning two local wars breaking out simultaneously . "  First , the United States has been feeling that its military strength and transport capability are inadequate and its financial resources are insufficient , making it difficult to continue to hit others using two fists at the same time .  
The European Parliament highly values the correct position adopted by China in the Asian financial crisis a few years ago , and is glad to see that China has made great achievements in its socialist modernization and in maintaining social stability , and enabling its people to live and work happily and peacefully .  It is willing to make joint efforts with the Chinese side in strengthening cooperation in the political , economic , trade , and financial fields , and make greater efforts to advance the comprehensive development of European-Chinese relations .  
Shan Jie has also spared no effort to mobilize the local masses to collect and purchase Wulingzhi , Yizhihao , Hongjingtian , and other natural medicinal herbs which grow on the plateau , and has set up Tibet Kangda Medicines Company Ltd . as the first " joint venture enterprise on the plateau . "  As a result , the county 's annual financial revenue has risen by 6 million yuan .  
Over the past few years , in order to seek the status as a so-called " independent political entity " in the international arena , the Taiwan authorities , in the name of expanding " international living space , " have devoted massive manpower and material and financial resources to pursuing " money diplomacy . "  
In fact , since the start of the ASEM 's cooperation mechanism , member countries have conducted extensive cooperation and exchanges in many areas .  In addition to economic , trade , and financial cooperation , Asia and Europe have launched political dialogues , cultural forums , and scientific and technological cooperation .  They have also sponsored symposiums on international issues , such as economic globalization , cultural diversification , strengthening the role of the United Nations , safeguarding the equilibrium and stability of global strategy , which have become the topics of ASEM .  
Xiang Huaicheng told Chinese reporters in an exclusive interview that during their visit to Germany , China and Germany completely agreed that both countries shared an extensive consensus on many major international financial and monetary issues ; and the two countries should continue stepping up cooperation in multilateral international institutions and forums , including the IMF , the World Bank , as well as the 20-Nation Group and the Asian-European Financial Ministers ' Conference . Meanwhile , the two countries should also further expand mutual financial and economic exchanges .  
Speaking of their visit in France , Xiang Huaicheng indicated that he and French Financial Minister Laurent Fabius had held a fruitful meeting at which they discussed ways to strengthen mutual financial and monetary cooperation , and exchanged views , and reached an extensive consensus , on many issues , including the international macroeconomic situation , social security issues , and multilateral and regional cooperation .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : " The fact that China is strengthening its financial and monetary exchange and cooperation with Germany and France is not only conducive to a smooth development in the friendly relations of our two sides ; but is all the more significant to promoting coordination between advanced countries and developing countries against the background of an economic globalization , to maintaining a stable global macroeconomic situation with joint efforts , and to establishing a rational international monetary framework as well as global economic rules . "  
Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and Government leaders , including Jia Qinglin , fully reaffirmed the public security organs ' special campaigns and public order rectification work that mainly aimed to crack down on criminal underworld and evil elements , and that also aimed to severely crack down on serious violent crimes , repeated financial crimes , neighborhood crimes , and drug-related crimes .  
In the wake of the gradual deepening of China 's market-oriented reform of the foreign currency interest rates , its foreign currency interest rates are no longer shut in their own closed environment and are instead linking tracks with the international financial community ; they are following international practices and rules and regulations to increasingly move up and down in sync with the international interest rates .  The characteristics of internationalization and conformity are becoming more clear with each passing day .  
Since the beginning of the second half of 2000 , the economies of some APEC developed members have undergone major readjustments ; economic growth has remarkably slowed down ; the demand of the global information technology and electronic industry has been sluggish , and the financial market unstable ; export has begun to slow down ; and trade protectionism has raised its head .  These trends will bring about some uncertainties to APEC economic cooperation .  
Due to the continuous decline and notable shrink in the transactions of Taipei 's stock market in the previous week , the influence of the upcoming PLA military exercise on Dongshan Island , and the upcoming publication of the various industries ' business income in May , electronic shares did not perform well on 4 June , and Taipei 's stock market opened low and remained low .  Except for financial shares , which registered growth thanks to the support of specific funds , all shares declined .  
Speaking at a recent symposium on financial and economic affairs , Central Bank Vice Governor Chen Shih-meng mentioned that , at the recent International Monetary Fund meeting he attended , many foreign businessmen maintained that they believed the Chinese Mainland would become the biggest market in the future , but that , owing to political and cultural factors , they had problems gaining direct access .  
Now , financial and economic officials , while continuing to uphold the " no haste , be patient " policy , have pledged that Taiwan " will become a center , not a springboard " .  How can they expect to rebuild the people 's confidence with the slogan that they will " work desperately hard for the economy " when their basic logics for regional economy are self-contradictory ?  
However , since he took office , he has failed to honor his commitment .  To consolidate his political base , he has been blindly playing up to the interests of the conservative forces , the rich , and large enterprises , especially of the military industrial enterprises , in the financial budget and taxation policy , education policy , social security policy , environment policy , and on a series of other issues .  
The central government should strengthen across-the-board management and guidance for basic education , and should transfer more financial resources to the areas with difficulties and the areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups in the central and western parts of the country according to the actual conditions , thus supporting the development of basic education in these areas .  
Putin 's strategic target of rejuvenating Russia , restoring Russia 's prestige as a big power , and turning Russia into a major polar in today 's multipolar world tallies with the mentality and the aspirations of the Russian people ; with the addition of the remarkable results that he has already attained in boosting the country 's economic , financial , and agricultural development and in increasing the public 's income , Putin is now enjoying a strong backing at home . 
In the face of a drastic change in the world 's pattern , as well as heavy and arduous reform tasks , our party judged the hour and sized up the situation , made wise policy decisions , eliminated all kinds of interference , properly handled a series of major and complicated issues , withstood the buffet caused by the Asian financial crisis , overcame the historically unprecedented floods , and succeeded in maintaining a sustained , rapid and sound economic development .  
As a result of implementation in the past six years of this guiding principle for the work in Tibet in the new period , the whole region 's social situation has stabilized , rate of economic growth has increased remarkably , efforts in reform and opening up have gradually picked up , construction of infrastructure facilities including that of energy , transportation and communication has developed fairly fast , local financial revenues have registered a relatively greater increase , and the people 's livelihood has clearly improved .  
Some economists of China hold the view that the adverse influence of the decrease in exports on China 's economy has begun to show , but as long as we expand domestic total demand and implement the proactive financial policy and the steady currency policy , we will be able to sustain the stable growth , and there will be no need to adopt the policy of stimulating exports and the economy by appropriately devaluing renminbi .  
The Chinese Government will continue to carry out its vigorous financial policy and its steady currency policy in 2001 , and will steadily promote economic structural adjustment and its western development strategy , so the domestic economy will maintain steady and continuous growth .  
The Asian financial crisis unexpectedly broke out in 1997 and brought serious impacts to our neighboring countries and regions .  The party Central Committee judged the hour and sized up the situation and timely worked out a series of measures to regulate the macro-economy , thus ensuring the steady development of our foreign export trade and foreign capital inflows despite the unfavorable international economic environment .  
Investment by the state and financial aid from the central government are primarily used for the construction of relevant facilities in farming and animal husbandry industries , infrastructure , scientific and technological education and political power at the grass-roots levels , as well as protection and construction of the ecological environment , all with stress on solving " bottleneck " and prominent difficulties restricting the development of Tibet .  
The fifth is to establish a perfect rural market economic system and insurance system , draw up rules and regulations for the transactions of agricultural products , and promote the setting up of a pluralistic rural capital market in which agricultural policy banks , rural cooperative banks , commercial banks , and other nongovernmental financial organizations exist side by side .  
We should do so by starting with leaders in various financial institutions .  We should uphold healthy trends , develop new practices , enhance institutional initiative and creativity , and carry out to the letter , the decisions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council . We should make fresh , and greater contributions , through pushing forward a financial reform , rectifying financial order , stepping up financial supervision and control , and heightening operational efficiency , and should guard against and alleviate financial risks , and support national economic development as well .  
During the Ninth FYP , faced with the dual pressure of the Asian financial crisis and insufficient effective domestic demand , China further expanded the fields and scale of utilization of foreign investment while practicing a proactive fiscal policy and making efforts to increase domestic demand , and such utilization played an important stimulating role .  
This is a wise choice based on our national condition ; it has enabled us , when regional and world economic turbulence occur , to successfully guard against financial risks , avoid huge losses , and safeguard national economic security .  
If administrative examination and approval can be replaced with the market mechanisms , then administrative interference should be stopped .  If administrative examination and approval is indeed needed , then it must be done according to regular procedures with intermediate links being reduced and with results being made public so that the use of power can be subject to supervision and check-and-balance .  The reform of the financial system should be carried on .  
financial fraud and violations of fiscal and economic discipline are widespread ; there is fraud and deception in tendering for construction projects , and the quality of some projects is inferior ; the cultural markets are chaotic ; and major and serious safety accidents occur from time to time in production operations .  Some new characteristics have recently emerged in illegal activities , such as crimes being committed by syndicates , transregional crimes , crimes committed by collusion between outside and inside , specialized crime , and intellectualized crime .  
In earmarking billions of yuan for the improvement of the urban environment in spite of a relative shortage of overall financial resources , Guangzhou 's fundamental starting point is that , as General Secretary Jiang noted , " the continuous development of advanced productive forces and advanced culture is essentially to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the masses and to continuously realize the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people . "  
China 's healthy and steady economic growth over many years is an expression of the state 's unswerving implementation of correct economic policies , including the active fiscal policy , reform of state enterprises , reform of the financial setup , reform of grain circulation , reform of the social security system , and economic restructuring , which is listed as the focal point in work this year .  
For instance , gratifying changes have emerged in the problem of commercial banks ' bad debts , which had been regarded as a " time bomb " by many financial experts at home and abroad : The central bank has announced that the rate of bad debts of state-owned commercial banks has started to fall since the fourth quarter of last year , and on average it dropped by 2.1 percentage points during the first six months of this year .  
According to the latest statistics released by the People 's Bank of China , the country 's moderate fiscal policy has yielded desired results , and the country 's stable and healthy financial conditions during the first half of this year have proved to be strong support for both its economic restructuring and its sustained national economic growth .  
In the last few years , as China 's economy has developed rapidly , bad assets , extending loans in violation of established regulations , financial fraud , losses of state-owned assets , and other problems related to Chinese banks , insurance companies , and other financial institutions have cropped up one after another , seriously compromising healthy development of China 's financial industry and economy and becoming an economic tumor in the country .  
If a county indeed has difficulties in funding teachers ' wages due to insufficient financial resources , the problem should be solved by readjusting expenditure structure and by increasing central fiscal transfer payment to local authorities .  The increase of teachers ' income should absolutely not be done by raising the taxtbook fee and miscellaneous fee .  
According to state regulations , county-level financial departments should pay wages directly to teachers on regular payrolls .  As to the counties without sufficient financial resources and with actual difficulties in paying wages to teachers , problems in this area should be resolved through readjustment of the expenditure structure and in the way to increase transfer payments between central and local revenues .  
At the National Audit Working Forum held here today , Li Jinhua , auditor-general of the National Audit Office , said that since the " Audit Law " was promulgated six years ago , budget execution audit has played a positive role in safeguarding the financial and economic order , driving the reform of the fiscal system , reinforcing budget management , promoting administration by law , and strengthening the building of clean and honest administration .  
This meeting is a concrete embodiment of our efforts to implement the gist of both the State Council work conference on rectifying and regulating the market economic order and the national work conference on public security ; is an important move that aims to rectify the country 's financial order , as well as guard against and avert financial risks ; and is also a general modernization order and a general work plan on launching a special campaign in key areas against the manufacturing and sales of counterfeit currencies .  
put an end to the rampant manufacturing and sales of counterfeit currencies in a number of areas ; successfully checked the sudden growth in the amount of counterfeit currencies ; and has played an important part in maintaining a stable economic , financial , and social order , and in promoting the healthy growth of the socialist market economy .  
The after-effects of the financial crisis still exist in certain countries in varying degrees , resulting in political turmoil and conspicuous ethnic , religious , and other social contradictions , seriously affecting the confidence of domestic and foreign investors .  
In order to further improve the global development environment , the developing and the developed countries should continue to promote reforms in the international financial setup , launch a new round of WTO trade negotiations , narrow the development gap between the developing and the developed countries , and work together to build a more fair and rational new international economic order .  
We upheld the comprehensive management of earth resources , and the comprehensive development of agriculture , forestry , animal husbandry and semi-aquatics .  In regard to inputs of manpower , financial power , material resources , and science and technology , we realized the integrated raising of agricultural economic efficiency , ecological efficiency , and social efficiency .  
Through intensified reform and system innovation , we should continuously make administrative affairs more transparent , improve management and supervision of personnel , financial , and material resources , and improve the work mechanism that opposes corruption and advocates honesty , so that economic crimes and corrupt phenomena can be timely discovered , effectively prevented , and strictly punished .  
The old international economic order was a product of the imperialist colonial age , including an international production system with irrational international division of labor as its basis , a capitalist international trade system with the exchange of unequal value as its basis , and a capitalist monetary and financial system with monopoly as its basis .  
At meetings in Beidaihe , the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee specifically discussed problems China would face after joining the WTO . The Political Bureau has decided to set up a WTO-accession financial and fiscal work leading group .  Led by Wen Jiabao , vice premier of the State Council , the leading group will call a national financial and fiscal work meeting in November . The objective of the leading group is to " revamp financial order , perfect the exchange-rate mechanism , regulate the capital market , and improve personnel proficiency . "  
It was learned that the leading group led by Wen Jiabao is drafting a report on China 's financial and fiscal structure after the WTO accession .  The report will give a comprehensive assessment of China 's financial and fiscal situations in terms of legal system , organization , operation , and personnel , and propose countermeasures for a series of problems China will face after its entry to the WTO , such as capital drain , unhealthy competition in the credit market , and risks arising from international speculative activities in the stock market .  
The Chinese Government will set up special organizations in the newly established financial supervision bureau of the People 's Bank of China and in the new regulatory bureau of the Securities Regulatory Commission , in order to regulate investments by foreign funds and the flow of such funds on the mainland , thereby preventing financial turmoil caused by huge fluctuations in the flow of international investment funds .  
China is now in a period of economic structural transformation , during which the rules governing the planned economy are being smashed while the rules governing the socialist market economy remain imperfect .  Under such circumstances , financial loopholes , violations of the financial law and discipline , and government corruption are inevitable .  
As for topic on banking , it will include the positioning of policy-related banks , the consolidation of rural credit cooperatives , how to digest bad debts by asset management companies , market-oriented interest rates , foreign exchange control , further resolving contradictions in the current financial operation , and continuing to solve problems which remain unsolved .  
Despite China 's rather strict control over the media industry and the many obstacles foreign capital is bound to encounter in accession , covetous foreign financial groups , started from the periphery , have already sought ways to establish ties with the media inside China through various channel and gradually infiltrated into this fertile land of media industry .  
Following the continuous implementation of the proactive fiscal policy in depth , China had witnessed a major turnaround in economic development in 2000 .  The annual GDP grew 8 percent in 2000 .  The state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises had notably improved their economic performances .  China had basically achieved its goal to lift difficult enterprises out of their economic trouble .  Its exports increased by 28 percent and fiscal revenues reached 1.338-trillion yuan , a growth of 193.6-billion yuan over that in 1999 .  Its financial operation remained stable .  
Governments at all levels should show deep care for the people , always care about the well-being of the working masses living in difficult conditions , fully rely on the masses , rely on the community management organizations , do careful and meticulous work , find out the concrete conditions of the people living in difficult conditions , effectively arrange the necessary funds needed by the issuance of minimum livelihood allowances through adjusting the structure of financial revenue and expenditure .  
During the current visit , the NAV delegation has specially studied China 's construction of the Three Gorges Project and held discussions and exchanged views with the NPC financial and economic committee , the State Council 's Three Gorges Project Construction Committee , the Ministry of Water Resources and the Power Corporation . We are willing to carry out active exchanges and cooperation with our Vietnamese comrades in economic construction and to further and constantly enhance the traditional friendship between the two peoples .  
China 's economic strength , particularly the foreign economic balancing ability , has been substantially enhanced in the 20 years of development , so that China is capable of accepting such a challenge as opening its financial sector to the outside world , and is powerful enough to maintain a stable currency value .  
At a briefing to Chinese and foreign reporters today , Liu Hong , director of the State Statistics Bureau , said : In 1999 , China 's economy grew steadily ; the residents ' living standards continued to improve ; the financial , securities , and insurance industries were continuously standardized and developed ; social undertakings made new advances ; and environmental protection was further strengthened .  
In relevant reports , it also will be announced that a positive financial policy will be implemented this year - - the third consecutive year .  By issuing treasury bonds , the state will make financial investments to increase domestic demand and ensure economic growth .  
On its economic and social fronts , China successfully met its preset targets for economic growth , its exports ceased to fall and began to pick up , its financial revenue enjoyed a stable growth , an increase was registered in the economic returns of state enterprises , and the living standards of the people are undergoing a continued improvement .  All these were remarkable work results that had attracted people 's attention .  
On the major legislative activities at present , Zeng Jianhui said : We are mainly studying in earnest the revision of the Company Law , pushing forward the drafting of the Social Security Law , strengthening legislation in the areas of science and education , drawing up and revising laws pertaining to the financial services industry and international economic relations and trade , and paying close attention to drafting the Supervision Law .  
Banking , financial and taxation , customs , scientific research , educational , and cultural and public health departments and all government organizations should use electronic and information technologies and communications networks to set up and improve high-efficiency , reliable , applicable management and social service information systems .  
The numerous opinions put forward in June 1999 , when the NPC Standing Committee deliberated over the final central financial account and the central financial audit report for 1998 , were the reasons why the reform was started officially .  However , according to people who have inside information , the MOF already planned on reforming the budgetary system early on , but did not get down to it .  
In reality , the increase of deficit this year is not the result of implementing a proactive financial policy , but is due to the change in the compilation of budget .  In the past , interests for national debts were not listed in the current central budget , but are listed in the central budget now and reflected in expenditures for this year .  On the surface , even though it appears to be a sharp increase in the deficit , it does not mean that China 's fiscal deficit is not aggravated .  
It is fair to say that the government 's economic management evolved from the manipulative style of the planned economic era to the guidance style of the reform era , but the its way of managing the economy must still progress to the regulation and control mode of the developed economy .  It should regulate the economy by promulgating economic policies , by means of market regulations , and by utilizing financial levers .  But this is premised first and foremost upon the banks becoming bona fide market barometers .  
We should realize that more than half of China 's 20 [ as published ] or so counties are in financial dire straits and are economically backward .  If the county towns ' economies make some progress , there will be hope for radical improvement in the Chinese economy .  Therefore in the new round of economic development , we should put our energy into developing the county towns .  
As for the " financial or debt " question , it is a concept based on years of the accumulative total and theoretical reckoning .  The debts that can really be directly incorporated into the finance or be shared by the fiscal finance are very limited .  
The theme of the fiscal budget is " scaling new heights , " which is exactly an ardent aspiration shared by some 7 million Hong Kong residents .  After enduring the financial storm over the past two years , quite a few residents have sustained such blows as salary cuts or lay-offs .  However , they have carried forward the spirit of working hard despite hardships and accepted the challenge from a new century marked by knowledge economy .  
Meanwhile , last year the Central Military Commission strictly prohibited the army and armed police forces from engaging in business or running enterprises and the income from their business operations which was used as welfare subsidies was thus cut .  Therefore , it was necessary for central financial authorities to compensate this lost portion of financial resources for them .  
Meanwhile , China has increased its foreign exchange reserves , successfully maintained the value of the Renminbi , and tightened its control over the capital market and the foreign exchange market .  As a result , China has attained desired results in resisting the adverse impacts of the Asian financial turmoil , and also in its bid to join the WTO this year .  
In the developing countries , the rise of commodity prices as a result of the growing financial deficits is mainly attributed to the lack of material reserves .  In the mainland , the commodity prices are falling now , and the situation is different from that in other developing countries , because it has sufficient material reserves , which will not give rise to a new round of inflation .  There is not any sign of a new round of inflation in the mainland at present .  
To eliminate the impact of the financial crisis and to quickly revive the economy , the East Asian countries have adopted some feasible methods , mainly including countermeasures against the crisis , in line with actual national conditions ; implemented expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate consumption ; increased exports to promote economic recovery ; paid attention to resolving the major social contradictions affecting their political situations ; and accelerated economic restructuring and reform .  
All East Asian countries paid attention to drawing lessons from the financial crisis and intensified financial reform .  On the one hand , the financial order was straightened out .  Some ailing banks were forced to close down , merge with others , and accept others ' management , so that the bad credit of banks was resolutely resolved .  
Some people generally maintained that the economic structural problems were deep-rooted reasons causing the Asian financial crisis .  To revive the economy , the East Asia countries should exert efforts to readjust the enterprise systems and the industrial structures , attach importance to long-term goals , focus on enhancing international competitiveness , and enhance their national productivity and technological levels through the restructuring of their industries .  
In the latter half of the nineties , after the new constitution was endorsed in a referendum , Russia set up a presidential system and a republican regime , and Yeltsin was elected president .  However , his ties with the number one political party , Communist Party of the Russian Federation [ CPRF ] , worsened .  Russia 's economic development was hindered and hit by several financial crises .  
There will be great developments in the methods of payment of personal checks and credit cards when the real-name savings system is implemented .  The central bank will greatly reduce the amount of printed money , and all financial organs and businesses will greatly cut the manpower and material resources needed to count and take care of their cash .  Consequently , the costs for monetary circulation will be greatly reduced .  
Tung Chee-hwa said : Although we ran into some difficulties - - particularly the financial storm that swept across Asia - - after our reversion , the HKSAR government has taken resolute , daring , and effective measures in conjunction with the firm and persistent fighting spirit of the masses of residents to enable the HKSAR 's financial market to enjoy steady development and the entire economy to gradually move out of the trough and get back to the broad way of prosperity . 
Since the second half of last year , China has pursued a proactive financial policy , thus enabling the economy to maintain a sustained growth .  The GDP in the first quarter of the year was expected to grow 7 percent or higher and the domestic market situation to take a favorable turn .  
China 's economic strength , particularly the foreign economic balancing ability , has been substantially enhanced in the 20 years of development , so that China is capable of accepting such a challenge as opening its financial sector to the outside world , and is powerful enough to maintain a stable currency value .  
At a briefing to Chinese and foreign reporters today , Liu Hong , director of the State Statistics Bureau , said : In 1999 , China 's economy grew steadily ; the residents ' living standards continued to improve ; the financial , securities , and insurance industries were continuously standardized and developed ; social undertakings made new advances ; and environmental protection was further strengthened .  
In relevant reports , it also will be announced that a positive financial policy will be implemented this year - - the third consecutive year .  By issuing treasury bonds , the state will make financial investments to increase domestic demand and ensure economic growth .  
On its economic and social fronts , China successfully met its preset targets for economic growth , its exports ceased to fall and began to pick up , its financial revenue enjoyed a stable growth , an increase was registered in the economic returns of state enterprises , and the living standards of the people are undergoing a continued improvement .  All these were remarkable work results that had attracted people 's attention .  
On the major legislative activities at present , Zeng Jianhui said : We are mainly studying in earnest the revision of the Company Law , pushing forward the drafting of the Social Security Law , strengthening legislation in the areas of science and education , drawing up and revising laws pertaining to the financial services industry and international economic relations and trade , and paying close attention to drafting the Supervision Law .  
Banking , financial and taxation , customs , scientific research , educational , and cultural and public health departments and all government organizations should use electronic and information technologies and communications networks to set up and improve high-efficiency , reliable , applicable management and social service information systems .  
The numerous opinions put forward in June 1999 , when the NPC Standing Committee deliberated over the final central financial account and the central financial audit report for 1998 , were the reasons why the reform was started officially .  However , according to people who have inside information , the MOF already planned on reforming the budgetary system early on , but did not get down to it .  
In reality , the increase of deficit this year is not the result of implementing a proactive financial policy , but is due to the change in the compilation of budget .  In the past , interests for national debts were not listed in the current central budget , but are listed in the central budget now and reflected in expenditures for this year .  On the surface , even though it appears to be a sharp increase in the deficit , it does not mean that China 's fiscal deficit is not aggravated .  
It is fair to say that the government 's economic management evolved from the manipulative style of the planned economic era to the guidance style of the reform era , but the its way of managing the economy must still progress to the regulation and control mode of the developed economy .  It should regulate the economy by promulgating economic policies , by means of market regulations , and by utilizing financial levers .  But this is premised first and foremost upon the banks becoming bona fide market barometers .  
We should realize that more than half of China 's 20 [ as published ] or so counties are in financial dire straits and are economically backward .  If the county towns ' economies make some progress , there will be hope for radical improvement in the Chinese economy .  Therefore in the new round of economic development , we should put our energy into developing the county towns .  
As for the " financial or debt " question , it is a concept based on years of the accumulative total and theoretical reckoning .  The debts that can really be directly incorporated into the finance or be shared by the fiscal finance are very limited .  
The theme of the fiscal budget is " scaling new heights , " which is exactly an ardent aspiration shared by some 7 million Hong Kong residents .  After enduring the financial storm over the past two years , quite a few residents have sustained such blows as salary cuts or lay-offs .  However , they have carried forward the spirit of working hard despite hardships and accepted the challenge from a new century marked by knowledge economy .  
Meanwhile , last year the Central Military Commission strictly prohibited the army and armed police forces from engaging in business or running enterprises and the income from their business operations which was used as welfare subsidies was thus cut .  Therefore , it was necessary for central financial authorities to compensate this lost portion of financial resources for them .  
Meanwhile , China has increased its foreign exchange reserves , successfully maintained the value of the Renminbi , and tightened its control over the capital market and the foreign exchange market .  As a result , China has attained desired results in resisting the adverse impacts of the Asian financial turmoil , and also in its bid to join the WTO this year .  
In the developing countries , the rise of commodity prices as a result of the growing financial deficits is mainly attributed to the lack of material reserves .  In the mainland , the commodity prices are falling now , and the situation is different from that in other developing countries , because it has sufficient material reserves , which will not give rise to a new round of inflation .  There is not any sign of a new round of inflation in the mainland at present .  
To eliminate the impact of the financial crisis and to quickly revive the economy , the East Asian countries have adopted some feasible methods , mainly including countermeasures against the crisis , in line with actual national conditions ; implemented expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate consumption ; increased exports to promote economic recovery ; paid attention to resolving the major social contradictions affecting their political situations ; and accelerated economic restructuring and reform .  
All East Asian countries paid attention to drawing lessons from the financial crisis and intensified financial reform .  On the one hand , the financial order was straightened out .  Some ailing banks were forced to close down , merge with others , and accept others ' management , so that the bad credit of banks was resolutely resolved .  
Some people generally maintained that the economic structural problems were deep-rooted reasons causing the Asian financial crisis .  To revive the economy , the East Asia countries should exert efforts to readjust the enterprise systems and the industrial structures , attach importance to long-term goals , focus on enhancing international competitiveness , and enhance their national productivity and technological levels through the restructuring of their industries .  
In the latter half of the nineties , after the new constitution was endorsed in a referendum , Russia set up a presidential system and a republican regime , and Yeltsin was elected president .  However , his ties with the number one political party , Communist Party of the Russian Federation [ CPRF ] , worsened .  Russia 's economic development was hindered and hit by several financial crises .  
There will be great developments in the methods of payment of personal checks and credit cards when the real-name savings system is implemented .  The central bank will greatly reduce the amount of printed money , and all financial organs and businesses will greatly cut the manpower and material resources needed to count and take care of their cash .  Consequently , the costs for monetary circulation will be greatly reduced .  
Tung Chee-hwa said : Although we ran into some difficulties - - particularly the financial storm that swept across Asia - - after our reversion , the HKSAR government has taken resolute , daring , and effective measures in conjunction with the firm and persistent fighting spirit of the masses of residents to enable the HKSAR 's financial market to enjoy steady development and the entire economy to gradually move out of the trough and get back to the broad way of prosperity . 
Since the second half of last year , China has pursued a proactive financial policy , thus enabling the economy to maintain a sustained growth .  The GDP in the first quarter of the year was expected to grow 7 percent or higher and the domestic market situation to take a favorable turn .  
Over the last 20 years , cross-strait trade volume has grown from less than $ 100 million in 1979 to $ 20.5 billion in 1998 , a 265-fold increase or an annual increase of 36.1 percent on average .  During the period of general economic depression in the West and the successive financial crisis in Southeast Asia and East Asia , Taiwan 's economy maintained a growth rate of around 6 percent .  It benefited mainly from trade with the mainland .  
To cope with the deflationary trend , we should change the previous prudent and conservative attitude toward the monetary policy , positively coordinate it with the financial policy , and follow up the policies closely to form the dual pushing forces for economic growth through the practice of a positive financial policy and moderate monetary policy .  
Personalities in foreign countries universally think that the Chinese policy to refrain from Renminbi 's devaluation in recent years has played a positive role in stabilizing the financial markets in Asia . As the principal decisionmaking department responsible for the exchange rate policies , the SAFE had a very good grasp of the policies , and its role is elevated accordingly .  
The meeting pointed out that in order to ensure the implementation of the policy of purchasing peasants ' surplus grain without restriction , the State Council decided to increase the scale of grain risk funds by 8 billion yuan this year , which is to be shared by the central and local financial authorities according to the current proportion they are responsible for ;  
At present , Taiwan 's military expenses exceed $ 10 billion per year .  As long as the hostilities between the two sides of the strait are terminated , Taiwan will be able to save a huge amount of military expenditure and shift the financial resources to social welfare and other fields which need the resources more urgently .  This will obviously be beneficial to the people of Taiwan .  
China 's banking industry should accelerate its pace of transforming operational mechanisms , bring about banking system upgrading , open up new business spheres , elevate its managerial level in a comprehensive way , open the financial sector wider to the outside world , maintain the state 's financial security , and facilitate the strategic adjustment of the national economic structure and the change of economic growth pattern .  
In addition , the amounts of these social security funds should be higher than the previous year .  Except for paying expenditures as required by law , the financial surplus should be mainly used for increasing social security funds .  All localities should carry out a comprehensive and careful examination of this year 's collection of various social security funds as well as social security funds for expenditures in local budgets at all levels .  
The May financial data report issued on 12 June by the People 's Bank of China [ PBOC ] shows that for the first five months of 2000 , China 's financial operations have been stable , with bank loans increasing faster , the investment orientation being rational , the renminbi [ RMB ] exchange rate in a sustained appreciation trend , and enterprise deposits up markedly , showing that enterprise economic efficiency is growing steadily better , and economic prospects are continuing to rebound .  
Since the financial crisis in Asia , China 's economy has experienced severe and complicated tests , but it has still maintained a relatively rapid growth .  In particular , since the beginning of this year , an important turning point has emerged : Economic growth has accelerated , economic results have been considerably improved , the growth in foreign trade has been vigorous , urban and rural consumption has been stable and tended to increase , financial revenue has increased by a big margin , and foreign exchange reserve has continued to increase .  
However , the industrial and commercial circle of Taiwan could not therefore set their minds at rest .  In their thinking , it is absolutely not a simple thing that Ch'en Shih-meng , an official for the " quasi-cabinet " and a long-term advisor to Chen Shui-bian [ Chen Shuibian ] in financial and economic issues , posed the idea of collecting " national security tax " twice in one month , the period from May to early June . The hidden motive and the attempt to sound out the response can not be ignored .  
Now , under the financial support of the central government , the Tibet autonomous region has experienced economic development unimaginable previously and the living standard of the people has been greatly raised .  
However , financial globalization will also separate the flow of international capital more and more from the operation of physical economy , lead to disorderly large-scale capital flow , hold the risks of financial crisis , and make some economic entities partially lose their independent economic policymaking power and their ability to the macro economy .  
In international competition , he stated , the developing nations are subject to restrictions in their domestic systems , policies , and knowledge .  As a result , they are in an unequal status in the course of international competition and are usually fragile in the face of international financial market risks .  
Observers have noted that the eight fields he mentioned would be open to the outside world step by step .  One of the fields included financial services , a field that was strictly restricted to foreign investors in the past .  This indicated the firm stand of the Chinese Government in abiding by relevant international rules and in implementing its commitments .  
The government 's investment in the development of science and technology is limited by its financial resources , and it can not attend to each and every aspect of the development of science and technology but should be responsible mainly for organizing , administering , and funding basic research and make necessary coordination and providing necessary funds for projects to tackle key difficult problems in advanced technology ; as for the general development and application of science and technology , they should be left to enterprises .  
In Chapter 2 of its " Prospects for the 2000 Global Economy , " the World Bank included the following passage : " We believed before that globalization would be conducive to economic growth in developing countries , but financial crises show that globalization has exposed the increasing instability of developing countries as they are integrated with the international financial and commodity markets and that it is more so in developing countries with a relatively big degree of being open to the movement of foreign capital .  
Viewing from international experiences and lessons , there should be at least two prerequisites for opening the financial industry of a country : First , the external environment is stable and safe , and the financial industry will not be subject to frequent and tremendous impacts after it is opened to the outside world ;  
Zhu Rongji summed up the state of the Chinese economy as follows : Since the Asian financial crisis , while the Chinese economy has sustained a severe and complex test , it has still kept quite a fast growth momentum , particularly in 2000 , when it has made a crucial turnaround .  Our economy is growing fast , with its efficiency markedly improved , foreign trade growth being strong , consumption tending to be brisk in the midst of stability , revenue up sharply , and foreign exchange reserves continuing to increase .  
Last year , international investors were not enthusiastic in making investments in Asia because of the influence of the Asian financial crisis .  Total amount of foreign capital imported by China also dropped .  However , the EU 's actual investment in China still reached $ 4.47 billion , an increase of 4 percent over 1998 .  
Since early this year , in view of insufficient demand for essential goods , lagging in structural adjustment , and other deep-rooted problems , China has continued to embraced a positive financial policy ; at the same time , it has implemented a comprehensive western region development strategy and quickened the pace of entering the WTO , bringing about crucial favorable turns in the investment , export , consumption , and other fields .  
Therefore , for a period ahead , China , while continuing to implement a positive financial policy , will step up structural adjustment and efforts to rejuvenate the country by promoting science and education , and broaden the scope of opening up to the outside world , in order to fit itself into the world 's new situation of scientific and technological progress and economic globalization .  
Due to the facts that the trend of an economic globalization has come with a swift and violent momentum and that many things still remain undone which should have been accomplished under the rule of the British Hong Kong authorities , and with the addition that the Asian financial turmoil has exploded the economic bubbles that were formed during the rule of the British Hong Kong authorities and has also exposed the problems and long-standing defects in many fields , the reform tasks facing the SAR government have proved extremely difficult and arduous .  
As an international financial , trade , and commercial center , the Hong Kong SAR has also covered a rough and rugged path in its economic development .  
All levels of finance departments ' funds and expenditure for supporting teenage students ' extracurricular activities and maintaining such venues can be arranged through that extra 1 percent local financial appropriation for educational funds .  
The two sides will , in accordance with the laws of respective countries and bilateral agreements , encourage and protect mutual investment , strengthen the exchanges and cooperation between relevant departments of the two countries , create favorable economic , financial and legal conditions , as well as other conditions , for cooperation between major trade and economic bodies of the two countries , and provide them with necessary support .  
Our total central financial expenditure reached 0.823894 trillion yuan , namely , 107.2 percent of the revised budgetary figure , outstripping the revised budgetary figure by 54.995 billion yuan , or up by 27.8 percent compared with the previous year .  
Speaking of the central financial expenditure in 1999 in terms of both allocation and use , Xiang stated : Our central financial expenditure has conscientiously implemented and carried out both the strategic arrangements laid down by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and the decision made by the Second Session of the Ninth NPC and has played a positive role in promoting sustained , rapid , or healthy national economic development ; in pressing ahead with a deep-going reform in the state-owned enterprises ; in attaining the goal of shaking off poverty ;  
have intensified our financial support for social security system building ; have continually increased our input in agricultural , forestry , water conservancy , as well as ecological or environmental protection projects ; have comprehensively implemented the CPC Central Committee 's decision on banning the army , the armed police , or the political and legal affairs organs from engaging in commercial activities ;  
Xiang Huaicheng said : China made major achievements in various national economic and social undertakings in 1999 .  The final accounts of central and local governments were rather good , with central financial revenue continuing to maintain a fine growth momentum .  
Guo Zhenqian said : The Auditing Administration conducted the audit and did a tremendous amount work on the execution of the 1999 central budget and other fiscal income and expenditure as well as the management and utilization of the 1998 state bonds special funds , thereby playing an active supervisory role in safeguarding the state financial and economic order .  
The results of the auditing show that in general the tasks in executing the 1999 central budget and managing and utilizing the state bonds special funds have been carried out well .  However , malpractices and unlawful and criminal activities are grave in the current financial and economic sphere , and some existing problems in the central budget management should not be ignored .  
On its part , by the year 2010 , Shanghai will basically have become a modern international metropolitan in terms of its economic strength , municipal layout , market structure , social development , and the degree of civilization as a big city ; and will have become an international economic , financial , and trade center .  
After joining the WTO and gradually opening up its domestic financial markets , what China will be faced with will be a direct confrontation between the strength of the international and domestic markets , and the primary responsibility of the State Administration of Exchange Control will be to read market signals and rely on modern financial programs and methods to dispel and crack down on various speculative activities promptly , upholding orderly and legitimate market competition and safeguarding the economic and financial security of the state .  
With regard to building a rapid reaction mechanism for the market , we should make efforts to counter speculation in the foreign exchange realm our starting point , because once we join the WTO , the foreign currency management departments will of course have to employ after-the-fact inspections to uncover illegal activity in the foreign exchange realm and crack down on it sharply , but the more important thing will be the direct and preemptive disruption of speculative offensive behavior targeting China 's financial markets .  
In the first half of this year , China 's GDP grew at the rate of 8.2 percent , the financial sector operated steadily , and enterprises continued to increase their economic results , which have created favorable conditions for achieving the targets of the entire year 's national economic and foreign trade development .  
Governor of People 's Bank of China [ PBOC ] Dan Xianglong today [ 19 July ] said at a press conference sponsored by the Information Office of the State Council for Chinese and foreign reporters that , during the first half of this year , the PBOC further developed the role of monetary policy , strengthened financial support to economic growth , unveiled a number of management methods and policies , maintained a steady increase of money supply , and significantly promoted a recovery of the national economic growth .  
Following the international custom , the PBOC branches organized more than 50,000 man-trips to inspect the quality of assets and genuine profit and loss of more than 38,000 financial institutions ( including branch offices ) in order to promote the improvement of internal management of commercial banks .  
Seen from the experiences of other countries in the world , to liberalize capital account management , it is generally necessary to have a stable macroeconomic environment , a sound financial system , effective supervisory capability , and immense , comprehensive national strength .  Presently China does not have all such conditions , and therefore it is still necessary to maintain capital account management .  
In view of this situation , the central authorities resolutely worked out major policy decisions to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control , and started with consolidating the financial and economic order .  To meet the demand of the new situation of building a socialist market economy system and of reform and opening up , they mainly adopted economic and legal means supplemented by essential administrative measures and adopted the " soft landing " method to deal with the overheated economy and inflation .  
To deal with the buffet brought by Asian financial crisis , China has shifted its attention from macroeconomic regulation and control to expansion of domestic demands since 1998 , implemented the proactive financial policy , striven to give play to the role of monetary policy , and comprehensively applied such economic levers as finance , banking , taxation , price , and income distribution to promote investment , consumption and export demands and bring along economic growth .  
Currently , we must seize the development opportunity , make the best of the situation to advance , uphold the principle of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement the proactive financial policy , correctly handle the relations of reform , development , and stability , guarantee a sustained , rapid and sound economic development , and greet the new century with outstanding achievements .  
Apart from that , there was a marked increase in loans for projects in the increased loans of financial institutions in the first half of the year , and these loans supported key state infrastructure construction and the technical revamping of key sectors , and promoted economic restructuring .  
As far as the work of financial departments is concerned , this means the necessity of developing good vocational ethics , establishing the spirit of loving one 's work and the spirit of selfless dedication , establishing the spirit of scrupulously abiding by one 's duty and daring to undertake responsibility , establishing the spirit of doing arduous work , being honest , and exercising self-discipline , and establishing the spirit of handling affairs according to rules and regulations and observing laws and discipline .  
We have further standardized the operational behaviors of the financial companies and have enhanced supervision or management of the financial companies to ensure their healthy development .  Apart from laying down explicit regulations for supporting their healthy development , the newly promulgated " Management Measures " has also introduced some new regulations aimed at enhancing supervision or management or at guarding against risks in light of our experiences or lessons in supervision and management over the past few years .  
Moreover , we have also standardized or systematized the measures adopted by the supervision and management organs in the past in managing the financial companies and have laid down requirements for supervising or managing the financial companies in a unified way in their business relating to both domestic and foreign capital , both domestic and foreign currencies , as well as their business stated on or not on tables .  
Additionally , the new " procedures " have standardized and systemized the measures the supervisory and management organs adopted to manage financial companies and have realized the unified supervision and management of the domestic and foreign capital , the domestic and foreign currencies , and the scheduled and unscheduled operations of financial companies .  
Shortly after Hong Kong completed the historic turn of being recovered by the motherland , it encountered the fierce impact of the Asian financial storm .  At the critical moment , when Hong Kong was being attacked from all sides by international speculators , the central government resolutely indicated that it would support , at all costs , keeping the Hong Kong currency 's exchange rate linked to the US dollar .  This greatly bolstered the SAR Government 's determination to safeguard the Hong Kong people 's wealth .  
To deal with such conspicuous problems as insufficient domestic demand , intensified export competition , greater unemployment pressure , irrational economic structure , and slow increase in peasants ' income , as well as the challenge of the Southeast Asian financial crisis , the Chinese government has adopted a correct policy of increasing government investment to boost domestic demand and promote economic growth .  
Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng recently spoke at a national meeting on financial work held in Beijing . He said : China will make active efforts to properly carry out tax reform in various aspects in accordance with the principle of reducing burdens , improving the taxation system , and standardizing distribution .  He said : China will establish a set of system concerning public financial revenue as well as tax collection and management .  This system will be sound in organization , standardized in distribution , scientific in collection and management , and stable in development .  
He expressed his satisfaction over the concrete cooperation among East Asian countries in the financial field .  He suggested that the emphasis of the cooperation among the 10 ASEAN countries and China , Japan and the ROK should be put on the financial , economic , and scientific and technological fields , and that an expert group for scientific and technological cooperation be set up within the 10-plus-three framework to explore the specific areas and modes of cooperation .  
Those who apply for judicial aid because they face financial harships or those who seek funds for basic living expenses should provide proof that the economic conditions of their own and their families are in conformity with the local government relevant departments ' stipulated standards for citizens ' economic difficulties .  
Since the Asian financial crisis broke out in 1997 , in light of changes in the macroeconomic situation , by judging the hour and sizing up the situation , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council firmly came up with such a major policy decision as expanding the domestic demand and implementing a positive financial policy .  Expanding the domestic demand and implementing a positive financial policy have since played a crucial and key role in sustaining stable economic growth ;  
pushing forward economic structural readjustment ; improving people 's forecast ; and slowing down a deflationary tendency with the result that we have withstood the repercussions of the Asian financial crisis and maintained steady economic and social development , and for which , we have been highly appraised by the world opinion at large .  
This year , our country 's economic operation has picked up with a strong momentum , for our major economic indices , such as investment , export , and so on , have risen quickly ; our consumption temperature has gone up ; and our macroeconomic situation has witnessed a continued turn for the better , which has further attested to the results of expanding the domestic demand and implementing a positive financial policy . 
Li Lanqing finally stressed : We should continue to work hard and ensure that all this year 's budgetary tasks will be fulfilled .  In the first half of this year , our country 's macroeconomic situation witnessed a significant turn for the better and our financial revenue tended to rise rapidly , and this has laid a sound basis for us to fulfill this year 's tasks .  
In past years , the party central leadership and the State Council adopted a series of policies and measures for promoting economic growth .  In particularly , a positive financial policy was pursued for three consecutive years , and it played an extremely important role in pulling up the domestic demand , and thus creating a favorable market condition for freeing state-owned enterprises from difficulties .  
In keeping with the operational state of the national economy , China 's financial expenditures and outlays maintained fairly rapid growth during the first half of the year , with fiscal revenues coming to 624 billion yuan , an increase of 94.6 billion yuan ( or 17.9% ) over the same period last year , while nationwide fiscal outlays came to 583.8 billion yuan , an increase of 119.0 billion yuan ( or 25.6% ) over the same period the previous year . 
The central financial authorities will also select some government bond key projects in the near future to implement a pilot project in centralized treasury disbursements , no longer disbursing funds by going through the departments in charge at every level , thus reducing the disbursement links , reducing the transit time of the funds , keeping funds from lying idle , and preventing the misappropriation or diversion of funds .  
contribute to help maintaining world peace and promoting common development ; and while stressing political dialogue , enhance bilateral exchanges and cooperation in economic , trade , financial , scientific , technological , cultural , and educational areas , so that the dialogue mechanism becomes a major channel in pushing forward mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Latin America .  
Soon afterwards , Luo Gan went to the BMPSB 's police affairs center to watch the development of the Beijing municipal integrated public security information network and non-native population information system as well as a demonstration of the satellite positioning system for financial institution alarms and to hear reports on the state of the BMPSB 's science and technological planning for the 10th Five-Year Plan period and planning for the " Golden Shield Project . "  
While financial policies have more direct effects than monetary policies , the central treasury 's revenues in 1998 accounted only 6.1 percent of the GDP . The percentage increased a little in 1999 , but it was still a low 7.8 percent .  Financial policies can not possibly encourage internal demand unless these policies are applied in vital areas where they can really encourage consumption and nongovernmental investments .  
Meanwhile , several large-scale enterprises in Taiwan are facing a financial crisis , natural disasters have occurred repeatedly in agricultural production , and farmers have difficulties in selling their products despite falling prices .  People have lost their interest in Taiwan 's stocks .  How can the stock market be saved by a " cardiac stimulant ? "  
According to public opinion in Taiwan , Taiwan 's financial and economic policy has been swinging from side to side and various problems have arisen in its economy after the new authorities assumed power .  The unclear future of cross-strait relations , in particular , has been the fundamental cause of the stock market 's continuous fall .  
Also , according to public opinion , some people from the authorities should not indulge in " performances " and instead should put the Taiwan people 's well-being above everything else and publish feasible financial and economic policies and take measures to prevent the spread of disorderliness and outbreak of crises as soon as possible so as to create an internal and external environment favorable to the stock market 's recovery .  
Finance is the " heart " of modern economy and undermining the country 's financial order is comparable to stabbing the " heart " with a dagger .  If the wound is minor , the bank alone will suffer some financial loss ; and if the wound is deep , the case can trigger an economic crisis and the people will suffer .  
The Taiwan public believes that " diplomatic relations " established on " money " are like " fair weather friends , " and will not last long .  Moreover , the " financial aid " countries are all weak and backward countries , and are of absolutely no use .  
Zeng Peiyan indicated that in the future , economic work must uphold the guiding policy of expanding domestic demand ; grasp opportunities for development ; continue to implement a proactive financial policy ; accelerate the pace of reforms in the economic system and adjustments in economic structure ; exert effort on resolving significant contradictions in economic life ; and promote a sound cycle of development in the national economy .  
The opposition parties have been continuously bombarding the National Reunification Council , and the outlook for the " Chen-Lien Meeting " has changed .  Subsequently the roundtable of political parties may be in the dilemma of breaking up .  Moreover , discontent within the DPP as the minority ruling party is continuing to brew , with the grudge directed at the financial and economic cabinet members .  
In addition to striving to stabilize the political situation , plan economic reform , pacify Chechnya , reorganize the armed forces , and declare war on the increasingly influential financial oligarchs and local warlords , he has also been actively and steadily readjusting Russia 's foreign policy and intensely pursuing a pragmatic diplomacy .  
The CMC stressed the need to finish all the tasks of reducing the size of the armed forces by half a million in the last year of the three-year deadline .  Moreover , the armed forces should concentrate their limited financial resources on striving to effect , in the shortest possible time , a complete change from a manpower-intensive and numerically large type to a technology-intensive and quality-based efficient one to ensure that they can cope with a hi-tech local war that may break out at any time .  
The Supreme People 's Court has adjusted adjudication work arrangements .  It has established and improved its systems of criminal adjudication , civil adjudication , and administrative adjudication with Chinese characteristics , abolished its technical , financial , and headquarters affairs bureaus , established a bureau of administration and equipment for judicial operations to be in charge of the work of administrative management of judicial operations , and extensively downsized administrative departments while strengthening adjudication bodies .  
Since they assumed power , the new Taiwan authorities have not acted rationally and frequently implemented financial and economic policies which were contradictory to one another .  As Taiwan authorities are pursuing delaying tactics while waiting for changes , it is unlikely that the " three links " will be implemented within the foreseeable future .  
Over the past year , through reforming the government 's approval and auditing system , the province adopted the economic responsibility auditing system , improved the system for democratically recommending cadres , more strictly implemented the regulations for the work of party committees , and established the system for relevant leaders to submit their regular personal financial reports to show they are clean and uncorrupt All this comprehensively strengthened supervision over principal leaders .  
First of all , we should do a good job in scientific planning , accurately select the priority tasks , concentrate our financial and material resources on solving major problems that concern the overall development of the western region , and promote a comprehensive economic and social development .  
In the five years that will soon be over , China successfully has withstood the assaults of the financial crisis sweeping Asia .  Its national economy has maintained sustained , rapid , and healthy development ; its overall national strength has risen markedly ;  
If war breaks out , the blows dealt to Taiwan 's economy can not be compared to a minor power cut or a major earthquake ; the financial securities market will fall into serious chaos , the stock market will dive , there will be massive exchange rate turbulence , foreign investment will be withdrawn , and the entire Taiwan economy may be paralyzed , so Taiwan will find it very difficult to fight a protracted war with the mainland .  
While many national economic organizations , major businesses in the industrial , commercial , financial and other sectors and far-sighted personages in various walks of life in the United States actively urged Congress to pass the bill , more and more Congressmen also gave clear-cut support to permanent normal trade relations with China . Solving permanent normal trade relations with China has become the mainstream aspiration in the United States .  
Hit by the double whammy of the impact of the Asian financial crisis externally and its serious impact on exports , and the structural surpluses and anemic domestic demand internally , the Party Central Committee readjusted its macro-regulatory policy priorities in a timely manner , implementing aggressive fiscal policies and using various economic levers in an integrated fashion to expand domestic demand and curb the deflationary trend and promote the various reforms in a stable manner , which played a decisive role in overcoming the difficulties occasioned by the financial crisis and stimulating the economic recovery .  
Those attending the meetings included responsible officials in charge of combating corruption at its source in various provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal discipline inspection commissions , supervision departments , and financial departments ( or bureaus ) , as well as responsible officials of relevant departments under the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and the Ministry of Supervision .  
The main points of the reform are : With regard to the basic organizational form of budget , they exercised departmental budget control by putting funds of different characters having financial purposes in a unified budget so that the funds would go to the departments using them , changing the traditional practice of centralized management of funds by specialized departments .  
In January 1999 , a budget making and examination service center , under the provincial financial department , was set up , responsible for checking on individual and public expenses of various departments and on the special funds for enterprise development items .  
all expenses in a year are crystal clear ; and all internal financial departments do not need to : make a budget , apply for additional appropriations , care about their financial accounts , and set aside funds to meet unexpected needs .  Therefore , the budget is scientific and transparent , and the fund distribution is fair and just .  
Dai Xianglong said : China has extricated itself from the impact of the Asian financial crisis .  However , in face of the challenges of the financial globalization , the PBOC will continue to practice a moderate monetary policy , further the reform of interest rate marketization , institute a modern commercial banking system , further improve and perfect a unitary and well-managed floating exchange rate system taking the market supply and demand as its foundation , and open the financial sector wider to the world .  
The central bank should correctly handle the relations between preventing financial risks and supporting economic growth , work hard to enhance the level of manipulating monetary policy , regulate money supply in good time , provide positive guidance to credit orientation , give vigorous support to economic structural adjustment , guard against and defuse financial risks , and facilitate the steady rebound of the national economy .  
The " US National Interests Committee " which is composed of some strategic analysts also regards preventing those major global systems , including trade , financial markets , energy , and environmental realms , from disastrous collapse as a matter affecting the vital interests of the United States ( from the above-mentioned book about the US National Interests Committee , page 4 ) They believe that to ensure this kind of global interests , " the US resources are limited . "  
As a matter of fact , we did not make any substantive adjustment to the tax preferential policies toward foreign investors .  In 1997 , we intended to adjust the tax referential policy in terms of import equipment , but owing to the changes in macroeconomic situation such as the Asian financial crisis , we suspended the policy adjustment .  
and the East Asian countries have practiced a series of more favorable and open policies to attract foreign capital in an attempt to accelerate economic recovery in the wake of the Asian financial crisis .  In 1999 , the direct foreign investment in the Republic of Korea grew by 75.6 percent over the previous year , which is also an important factor leading to the decline of foreign capital flowing into China .  
The special administrative regional government , headed by Mr . Tung Chee-hwa , has been governing the region in accordance with the Basic Law and has gradually overcome the difficulties brought about by the Asian financial crisis , in addition to promoting an all-round economic recovery and consolidating Hong Kong 's status of being the international financial , trade , and shipping center .  
Today , when being interviewed by Xinhua , Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng said that in the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , China positively and actively applied the financial policies to conduct macroeconomic readjustment and control , and this played a major role in maintaining the sustained , high-speed , and healthy development of the national economy , promoting reforms in all fields , and safeguarding social stability .  
He pointed out : The positive financial policy being put into practice since 1998 has effectively driven economic growth , promoted the increase in financial revenues , successfully brought about a major turning point in the national economy in the first months of this year , created a favorable environment for reform and development , and also enriched our experience in macroeconomic management .  
set aside enough funds for their scientific research , development of new products , and depreciation ; take earnest steps to increase financial input in technological innovation and technical transformation ; and do more solid work in order to enhance their staying power for a future development .  
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , in terms of the fundamental implementation of goals for the reform and development of the banking industry , it is estimated that during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , combined domestic and foreign financial loans increased by a total of 5.8 trillion yuan , for an average annual increase of 13.9 percent ;  
A financial management company was established to purchase bad commercial bank loans which were nationally funded , the central bank 's capital filled out , branch structure reduced and consolidated , internal management strengthened , and the international assessment standard raised .  
At the beginning of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , continued management was given to the serious inflation problem , and an economic soft landing was achieved .  In the middle of the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , given the trend toward deflation , a policy of monetary stabilization was implemented , moving from the use of primarily direct control toward using methods of indirect financial control ;  
Second , in light of changes in the situation after China 's entry into the World Trade Organization , it will continue to deepen the reform of the fiscal revenue system , further improve the revenue-sharing system between the central and local governments , positively promote the reform of the fiscal budget system , improve the system of the transfer of payments by the Treasury , actively and steadily promote the transformation of administrative fees into taxes , and gradually establish a public financial framework that meets the needs of the socialist market economy .  
According to Wang Jun , the Ministry of Finance has adjusted its internal mechanism and functions to meet the requirements of the establishment of the new fiscal expenditure management system this year after fully taking into consideration the needs of major financial reforms such as the unified control of budgetary and extra-budgetary funds and the establishment of a centralized system of receipt and payment by the Treasury .  
The economy has maintained steady growth momentum in the first three quarters , and besides the impact of global economic recovery and the brisk international markets , the good situation is due largely to the state 's implementation of a positive financial policy , a sound monetary policy , and the policy to readjust the industrial structure .  
The committee members say that in order to improve the use-efficiency of funds raised through national debt issuance , the relevant parties must assume full responsibility and put a firm grip on the construction and management of the national debt-funded projects .  In particular , the many responsibility systems must be strengthened ; project construction and financial management must be properly supervised and checked , and violations of law and order must be investigated and stopped .  
To further give play to the advantages and potential of cooperation between Asia and Europe in the economic and trade , financial , scientific and technological aspects , Premier Zhu set forth five important proposals : First , expanding trade , investment , and financial cooperation between Asia and Europe to meet the needs in the optimization of the industrial structure .  
The statement calls on various countries to painstakingly contribute to maintaining the situation of world and regional security , establish a new international political and economic order , quicken the tempo of multilateral international trade and the opening up of regional organizations , intensify the economic and financial cooperation and scientific and technological exchanges between the two continents in the era of information , and so on .  
During his brief stay in the United States , Xiang Huaicheng also held talks with Summers and US National Economic Adviser Sperling [ si po lin ] .  The two sides exchanged views on international and domestic issues of common concern .  On 27 October , representatives of the Chinese Finance Ministry and the US Treasury Department will also hold a Sino-US financial dialogue and the first vice-ministerial-level session of the Sino-US Joint Economic Committee here to exchange views on such issues as capital markets , financial monitoring , corporate reorganization , and disclosure of accounting information .  
Both sides looked forward to the strengthening of cooperation in this regard .  They also noted that the APEC recently agreed to set up a working group that would conduct a survey of the domestic legal and regulatory frameworks for fighting financial crime in various economies .  
He expressed his concern for the sustainability of China 's medium-term fiscal policies , considering in particular the contingent liability of the financial sector as well as possible expenditures for the social security net , pension funds , infrastructure construction and environmental protection in future .  
Social security outlays as a percentage of total financial outlays will be further increased , and such methods as imposing a social security tax , reducing state owned shares , and expanding the issue of lotteries will be studied in the interest of establishing a pluralistic capital source , standardizing the social security system , and managing service socialization of the social security setup .  
The local people 's governments at all levels should adopt preferential policies for , offer financial support to , and step up supervision and management of the work of vocational education and training for demobilized servicemen and may also accept and settle in a planned way and in light of the needs of developing the western regions on a large scale some outstanding professional personnel among demobilized servicemen in the western regions . 
According to a financial official , the total quantity control of the no haste , be patient policy absolutely will have no precise restriction on figures , but will take foreign investment demand , the amount of domestic funds , and the rate of economic growth as indexes .  
The leaders instructed their ministers to formulate more effective strategies for economic restructuring , further improving the social security systems , optimizing governmental management , and creating a benign environment for financial institutions and industrial and commercial enterprises .  
China began to adopt the export rebate policy in 1985 .  Since 1998 , the state has increased the rates for export rebates three times in an effort to address the negative effects caused by the Asian financial crisis , as well as to stop the deflationary trend .  The moves have powerfully promoted export and contributed significantly to the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
In recent years , the United States has become more and more aware of the challenge brought by the sudden rise of China and regarded this as " one of the greatest challenges in making foreign policies for the 21st century . "  Any view that ignores or neglects China 's role is shortsighted and harmful .  In particular , after the Asian financial crisis , the United States has noted that China 's big power image is moving in a " positive direction , " and that China is a responsible power that can be cooperated with .  
Jeffrey Koo said : Advanced countries do not have many restrictions regarding sending back the investment made by transnational companies .  A long time ago when Taiwan did not have an ample foreign exchange reserve , it set a requirement , setting a yearly limit for Taiwan businessmen to remit money to foreign countries .  According to China 's current financial system , it is difficult for Taiwan businessmen to remit their profits back to Taiwan .  
In the process of investigation , the provincial committee for discipline , aside from confirming the facts about the huge bribes taken by Lin , has discovered that the Land Bureau and the Development Center both had adopted some serious illegal financial and economic regulations .  The establishment of a private treasury inside these institutions is very serious .  The amount in the treasury reaches several hundred million yuan in renminbi ;  
The FAMC should engage a certified public accountant acknowledged by the MOF to conduct annual audit of its financial position and submit audit reports to all relevant supervisory and administrative departments in a timely manner .  
At present , we should conscientiously study the knowledge relating to the socialist market economy , transform our concepts on financial and economic work , quicken the pace of building the public finance suited to China 's national conditions , further adjust and optimize the financial revenue-expenditure structure , incrementally reduce investment in the profit-making and operational spheres , vigorously cut down the administrative and institutional spending , push the operational institutions into the market , and concentrate the use of financial resources mainly on the areas of social and public necessities and social security .  
Li Lanqing stressed that to set up a framework of public finance , it is imperative to foster a new concept on financial management , and its basic ideas can be summarized in the following words : " Appropriate proportion , suitable centralization and decentralization , reasonable income and expenditure , and proper use of funds . "  
We should practice the international prevailing system of concentrated receipt and payment by the national treasury and intensify the unified control and management of government financial funds , so as to change once and for all the chaotic situation in the past characterized by the decentralized management of financial funds and multiple accounts opened by various departments and units .  
Liu Jiang emphasized that developed countries must take practical actions to perform their commitments according to the convention in technology transfer and financial support and in satisfying specific needs of developing countries so as to narrow the widening South-North wealth gap and science and technology gap and realistically solve the climate change problem .  
In addition , we must strengthen the development of the contingent of cadres and try hard to build a contingent of fiscal and financial cadres who are smart and capable , highly efficient , honest , and pragmatic .  
Furthermore , they should closely serve the objectives and tasks of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " ; make relevant predictions and formulate countermeasures to deal with problems that might appear in the course of development ; strictly prevent and crack down on serious economic criminal activities including smuggling , fraudulence in foreign exchange transactions , obstruction of the order of financial management , financial fraudulence , and manufacturing and sales of fake and substandard commodities ;  
Foci of the crackdowns against various economic crimes include : the smuggling and sale of smuggled goods , tax cheating , threatening of tax collectors , undermining of financial management order , fraud , production and sale of counterfeit and inferior quality products , and violation of intellectual property rights .  
It is necessary to intensify the support of the financial industry for economic growth and encourage all circles of society to increase their investment .  The pace of the preliminary work for major projects , such as the northward transfer of southern water and Qinghai-Tibet railway , should be quickened , with project quality management and financial management improved .  
Following Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's strategic thinking characterized by its broad and long-term view , the Party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , established Shanghai 's strategic position and asked the municipality to be turned into an international economic , financial , and trade center as soon as possible .  
In addition , a report published by a foreign firm Solomen Meibang [ name as transliterated ] , Taiwan 's banks currently have potential bad debts totaling NT $ 1.7 trillion to NT $ 2 trillion .  More enterprises are expected to default on their loans in the next six months , which would lead to bankruptcy of some peripheral financial institutions .  
In the near term , the continuous practice of the proactive financial policies and moderate monetary policies is the concrete measure for carrying out the policy of expanding domestic demand , which is needed to ensure the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
By going through comprehensive development , enlarging investment in fundamental facilities , implementing financial transfers and payments , and other measures , Guangdong has increased support for 16 impoverished counties , causing the entire province 's national economy [ as received ] to maintain rapid growth .  
Only as a result of extricating large - and medium-sized state-owned enterprises carrying excessive debt and bogged down in difficulties from these difficulties , integrating reforms for state-owned commercial banks that concentrate on disposal of bad assets , and the State adopting resolute measures for transforming the banks ' partial creditor 's rights in these enterprises into the shareholder 's rights of financial asset management companies will some products be enabled to have a market , prospect for development , advanced technology , a good operational foundation , and a strong leadership team .  
If the fund is used in advance , the authorities will have no money to use once an incident occurs.Last year , the old authorities agreed to release a special fund in NT $ 14.3 billion before the new fiscal year began to help resolve financial problems faced by counties and cities .  
Li Lanqing said in his letter that under the leadership of the party 's central committee and the State Council , significant headway has been made in financial reforms and tremendous achievements have been scored in the financial work over the past few years , as a result of practicing the proactive financial policies and intensifying and improving the macroeconomic regulation and control in finance , which have promoted the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Measures should be taken to ensure that the salaries of staff and workers in the administrative units and public institutions are paid in full and on time , resolve the problem of salaries in arrears that exists in the units at county and township levels in real earnest , and further do a good job of the unified payment of salaries and financial expenses in the party and government organs and educational departments .  
Third , great efforts should be made to carry out the reform of financial expense management structure and perfect the reform of taxation system , positively practice the centralized treasury receipt and payment system , tighten the unified transfer and management of the government 's financial funds , and radically change the previous chaotic situation of decentralized management of financial funds and multiple accounts opened by departments and units . 
At present , financial departments at all levels should foster the idea of managing the public finance in a conscientious way and change their financial management model from the old tradition of laying more weight on distribution than on management , more weight on examination and approval than on supervision , and more weight on microeconomy than on macroeconomy to the practice of intensifying macroeconomic regulation and control , macroscopic management , and financial supervision .  
Economically , stock prices have fallen sharply , the real estate market is sluggish , many traditional industries have totally moved out of the island , and a financial storm is looming ahead .  The economy has continued to decline , and with the end of the year drawing near , enterprises are meeting with difficulties in settling their debts , while there is a sharp rise in the number of jobless people .  Because of this , the local people have no confidence in Taiwan 's future .  
If economic growth slows down or if recession emerges in following years , original estimated revenue will decrease and the Bush administration will be caught in a dilemma in a tax cut .  It will either cause new financial deficits by cutting tax according to the original plan or be dissatisfied by enterprises and the broad masses of voters , especially people of the upper middle class , if he shrinks the size of a tax cut .  
We must adhere to the principle of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement a proactive financial policy and a moderate monetary policy , comprehensively use all means of macroeconomic regulation and control to consolidate and develop the good situation of economic growth and promote the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy and comprehensive social progress , and strive to make a good start in fulfilling the Tenth Five-year Plan .  
As Shanghai is the main pillar of the national strategy to turn it into an international economic , financial , and trading center , our goal is to make every effort to raise Shanghai 's comprehensive competitiveness , so that it will play a more important role in serving the entire nation and in participating in the world economic competition .  
With regard to the rapidly worsening financial situation of Agriculture Council credit departments , Control Yuan Member Kuo Shi-chi pointed out after releasing the survey that the ratio of non-agricultural loans provided by Agriculture Council credit departments has increased in recent years ; the credit departments ' system of credit rating and extending credit is unsound and most credit-receiving customers are of the higher-risk marginal group rejected by big banks .  As a result , the ratio of overdue loans has increased drastically and already reached 16.1 percent in 1999 .  
Wu Yi said , under the " Ninth Five-year Plan , " China successfully overcame a series of foreign economic and trade problems , especially those created by the Asian financial crises ; the many undertakings continued to expand to become an important driving force behind the nation 's economic development , playing an important role in promoting macroeconomic stability and increasing the country 's comprehensive national strength .  
Moreover , we should improve a financial structure for supporting foreign trade and economic cooperation focusing on export credits and export insurance , promote the organic combination of export credit insurance and export financing business , and establish a foreign-related economic and legal system , which is relatively perfect and conforms to WTO rules and China 's national condition ;  
While continuing to investigate and deal with cases such as corruption , bribery , embezzlement of public funds , smuggling and peddling contraband , tax and foreign exchange fraud , and financial swindling , we must pay attention to investigating and handling serious cases of violations of political , organizational , and personnel discipline by leading cadres ; cases of serious dereliction of duty ; cases of leading cadres ' spouses , sons and daughters , and relatives taking advantage of the influence of the leading cadres ' powers and position to pursue illegal profit ;  
The policies and measures involved in the circular included increasing construction fund , giving priority to launching construction projects , stepping up transfer of financial payment , strengthening support for financial loan , implementing a preferential taxation policy , implementing a preferential policy on land and mineral resources , further expanding the area of foreign investment , expanding the channel of foreign capital utilization , and increasing educational investment .  
Zeng Peiyan said : In 1998 , the CPC Central Committee decided to implement a proactive fiscal policy in order to overcome the adverse impact of the Asian financial crisis , expand domestic demand , and maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy national development .  
Tang Jiaxuan pointed out that China will continue to unswervingly pursue a peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , make efforts to advocate world multipolarization , actively deal with economic globalization , further participate in international economic and trade , financial , and science and technology cooperation and regional cooperation , work to promote the establishment of a fair and rational new international political and economic order , and spur mankind 's just cause of peace and development .  
In short , we should vigorously facilitate the rational circulation and optimum allocation of production elements to ensure that material , financial , and human resources are turned to best account and bring into full play the role of markets and resources at home and abroad in the large-scale western development .  
In 1998 , in order to counter the adverse effects of the Asian financial crisis and continue the national economy 's sustained , rapid , and healthy development , the Party Central Committee decided to implement a policy to expand domestic demand by issuing more treasury bonds to finance long-term construction projects and strengthen infrastructure constructions .  
At the same time , Taiwan 's financial authorities were forced to admit that the rate of Taiwan banks ' overdue loans has already reached 8 percent and more , and bad loans have reached more than $ 1.2 trillion NTD ; whether or not a large-scale or " local style " financial upheaval will explode in Taiwan has become a hot topic in international economic circles .  
To obtain windfall profits , some criminal elements build connections with leading cadres in various ways and corrupt them by bribing them with a large amount of money or through providing them with sexual services .  Over-concentration of power in some cadres , a lack of transparency in the exercise of power as well as a lack of an effective oversight and check system against abuse of powers give rise to corruption like the exchange of power for money .  In addition , because of the state 's limited financial power , public servants ' pay is low .  
The reform of rural credit cooperatives should limit to correcting the direction of persistently serving " three aspects of agriculture " ; and should strive to attain the goal of clearly defining relations between ownership and management , improving and perfecting the structure of management by legal persons , guarding against financial risks , changing the management style , reinforcing internal management , and keeping bad debts and operational losses under strict control .  
However , taking into consideration the negative impact of the expansionary financial policy , there is a need to adjust the focus of the macropolicy in a timely manner and correspondingly weaken the " primary " impetus , to prevent the excessive accumulation of negative effects resulting from the prolonged implementation of the policy on expansionary demand and fully invigorate the vitality of supply and civilian-run enterprises by strengthening the " secondary " impetus , thereby laying a solid foundation for the long-term , sustained stability of the national economy .  
China 's banking , securities , and insurance systems have earnestly implemented the central authorities ' financial policies and measures , pursued prudent monetary policies , effectively supported industrial restructuring , and effectively helped state enterprises in resolving their difficulties and restructuring .  
Wu Bangguo indicated : At present , China has already shaken off the adverse influences of the Asian financial crisis , a smooth progress has been registered in the country 's strategic readjustments to its economic structure , the three-year target for the reform and the difficulty-relief work of state enterprises has been basically fulfilled , and China 's national economic development has taken a major turn for the better and has maintained the momentum of a fairly fast growth .  
Responsible comrades of the organizational , institutional structuring , financial , and pharmaceutical supervision and management departments of the party committees and people 's governments of all provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities and responsible comrades of the relevant departments of the people 's governments of the cities with independent budgetary status and cities at the deputy provincial level , the Xinjiang Production Corps , and other relevant central and State Council departments attended the meeting .  
Dai Xianglong said : It is necessary to continuously maintain an appropriate growth of money supply .  The planned targets of credit regulation and control for 2001 are as follows : The broad money ( M2 ) is projected to grow by 13 percent to 14 percent , and the narrow money ( M1 ) 15 percent to 16 percent ; net cash injection will be kept within 150 billion yuan , while the aggregate loans by financial institutions are expected to grow by 1.3 trillion yuan .  
The meeting gave a preliminary analysis and forecast for the 2001 financial situation .  It endorsed the PBOC 's anticipated targets of monetary and credit control : M2 is projected to grow by 13 to 14 percent and M1 15 to 16 percent .  Net cash injection will be kept within 150 billion yuan , while the aggregate loans by financial institutions are expected to growth by 1.3 trillion yuan , about the same level as last year .  
The quality and efficiency of economic growth was markedly improved , financial revenue also increased by a big margin , the readjustment of the economic structure was being actively advanced , and reforms in all aspects were being carried forward in depth .  The scope of opening up to the outside world was further expanded .  Comprehensive development was made in the fields of science and technology , education , culture , public health , sports , and all other social undertakings .  
All this will definitely provide various business opportunities for Hong Kong . For example , Hong Kong may raise and provide funds , financial services , and other relevant professional service for the development projects in the western part of China , and may directly launch investment projects there as well .  The local advantages in the interior areas may be used in cooperative production , and the products may be exported and directly shipped to domestic markets in other areas .  
In order to survive and develop in face of the fierce international competition after China 's WTO entry and the gradual financial integration in the world , China 's large enterprises have continuously quickened their pace for restructuring .  They have also gone overseas to list their shares and enhanced their actual strength to meet international challenges .  
Zhu Mingxian said : At the critical period of China 's economic structural adjustment , it is imperative to firmly seize the quality work as the main direction of attack , which is of extremely important significance to expanding domestic demands and practicing the proactive financial policy .  
The appointment of Donald Tsang , who is familiar with government operations , as chief secretary for administration , and the appointment of Antony Leung , who is a member of the Executive Council and a financier , as financial secretary , however , avoided a great change in the positions of senior officials , and showed the possibility of bringing qualified people in the private sector into the civil service system , thus strengthening the government .  The appointments are laudable .  
While acting as the financial secretary , he personally understood the principle of " one country , two systems " was fully put into effect , and thus enhanced his faith in serving the SAR Government and contributing to the implementation of the principle .  On the recommendation of the chief executive , the State Council appointed Donald Tsang as chief secretary for administration to coordinate government operations and lead 180,000 civil servants .  
At this historical juncture , in using its social resources and in its industrial restructuring , Hong Kong must put greater stress on cost-effectiveness and on increasing its value-adding ability .  It is wise to allow an international financier to plan financial and industrial work , because he is in a better position to : understand the needs of various industries , create new ideas , amass talents , create new industries , and achieve optimum allocation of resources .  Antony Leung will , like his predecessor , handle financial matters with circumspection .  
China must go further to expand domestic demand , promote sustained and stable economic development , and can not depend for a long time on methods of borrowing money from national financial organs .  It must expand the vigor of non-government investment , and make up an investment system and mechanism for the entire society that is driven by finance and investment , and in which non-government investment actively participates .  
The improvement of the state 's macroeconomic environment mainly included the adoption of a proactive financial policy and moderate monetary policy , the expansion of domestic demands , and the promotion of economic growth by means of investment , consumption , and export , which have played an excellent role in improving the external environment for enterprises ' production and operation .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out : Since last year , a number of counties and cities in Anhui Province and other provinces and autonomous regions have carried out the trial reform of taxes and charges in rural areas in accordance with the arrangements made by the party Central Committee and the State Council , and have achieved initial good results .  First , the peasants ' burdens have been reduced by a great extent and the " arbitrary collection of fees , unreasonable penalties and unjustified financial levies " has been effectively curtailed .  
The reform policy is to tackle the current actual situation in rural areas , and is supported by the broad masses of peasants and cadres at the grassroots level .  It is a policy to fundamentally solve the problem of the " arbitrary collection of fees , unreasonable penalties and unjustified financial levies " in rural areas , to reduce the peasants ' burdens , and to protect and whip up the peasants ' enthusiasm for production .  
Responsible persons of various provinces , autonomous regions , municipalities directly under the jurisdiction of the central authorities , and the Xinjiang Production-Construction Corps ; responsible persons of concerned ministries and departments of the party Central Committee , the National People 's Congress and the State Council ; and responsible persons of offices of leading groups of financial and agricultural departments and commissions of various provinces , autonomous regions and municipalities for the reform of taxes and charges in rural areas attended the meeting .  
The direct cause of the inability to reduce farmers ' burden is that township financial budgets have to support too great a population , have to meet goals and upgrade in various activities , and complete " cosmetic projects " which can not be halted despite repeated attempts to do so .  This leaves townships with weak financial budgets and a heavy debt load .  
The economists held that the current financial system in our country can not meet the requirements of getting accession into the World Trade Organization . In particular , the state-owned commercial banks will be facing sterner challenges , and the issue of bad assets will become more serious .  It is necessary to explore an effective and feasible solution .  
Using high technologies , starting from on high to deal with China in the outer space to attract China 's attention , making it concentrate its entire financial , material and human resources , as the former Soviet Union did , on an arms race in the outer space .  Then , cutting the ground from under China 's foot , completely do China in .  Such kind of calculations based on wishful thinking , to be sure , is also very laughable .  
As pointed out by Regina Ip , the Hong Kong Association of Falun Dafa is no ordinary organization .  Besides being heretical and making people obsessed , it is also a tightly built organization with strong mobilization power and financial resources and is targeting itself directly at the central authorities .  Its activities have caused public concern , and it is also necessary for the government to pay attention to their activities .  
Li Lanqing called for the governments at all levels to highly value the literary , artistic , and sports undertaking , regard it as a major component of the building of socialist spiritual civilization , increase the intensity of financial input , and give correct guidance to further advance the literary , artistic , and sports undertaking .  
Wang Zhiqiong cited the 1998 statistics and said : In 1998 , the input made by the Chinese Government in the field of public health amounted to 58.72 billion yuan , but only 9.25 billion yuan was actually used in rural areas , accounting for only 15.9 percent of the total medical expenditure .  As a result of the insufficient financial input in rural public health undertakings , many grass-roots hospitals and clinics remain in very poor conditions .  Buildings are simple and crude ;  
Deputy Zhang Baoyi , mayor of Zhangjiakou City , said : This is an amazing achievement .  These years , the work of aiding the poor to tackle difficult problems has been done as an important task from the central to local levels , and actual results have been achieved from formulating policies to inputting human , financial , and material resources into this work .  
The relevant department disclosed that the Chinese People 's Liberation Army will increase the salaries and benefits of its officers and soldiers ( including the salaries of nonmilitary personnel and the allowances for soldiers ) next month .  The increase rate is about 25 percent over the current salaries .  This expense will be incorporated in the total military spending budget worked out by Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng under the national financial expenditure for this year .  
CPPCC member and Shanghai Fuxing High Tech ( Group ) Inc . CEO Guo Guangchang said that when China joins the WTO , the dynamics of financial opening to foreign counties will increase further , presenting our domestic economic and fiscal reform with new opportunities and challenges .  Opening up a non-government owned and operated bank market and preparing to establish non-government owned and operated banks is essential , and in every aspect of this the prerequisites have already matured .  
He says : Anhui and some other local areas have been quite successful in launching pilot projects of reforming their tax and fee collection systems .  The pilot projects have set the financial obligations for the peasants , the state , and the collectives ; effectively reduced the peasants ' burdens , and stopped the collection of unwarranted levies , fines , and obligations in the rural areas .  
The year 2000 was the third year in which the country implemented an active fiscal policy .  As result of the investment projects , financed with the capital obtained from floating national bonds , the economic growth increased 1.7 percent .  That was another significant contribution the active financial policy made for the national economic growth following the additional economic growths of 1.5 and 2 percent 1998 and 1999 , respectively .  
We are also facing the arduous tasks of reforming the education and scientific research systems , the administrative system , the financial system , the investment system , the taxation system , the foreign trade system , the social security system , the income distribution system , the medical and public health system , and especially the leadership system , the economic system , and the management systems in all aspects .  In some fields , reforms have just be started .  
The ' outline ' points out that in order to establish and perfect financial organization systems , market systems , oversight systems , and regulation and control systems , there must be comprehensive reform of the commercial banks wholly owned by the state .  Qualified commercial banks that are wholly owned by the state can be reorganized into share-holding commercial banks in which the state controls the shares .  Other measures include the establishment of risk prevention mechanisms , improving competitiveness , and so forth .  
Zeng Peiyan said : Implementing the proactive financial policy and increasing the issuance of long-term treasury bonds for construction projects is one of the key measures for effectively resisting Asian financial risks and maintaining a sustained , rapid and sound economic development .  
Judging from the possibilities , given the current rich material resources , abundant funds , fairly low prices , and the fact that the proportion of the balance of debts in the GDP and other targets are within the international safety warning line , China 's financial sector can withstand the strains .

Rather , what China did was make a resolute policy decision , adopting a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy .

Enjoying economic prosperity and stability and the further elevation of its international standing , China occupies a rising position in the US global strategy .  Even US security and prosperity increasingly depends on the development of Sino-US relations .  
The Bush administration 's foreign-policy team is still intoxicated with irrational economic prosperity in the 1990s , and it has not yet realized that the biggest challenge the United States is going to face will not a military but an economic one ; the fatal weakness of the Bush administration is that its senior financial and economic officials lack the prestige to stabilize the confidence of Wall Street investors .

Hong Kong is a city known throughout the world for its fast pace and in our financial market , every second counts .  Take our stock market as an example .  Although its turnover has repeatedly set record highs of late , the automatic trading system of the Stock Exchange can still maintain the rate of completing automatic matching within two seconds and the clearing and settlement systems of the stock and futures markets as well as the banks still operate properly .  
He emphasized that the long-standing objective of the Government was to maintain an overall environment favourable to economic growth , through providing a sound legal and institutional framework , a simple tax system with low tax rate , a stable financial sector , well - developed infrastructure and an efficient Government machinery .  
The four important pillars which underpinned Hong Kong 's economic success before the changeover , which are the rule of law , a level playing field for all who do business in Hong Kong , a corruption-free public service and free flow of information , have all remained to ensure Hong Kong 's continued success as it takes on its new role as China 's premier international financial centre .

The developed countries are advanced in science and technology and strong in financial capital , while the developing countries are rich in natural and human resources and large in market potential .

The Chief Executive said Hong Kong was fortunate , and had incomparable advantages , such as a high degree of autonomy under the ' One Country , Two Systems ' concept , abundant financial reserves , social and economic systems that worked well and a sound , comprehensive legal system .  
" We are the freest society and most vibrant economy of our time because Hong Kong has always practised free enterprise and free trade , insisted on prudent financial management policies and keeping a low taxation system , upheld the rule of law and placed emphasis on an efficient , executive-led government and a quality oriented civil service , " he said .

The IMF Mission noted that the existing policy framework , including the linked exchange rate system , prudent fiscal policy , careful supervision of the financial sector and non-interventionist approach in factor markets , has proved to be effective and resilient in withstanding external pressures on the Hong Kong market .

Hong Kong has a sound and effective financial monitoring system ; ample fiscal reserves as well as prudent financial management policies .  The Government is free of any foreign debts .  Private firms also exercise financial prudence when seeking foreign loans .  
Our sound economic foundation , huge fiscal reserves and effective financial systems and monitoring mechanism are abundant proof of our capability to maintain the currency linkage .  
Mr Tung stressed that in the face of this financial situation , the Government 's most important task at hand was to take firm and resolute measures to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong 's economic system .  To achieve this , it was vital for us to defend the linked exchange rate , and the Government was determined to do so .  
" Our sound economic foundation , huge fiscal reserves and effective financial systems and monitoring mechanism are abundant proof of our capability to maintain the currency linkage .

Mr Wong pointed out that new initiatives would be introduced in eight key areas to further improve the quality of basic education .  The eight areas include QEF , biliteracy and trilingualism , information technology in education , improving the learning environment , improving the quality of teachers , catering for special education needs , administrative support to schools ; and financial assistance for needy students .  
As regards financial assistance to needy students , it comes under two main categories : ( i ) travel subsidy will be provided to about 19,000 needy public sector primary school pupils residing outside Primary One Admission Nets at a recurrent cost of $ 22.7 million a year , and ( ii ) the School Textbook Assistance Scheme will be extended to benefit about 100,000 Secondary 4 to 7 students at a recurrent cost of $ 74 million .  
" Of this , $ 16.2 billion comes from higher than expected receipts from stamp duty , reflecting the exceptional level of turnover in both the stock and property markets in the first half of the financial year . 
Reiterating the Government 's firm commitment to establish Mandatory Provident Fund schemes to give the working population a viable and sustainable retirement benefit system , Mr Tsang said he intended to use the tax system to help the development of secure provision for the financial needs of the retired in future . 
Mr Tong admitted that the unwavering stance taken to protect the peg had brought about short term problems , such as increases in interest rates , but with a solid economic foundation , a huge fiscal reserve and a sound financial and monitoring system , Hong Kong is confident that it will be among the first - - if not the first - - to rebound .  
" Of course , our US $ 92.8 billion foreign reserves , the third largest in the world , and our healthy banking and financial systems as well as our strong economic fundamentals , have all played a vital role in enabling us to maintain the linked exchange rate , " he said .  
Mr Tong admitted that the unwavering stance taken to protect the peg had brought about short term problems , such as increases in interest rates , but with a solid economic foundation , a huge fiscal reserve and a sound financial and monitoring system , Hong Kong is confident that it will be among the first - if not the first - to rebound . 
Mr Little said that apart from legal co-operation arrangements , the Basic Law also authorises the Hong Kong SAR to enter into binding international agreements with foreign States and international organisations in various fields including economic , trade , financial and monetary , shipping , communications , tourism , cultural and sport .  
" Second , the financial situation in Korea has stabilised because the world finally realised that financial crises can not be solved by official funds alone , but a combination of IMF funding and conditionality , plus voluntary rollovers provided by international banking institutions .  This appears to be the right way forward .  
He said that while the financial turmoil had forced other countries to cut back on infrastructure and social programmes , Hong Kong 's excellent finances - with fiscal reserves of more than HK $ 450 billion - were allowing it to push ahead with massive investments .  
The Government has considered the relevant issues and has no reason to believe that the case offends Hong Kong 's constitutional system or notions of substantial justice and would be likely to have a significant and adverse effect on Hong Kong 's trade with the overseas jurisdiction concerned or on Hong Kong 's financial system .  
" I think , if anything , Hong Kong represents a model of economic management others in Asia are now realising they should try to follow : a free market under the rule of law ; a clean government which believes in prudent financial management and in not directing the economy ; a well-regulated and well-managed financial sector ; a reputation for playing by the rules ; openness and accountability , " Mr Tsang concluded .  
During the recent financial turmoil in Asia , the Government of the HKSAR , with its stable public finances and healthy fiscal reserves , has formulated on its own appropriate measures to deal with the problem and has successfully maintained the stability of the linked exchange rate .  Hong Kong continues to prosper and maintain its status as a leading international shipping , trade , financial and business centre .  
" Members are appointed in their personal capacity , and include professionals , financial administrators , businessmen , academics , social workers , public rental housing and subsidised home ownership flat residents , and members of the Executive Council , Provisional Urban Council , Provisional Regional Council and Provisional District Boards , " Mr Wong said .  
First and foremost because for years we have practised very prudent sound financial policies .  Year after year , since the linked exchange rate was established , our fiscal reserves every year average about 2% of GDP . And in the year just closed , March 31 , 1998 , our budget surplus was a full 5.8% of GDP .  
He stressed that Hong Kong 's solid economic foundation , strong fiscal reserves as well as sound banking and financial practices are the principal factors that will help Hong Kong recover sooner than most of its neighbours .  
Our confidence in Hong Kong 's prosperous future has not been eroded by the Asian financial turmoil .  In the coming five years , the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will invest HK $ 235 billion in a wide range of large-scale infrastructural projects , including the construction of railways , highways and educational facilities , to consolidate further the foundation for the long term development of Hong Kong and for the enhancement of Hong Kong 's competitiveness .  
" The currency turmoil is telling us how and why our wealth could be cut by half because of weaknesses in the financial intermediation process in Asia which made us vulnerable to volatile speculative capital flows , " said Mr Yam .  
Third , Hong Kong 's financial market has been very active in developing securities derivative products relating to mainland enterprises .  It has been able to provide a wide variety of financial products and make red chips and H-shares more attractive to institutional investors , thereby deepening the market for red chips and H-shares .  
" I hope the guests here will have a more comprehensive understanding of Hong Kong 's financial market through this seminar .  I would also like to see that many more companies in Dalian will have their shares traded on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong in future .  This will be a great step forward in the relations between the two important economic centres in north and south China , " she added .  
" We have in place a business friendly environment , a prudent fiscal policy , a simple tax system with low tax rates , a sound financial system , first-class infrastructure and sophisticated support services .  
" All the favourable conditions in Hong Kong which have underpinned our robust development in the past , such as our prudent financial policy , low taxation , sound financial and banking regulation , first-rate infrastructural facilities are still there and unaffected by external factors . " 
This is underpinned in particular by sustained high economic growth and further reform and opening up in the Mainland will provide ample opportunities for Hong Kong . Additionally , our past prudent financial management has produced very strong fiscal reserve which will provide a solid base for a strong recovery in a not too distant future . "  
Our attractions are manifold .  Among those most commonly cited are our superb physical infrastructure , our simple tax regime and low tax rates , our well developed financial support services and regulatory system , the rule of law and in general a very business-friendly environment .  
Furthermore , there are the rule of law , a low and predictable tax regime , an efficient and honest civil service , free flow of information and an efficient and sound financial system .  
" Events during the last 15 years have demonstrated how Hong Kong and the dollar link have weathered the storm - the 1987 stock market crash , the 1989 June 4 incident in Beijing , the 1990 Gulf War , the 1995 Mexican peso crisis , and now the Asian financial crunch .  " Today , it is the only freely convertible currency in the region that has survived the turmoil unscathed , " Mrs Chan said .  Mrs Chan went on to talk about our impressive track record of exchange rate stability .  
The Chief Secretary for Administration also noted other vital elements for maintaining confidence in Hong Kong as an international financial centre - a small , competent and clean administration ; a sophisticated currency board system which protected the linked currency exchange rate ; a sound monetary system , a well supervised and generally healthy banking sector ; tight fiscal discipline ; surplus budgets and strong reserves .  
It allows us complete financial autonomy , and the independence of our monetary system .  It establishes Hong Kong as a separate customs territory , and enables us to work directly with the international community to control trade in strategic commodities , drugs , illegal transhipments , and to protect intellectual property rights .  
It has been pointed out that in the late 80s and early 90s , the capacity and willingness of Western financial institutions to reach out for more exotic high-yielding investment made private sectors of major emerging economies with strong growth potential their prime target . 
Our robust financial system and monetary management mechanism , modern and prudent supervision have laid a solid foundation for a stable exchange rate .  
Our robust financial system and monetary management mechanism , modern and prudent supervision as well as sophisticated financial infrastructure have laid a solid foundation for a stable exchange rate .  
But I can say for sure that our financial foundation is very solid , our monetary system is robust , our currency , backed up by the currency board arrangement , is stable .  Our policies to stick to the linked exchange rate system and prudent fiscal management will remain unchanged .  
In order to maintain the total number of general holidays ( other than Sundays ) at the present level of 17 days a year , a consultation exercise was held earlier this year , when employers ' and employees ' organisations , the financial services sector and religious bodies were asked to advise which existing general but not statutory holidays should be used to offset the new general holidays for Labour Day and the Buddha 's Birthday .  
While I do not dispute the conceptual validity of this argument , I must point out that when we are faced with real and mounting financial problems with dangerous repercussions , speedy and decisive corrective action is essential for preventing a widespread systemic collapse .  
In macro terms , this means greater transparency and disclosure , greater accountability , stronger domestic financial systems , liberal trade , open financial markets , a high quality of regulation , and independent legal processes .  
The challenge ahead is to promote shared growth , to forestall future crises , and to design a new international financial architecture that promotes resilient financial systems , efficient global resource allocation and a level playing field .  
Indeed , Hong Kong has run into unprecedented problems .  Yet we also enjoy today a number of advantages , such as huge fiscal reserves , prudent financial management policies , a sound monetary system , strong development on the mainland as our backup and a high degree of autonomy , which we have never had before .  
However , with the entrepreneurial spirit of the Hong Kong people , expanding economy of the Mainland together with the traditional prudent financial management , sound banking system , huge foreign exchange reserve that support a stable exchange rate , we continue to look forward to our future with confidence .  
" We represent the model of sound economic management in the region : a truly free market operating under the rule of law ; a well-regulated financial sector ; and a clean government that has exercised great prudence in fiscal management , " he said .  
The statement found that an additional 80 ha of land would need to be reclaimed in the Central and Wanchai Districts for constructing key transport infrastructure ; transforming the existing waterfront to make it more accessible for the enjoyment and use of the public ; and providing space for the future expansion of the Central Business District to enable Hong Kong to continue to maintain its role as a highly competitive international financial and services centre .  
These systems include the rule of law ; a level playing field for doing business ; a corruption-free and politically-neutral civil service ; open and transparent financial markets ; a fast and unfettered flow of information network and last but not least , a tried and tested policy of limiting Government spending to within the trend growth rate of Gross Domestic Product .  
" I have maintained close contact with international business and financial leaders in order to have a better grasp of the current global economic climate .  I also explain to them the purpose of our policies , in particular those implemented and being planned for the financial markets . "  
However , in view of the fact that the Scheme has been in existence for just a short while , we consider it more appropriate for the Scheme to operate for a longer period of time to allow the relevant government departments as well as financial institutions and small and medium enterprises participating in the Scheme alike to accumulate adequate practical experience for areas for improvement to be identified .  
It is learnt that Hongkong Telecom was in breach of the provisions of its licence some time ago by offering discounts to its IDD call customers without the prior authorisation of the Telecommunications Authority . A financial penalty was imposed on Hongkong Telecom as a result and the company was required to recover the shortfalls between the approved rates and the unauthorised discounted rates from the customers concerned .  
The meetings covered a wide range of topics including the need for more transparency in international capital flows , the East Asian financial crisis , Japan 's economic performance , the upcoming World Bank / IMF meeting in Washington , Hong Kong 's role as an international financial centre and the successful implementation of the ' one country , two systems concept ' .  
Talks focused on looming global economic problems , disparities between the speed at which financial markets have developed and the regulatory frameworks governing such activities , China 's emergence as a global economic power and its role as a stabilising factor within Asia , and the impact of the Euro on Asian and global financial markets .  
The Financial Secretary , Mr Donald Tsang , says there is a growing consensus among Hong Kong 's major trading partners that there needs to be ' quick and decisive ' efforts to deal with the current global economic and financial crisis .  
Given sustained expansion and hence demand for capital on the Mainland , as well as the recovery of our economy , Mr Tung said he expected the overall size of our stock market to increase as the current global financial uncertainties receded .

While we will exert ourselves in achieving this objective , I believe that we also need to take account , in my view , of four main factors which will be crucial to our recovery .  These are : an improvement in the external , financial and economic environment ; a steadying of our interest rates here ; stability in the property market ; and above all , a return of public confidence .  
In conclusion , Mr Tong explained that in spite of the projected negative growth rate of 4 per cent for 1998 , the territory with its vast fiscal reserves , and sound financial and monetary system , will be able to ride out the storm and continue with the implementation of its major infrastructure projects .  
Although the accumulated reserves of HK $ 450 billion gave Hong Kong the financial strength to tide over present difficulties , the Government must find the resources to continue to invest in the future , and to provide the modern infrastructure in supporting Hong Kong 's role as a major economic player on the world stage , she said .  
He stressed that Hong Kong 's economic fundamentals were very strong , and together with its huge foreign currency reserves , a stable currency , and excellent financial and banking systems , the territory 's recovery from the downturn would be amongst the first in the region . 
The government has faced criticism about its economic forecasts .  Some have said - that we have been complacent , myopic , unable to keep track on development and inaccurate in our forecasts .  We estimate that GDP will contract about 4% in 1998 .  This is a substantial downward adjustment on the figures released in the Budget when the full scope of the Asian financial crisis was not yet known .  
Domestic financial laxity and economic policy distortions were common factors in Asia . The wild swings of fast-flowing and highly-leveraged speculative capital in narrower emerging markets led to strong overshoots which were highly destabilising and severely eroded investor and consumer confidence .  
Given both the cost of the relief measures announced on June 22 , and the effects of the current global financial crisis , we expect the budget deficit for the current year to be substantially in excess of $ 20 billion , which will entail an equivalent reduction in the level of the fiscal reserves .  
" The financial position of Hong Kong 's banking system and the quality of the regulatory and supervisory system are very strong by international standards , and that the impact of the regional crisis on the banking system will be manageable " , said Ms Wanda Tseng , Deputy Director of the Asia and Pacific Department who was in Hong Kong with the Mission .  
( c ) whether measures will be adopted to narrow down the current differential between the deposit rate and the lending rate to the 2 per cent level which was the prevailing interest rate spread prior to the financial turmoil ; if so , what the details are ; if not , why not ; and  
The dialogue on the financial crisis covered several topics , which included the strengthening of financial and legal systems , recapitalising banks affected by bad debts , the use of savings to build domestic bond and securities markets and ways to guard against contagion during regional economic turmoil .  
" The financial position of Hong Kong 's banking system and the quality of the regulatory and supervisory system are very strong by international standards , and that the impact of the regional crisis on the banking system will be manageable " , said Ms Wanda Tseng , Deputy Director of the Asia and Pacific Department who was in Hong Kong with the Mission .  
These included Japan 's economic recovery packages , financial and corporate sector restructuring , providing a catalyst for private capital flows , economic and technical co-operation , electronic commerce and ways to strengthen human resource development , economic infrastructure and the science and technological base .  
" We are a model of sound economic management , with a free market operating under the rule of law , a well-regulated financial sector and a clean government that exercises prudence in its fiscal policies .  
In addition , we are also committed to work closely with the market regulators including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the SFC to maintain a proper and modern regulatory regime in Hong Kong , and through them with overseas regulators on the promotion of international co-operation and best international practices on regulation of financial markets .  
" Hong Kong is a commercial and financial centre with distinctive architectural landmarks of high professional standard , " he said .  " The Bank of China Tower , the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Building , and the Convention and Exhibition Centre are superb landmarks on the Hong Kong skyline , indicative of the vibrancy and the attractiveness of this city , " Dr Leung said , " These are balanced by buildings with historical significance , such as the Western Market and the Flagstaff House Museum of Tea Ware , "  
These include a well developed financial infrastructure , a conducive regulatory environment and sound supervisory process , free and open markets , a modern and effective legal system and a high degree of transparency .  
Miss Chan said a few underlying principles must be observed in considering the four options .  They are : ( 1 ) the aim to save jobs and improve unemployment ; ( 2 ) the need to ensure employees ' statutory entitlements are not impaired ; ( 3 ) that the PWIF must stay financially sound at all times and ( 4 ) that no public funds should be used to finance the PWIF should it run into financial difficulties as a result of payment made to employees in cases of corporate rescue .  
The spokesman explained that the distinct narrowing in the visible trade deficit in 1998 reflected the adjustment in domestic demand upon the impact of the regional financial turmoil , which led to a marked decline in imports retained for local use .  
While Hong Kong has not been immune from the severe impact of the regional financial turmoil , with our sound economic fundamentals and robust financial and fiscal systems , we should be able to recover speedily when the global and regional situation improves . 
A stable and efficient debt market provides an effective avenue for Governments and enterprises to raise capital .  It is critical to the steady development of the financial industries as well as to the overall stability of the regional economies .  
( a ) whether , apart from giving hearing tests to all Primary One students at present , it provides such tests for primary and secondary school students in the regular medical examination conducted every year ; if it does , what the sense of hearing of students in Hong Kong is , as indicated in the results of those hearing tests in the past three years ; if not , the reasons for not providing such tests and whether they are related to administrative , technical and financial difficulties ; and  
A spokesman for the Health and Welfare Bureau said these guardians would make important decisions affecting the daily life of mentally incapacitated persons , such as deciding where they should live , controlling their financial affairs , as well as giving consent on their behalf for medical and dental treatment .  
The IMF also commended the Government 's consistent record of fiscal prudence , observing that the accumulation of substantial fiscal reserves had played an important role in sustaining confidence in financial markets , and had significantly increased the Government 's room for manoeuvre in the current economic downturn .  
Directors commended the Hong Kong SARG 's consistent record of fiscal prudence , observing that the accumulation of substantial fiscal reserves had played an important role in sustaining confidence in financial markets , and had significantly increased the Hong Kong SARG 's room for maneuver in the current economic downturn .  
Turning to social welfare , Mrs Fok said the $ 29.1 billion recurrent expenditure for 1999 / 2000 represented 14.1 per cent of the total Government recurrent expenditure and a real growth of 13.6 per cent over the figure for the current financial year .  
The Government has already allocated a very substantial proportion of public funds to the welfare sector on an annual basis , in terms of capital and recurrent resources .  In the financial year 1999 / 2000 , the subvention for direct services will rise to $ 6.2 billion from $ 5.4 billion .  
Three categories of prospective tenants are eligible for the new scheme : Waiting List ( WL ) applicants who are due for flat allocation in the coming financial year ; Temporary Housing / Cottage Areas and squatter clearees who have satisfied prevailing PRH eligibility criteria ; and junior civil servants under the Civil Service Public Housing Quota and Estate Assistants of the Housing Department due for allocation in the coming year .  
Their governing bodies and executive management are responsible for maintaining the financial well-being of their respective entities , including keeping the capital costs of projects under construction under tight control , lowering the operating costs of completed projects where justified , and revising the annual business plans as necessary in order to achieve the target rate of return over a period of time .  
integrated radio systems for mobile phone and paging services ; broadband ATM switch , mini telephone exchange and satellite transmission equipment ; a full range of telecommunications services , i.e . data , voice , Internet , satellite , etc . ; access to financial data and information databases ; centralised uninterrupted power supply for small businesses ; and backup generators for essential applications .  
For example , Article 109 provides that the HKSAR government shall maintain the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre .  Article 110 provides that the HKSAR government shall , on its own , formulate monetary and financial policies .  Article 111 prescribes that the Hong Kong dollar , as the legal tender in the HKSAR , shall continue to circulate .  Article 112 states that no foreign exchange control policies shall be applied in the HKSAR and that the Hong Kong dollar shall be freely convertible .  
Article 113 stipulates that the Exchange Fund of the HKSAR shall be managed and controlled by the government of the HKSAR . It is unusual to have such detailed specifications in a constitutional law , but the transfer of sovereignty is a significant change and it is helpful to retain those effective features that contribute to Hong Kong 's success as an international financial centre in the form of constitutional law .  
When raising funds in Hong Kong , mainland entities are treated as other international and local market participants .  Mainland companies listed in Hong Kong are required to abide by security laws of Hong Kong and are regulated by the relevant regulatory authorities in Hong Kong . Disputes relating to financial transactions are handled in accordance with international practice .  Where China 's Arbitration Law and other relevant laws and regulations are applicable according to the terms of a contract , the provisions relating to arbitration involving foreign parties are applied .  
During this period we encountered the severest financial crisis in many years , sustaining the great pain brought on by the economic adjustments .  Nevertheless we are also pleased that with the smooth implementation of the Basic Law , the " one country , two systems " principle has gained recognition not only from the local public , but also the international community and overseas investors .  
The long term financial sustainability of the current system is highly questionable , having regard to the aging population , the increased costs associated with adoption of new technology and the rising public expectation for quality services . 
While your visit on this occasion is all too short , I hope that in the brief time available you can get an appreciation of what Hong Kong is today - a city that 's proud to be reunited with China , a city confidently moving ahead to overcome the fallout from the Asian financial turmoil , and a hard-working people , like the Dutch , who have fashioned a dynamic environment which successfully blends the cultures of the east and the west . 
By early 2000 , the first set of complete annual BoP account with detailed components for both the current account and the capital and financial account will be available for the reference year of 1998 .  A quarterly series will also be produced .  
Hong Kong 's economic fundamentals remain strong .  These include , inter alia , the Mainland as our economic hinterland , robust financial and banking systems , a huge foreign exchange reserve , a sound legal system , a simple tax system with low tax rates , a clean government and efficient transport and communications facilities .  All these factors contribute towards the maintenance of our competitiveness .  
Under the proposal , Lloyd 's will be subject to the regulatory requirements applicable to other authorised insurers , including requirements with respect to solvency margin , local assets , fit and proper management , financial reporting and regulation of its insurance agents , with suitable modifications in recognition of its unique mode of operation and accounting system . 
Two years ago , gloomy scenarios were being painted - not about an Asian financial crisis - but about the impending demise of Hong Kong 's monetary autonomy under Chinese rule : about the breaking of the link between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S . dollar , the absorption of Hong Kong 's substantial foreign reserves by the Mainland , and so on .  
The practical and theoretical considerations involved in deciding on an appropriate exchange rate system can be reduced to four broad factors : the external versus domestic orientation of the economy ; the flexibility of its cost-price structure ; the exposure to financial shocks ; and the reputation and credibility of policy makers .  
There is a school of thought that maintains that mobile international capital can play a useful global role as a sort of ' policeman ' of sound policies .  The theory is that , in a liberalised global financial system , international capital flows reward countries with sound economic policies and punish those which pursue unbalanced and inconsistent policies .  
At the Financial Conference on Asia organised by the Trade Development Council today ( Thursday ) , Secretary for Financial Services , Mr Rafael Hui , in his speech entitled " What follows the Financial Turmoil " , warned that history would repeat itself without the joint effort of the international community in reforming the global financial architecture , and formulating new rules and strategies to cope with the massive and volatile capital flows in our globalised economy .  
The Government also reaffirmed the plan to consolidate the existing 12 pieces of securities-related legislation into one , with the intention to provide a more transparent and coherent regulatory framework and more effective regulation in an increasingly sophisticated and fast changing financial market .  
The rapid development of Bahrain 's financial industry is largely attributed to its favourable business environment .  It has a stable legal administrative framework and sophisticated financial and physical infrastructure .  
" The proposed framework covers different essential elements including effective financial crisis management , prudent risk management , proper corporate governance to strike a right balance between its commercial interest and the wider public interest , general regulation that ensures NewCo operates appropriately and prudently , and shareholding limit to ensure a truly diversified ownership , " the spokesman said .  
She emphasised that the progress of the financial services sector in Hong Kong in dealing with the Y2K problem had been satisfactory .  To date , all supervised financial institutions , such as banks , finance companies , exchanges members and insurance companies , have already reported to their respective regulators that they have completed rectification work of all their mission-critical systems , including testing of individual systems and the interfaces between the systems .  
Volatile capital flows and defects in the international financial architecture have been an important component of the crisis , but it is clear enough from the summary I have given that many of the problems are closer to home and institutional in nature : lending excesses , poor risk management , political interference , weak supervision , lack of transparency , and so on .  
No matter what forms of international monitoring and regulation might arise out of the discussions that are currently in progress , domestic financial systems will remain the basic building blocks of the international financial system for the foreseeable future , particularly in a region as politically and economically diverse as Asia . 
In Hong Kong we were fortunate to have in place prior to the Asian financial crisis a sound regulatory infrastructure , strong and well capitalised banks , disclosure standards comparable to the best in the world , and effective liquidation laws .  
Speaking at a passing-out parade at the Police Training School today ( Saturday ) , Mr Chau said good social order , a stable investment environment , an independent judiciary and rigorous enforcement by law enforcement agencies were indispensable for Hong Kong to maintain its status as an industrial and business centre , a financial centre as well as a cosmopolitan city .  
" Hong Kong needs to have a modern and flexible regulatory framework to strengthen our competitive edge amidst rapid changes in the international financial markets , " Mr Rafael S Y Hui , the acting Financial Secretary said , " A reform to our existing legislation governing the securities and futures markets is urgently needed . "  
He also considered that the most productive focus for international and national economic reforms lay in the four key areas of strengthening financial markets , reducing vulnerability to short term capital flows , promoting greater transparency at all levels , and involving private creditors in debt resolution arrangements .  
In his opening remarks , Mr Joseph Yam , Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said : " The crises over the past two years have taught us that , no matter how well maintained the domestic financial environment may be , serious problems persist in what has proved to be an increasingly volatile international financial system .  These problems can not be resolved by individual economies on their own .  
The Government remains firmly committed to maintaining the rule of law , efficient public administration , prudent fiscal policy , simple tax system with low tax rate , sound financial system , first-class infrastructure and sophisticated support services , so as to preserve and wherever possible lift further Hong Kong 's competitive position in the world .  
It allows us complete financial autonomy , and independence of our monetary system .  It establishes the Hong Kong SAR as a separate customs territory , and enables us to work directly with the international community to curb trade in strategic commodities , drugs , illegal transshipments , and infringement of intellectual property rights .  
Both exchanges ' ruling bodies believe that the market reform as proposed by the Financial Secretary of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is vital to the future development of Hong Kong 's financial services industry and that it will be critical to maintain and strengthen further Hong Kong 's position as a global financial centre in the increasingly competitive international securities and derivatives market .  
As Loco-London gold trading are not subject to any financial regulatory regime , the companies are not obliged to keep proper audit trail .  Moreover , the victims signed their contracts without the presence of independent witnesses allowing the companies to easily negate liability from the victims ' losses and make prosecutions more difficult .  
Topics covered during the 75-minute ABAC session included lessons from the Asian financial crisis , sustainable economic growth , accelerated trade liberalisation , APEC 's contribution to the WTO , the development of a policy framework to cope with a competitive global economy , the abolition of subsidies on food products within APEC and Y2K readiness .  
Maintaining monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong , continuing to improve the regulatory framework , improving the infrastructure required for a first class international financial centre and spearheading the further development of the financial markets are targets that we are committed to achieve .  
The spokesman appealed to the SSA staff to follow the civil service team to uphold their duties and responsibilities under limited resources in the benefit of the general public , especially the social security recipients were mostly the elderly , the disabled and those in need of urgent financial assistance .  
He also pointed out four challenges that the new millennium would bring to the financial market : the advance of information technology and the proliferation of internet applications ; the growing importance of institutional investors that caused fundamental changes to many aspects of the capital market ; the growing demand for cross-border financial transactions that has raised challenges for market regulators everywhere ; the emergence of a globalised market place that are linked by ever-expanding telecommunications technology which led to ever-growing cross-border financing activities .  
Financial liberalisation became very much the fashion , leading to domestic financial markets rapidly attaining a global dimension , welcoming and absorbing international capital .  
Mr Yam identified the areas to be considered for the building of a stronger financial system as : prudent management of the international financial architecture , international reform in financial disclosure and regulation , and regional monetary co-operation .  
" The Advisers believe that Hong Kong is well placed to capitalise on its position as a global financial centre , given our strengths , quality physical infrastructure , resourcefulness of human capital and unique economic links with the Mainland , " he said . 
The interest rate trend in the United States and the ensuing implications for its stock market and overall demand warrant close monitoring .  The economic recovery in Japan is yet to become more entrenched .  The process of financial reform and corporate restructuring in many of the crisis-hit East Asian economies will have to continue in order to sustain their growth in the time ahead .

Although there is a premium for doing business in Hong Kong , as with New York or London , he said the premium here was justified by our advantages : our location , world-class banking , financial services and infrastructure ; free market philosophy ; strong legal system based on the common law ; highly-developed services culture and economy which ranges across the whole services spectrum etc .  
With our unique attributes , including an internationally oriented financial and commercial system , a sound legal system and first-class air and cargo facilities , the Hong Kong business sector should continue to have an active role to play in the process of cross-strait market liberalization , provided that it can continue to adjust and adapt itself in providing high quality and high value-added services with a view to capitalizing on the business opportunities available .  
Other factors found favourable by an overwhelming majority ( i.e . 85% or more ) of respondents are : banking and financial facilities , tax regime , infrastructure , cleanliness of government , availability of managerial skill , geographical location , availability of professional / technical skill and adequacy of supporting services .  
( ii ) the total number of civil proceedings for damages instituted by members of the public who suffered financial losses as a result of negligence or fraudulent acts on the part of practising solicitors , and the number of cases in which the court ruled in favour of the plaintiffs , as well as the average amount of damages awarded ; and  
The Government has two objectives in introducing the Bill : one is to enhance the transparency of the insurance market in Hong Kong by allowing the Insurance Authority to disclose financial and statistical information of individual insurers when it is in the interests of the insuring public to do so ; the other is to cater for the needs of overseas insurers by empowering the Insurance Authority to accept actuarial standards which are comparable to those prescribed by legislation for compliance by the appointed actuaries of long-term business insurers .  
I am confident that with an active financial market , a thriving tourist industry , enhanced foreign trade , the gathering momentum of technological developments as well as the momentous development of China 's forthcoming accession to the World Trade Organisation , we can be cautiously optimistic about the medium and long-term economic prospects of Hong Kong .  
" Apart from the obvious social benefits , the MPF system will have a significant impact on stimulating economic growth .  And Hong Kong 's status as a premier international financial centre will receive a great shot in the arm , " Mr . Lee concluded .  
In the past three financial years as well as the current one ( four financial years ) , the total expenditure of the Government , the former provisional municipal councils and the Housing Authority on public works is about $ 188 billion , i.e . $ 47 billion per year on average .  
In the race into the knowledge economy , Mr Tung expected that the middle class would benefit most relative to the rest as knowledge , brain power , or innovative human capital , was worth more than physical or financial capital in a knowledge economy . 
Given the increasingly volatile and potentially destabilising nature of international capital flows , as was clearly demonstrated during the Asian financial crisis , the very substantial foreign reserves held by the Exchange Fund provided the foundation which enabled us to fend off very severe speculative attacks and retain public confidence on Hong Kong 's monetary and financial systems .  
Mr Wong noted that the Government would allocate an additional $ 1.24 billion in the coming financial year for the new initiatives on education and manpower , of which $ 300 million would be spent on promoting employment and encouraging continuing education , $ 140 million to help needy students and $ 800 million for implementing the education reform .  
As compared with the current financial year , the total education expenditure represents an increase of 4.1 per cent in nominal terms and four per cent in real terms .  Of the $ 54.4 billion , $ 36.1 billion ( 66.4 per cent ) will be on basic education , $ 18.3 billion ( 33.6 per cent ) be on tertiary education .  
This is particularly relevant to Hong Kong as an international financial centre where non-domestic financial business and movements in portfolio capital unrelated to economic developments intrinsic to Hong Kong are abundant .  
Commenting on the operating results of the Exchange Fund for 1999 , the Chief Executive of the HKMA , Mr Joseph Yam , said that the 20% increase in accumulated surplus was encouraging , particularly in a very difficult year when rising interest rates resulted in volatile financial conditions .  
We took decisive and resolute measures .  With the perseverance of the entire community , our financial market has retained stability and maintained steady development .  The economy has moved out of recession and has resumed a steady growth path .  
" Good social order , a stable investment environment , an independent judiciary and rigorous enforcement of the laws by law enforcement agencies are indispensable for Hong Kong to maintain its status as a leading business and trade centre , a world-class financial centre as well as a cosmopolitan city . "  
Mrs Chu said : " The victims of domestic violence need a comprehensive range of support services , such as clinical psychological services , housing arrangement , legal assistance , financial assistance , job placement and medical services , to help them overcome trauma and resume normal functioning . "  " Thus , the ' one-stop ' service approach is to ensure that the victims and their family members will get what they need as soon as possible through strengthening coordination with other government departments , non-governmental organisations and related professionals . "  
This was considerably larger than the net non-reserve financial outflow of $ 2.7 billion in the first quarter , possibly due to an increase in direct investment outflow as the regional economic environment progressively improved .  
The positive BoP position was mainly underpinned by the improvement in the current account , as Hong Kong 's exports strengthened while imports were restrained .  This reflected the adjustment process continuing in the economy to restore external balance after the Asian financial turmoil .  
" Local professional bodies , regulatory institutions and the government will monitor the development of the markets and take necessary measures to keep our regulatory regime up to date and abreast with the global trend .  Above all , we will strike a proper balance between the protection of the rights of investors and assistance rendered to the emerging enterprises so as to ensure that our financial industries will continue to flourish in the new economy , " she stressed .  
" It has been the government 's established policy to ensure an efficient and orderly operation of the financial market and the financial services sector , to provide an open and fair business environment which is favourable for market development , and to maintain and enhance Hong Kong 's status as a major international financial centre .  
But as markets attained a global dimension , encouraged by financial liberalisation and the advance of information technology , they became far less tolerant of weaknesses than before , and the markets responded to weaknesses with harsh punishments , which many considered grossly unfair . 
This is examining the environmental , engineering , financial and operational aspects of alternative plans for the sewage system serving the main urban areas in order to make recommendations on the most sustainable way forward .  
Recommending this newsletter to members of the public and the insurance sector , the Commissioner of Insurance , Mr Benjamin Tang , today ( May 21 ) said : " Insurance plays a vital role in Hong Kong 's daily life .  It provides protection against unexpected financial losses , facilitates trade , supplements public social benefits and mobilises savings . "  " To facilitate development of the insurance industry , a sound regulatory framework must be in place to ensure the financial health and integrity of the insurance market .  
In the foreword of the Hong Kong Police Review 1999 , which was published today ( May 21 ) , Mr Hui noted that the continuing climate of economic uncertainty and social hardship resulting from the Asian financial crisis had an inevitable effect on both the number and types of crimes committed , with continued evidence of increased crime related to the downturn in the economy , including cases of criminal intimidation related to debt-collecting malpractices and quick-cash crimes such as pick-pocketing and snatching . 
The Insurance Companies ( Amendment ) Bill 2000 serves two purposes : one is to enhance the transparency of the insurance market in Hong Kong by allowing the Insurance Authority ( IA ) to disclose financial and statistical information of individual insurers when it is in the interests of the insuring public to do so ; the other is to cater for the needs of overseas insurers by empowering the IA to accept actuarial standards which are comparable to those prescribed by legislation for compliance by the appointed actuaries of long term business insurers .  
( a ) the situation will arise in which the fiscal reserves deposited by the Government in the Exchange Fund will be frozen and can not be withdrawn in order to pay for public expenditure , when a substantial amount of the assets of the Exchange Fund has been utilised for stabilizing the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong ;  
These changes included strengthening the monetary system to provide a greater buffer against attacks on the currency ; strengthening the banking system ; improving market regulations and stimulating the merger and demutualisation of the stock and futures exchanges ; closing loopholes in legislation ; and making the financial system far more open and transparent .  
Within the total factor income outflow , DII rebounded to a significant increase of 49.7% in 1999 , reflecting a distinct pick-up in earnings from direct investment in Hong Kong , particularly by those companies engaged in banking and other financial businesses , as the local economic situation improved .  
( a ) given that the Special Finance Scheme for Small and Medium Enterprises ( SFS ) has stopped accepting new applications since April 8 , 2000 , when the processing of the outstanding applications for credit guarantees under the SFS is expected to be completed ; and whether it has assessed if it is easier now than during the period when the SFS was in place for SMEs to secure loans from financial institutions ; if it has , of the relevant details ; if not , whether such an assessment will be made ; and  
Apart from the distinct improvement in the current account surplus in the second half of 1999 upon the sharp rebound in exports of both goods and services , the turnaround in financial flows back to a net inflow towards the year-end also contributed to the marked rise in BoP surplus in the fourth quarter .  
Hong Kong has long been the international maritime capital of Asia . Not only is its excellent location supported by world-class communications , transport and financial services , but coupled with an enormous pool of experienced professionals in shipping affairs , Hong Kong is the ideal place for settling arbitration disputes .  
Some 15% of the Government expenditure are spent on social welfare , ranging from financial assistance for the needy to a full range of welfare services for the aged , the disabled and other vulnerable groups . 
We have worked hard since then to realise this goal .  This has included drafting and enacting new legislation ; selecting a strong team of financial institutions to prepare , manage and underwrite the Share Offer ; and developing a comprehensive advertising campaign , which starts tomorrow .  You have probably noticed some of the material already ; and we will preview the rest shortly .  
Within the total factor income outflow , DII surged by 91.6% in the first quarter of 2000 over a year earlier .  This reflected a distinct pick-up in earnings from direct investment in Hong Kong , particularly by those engaged in financial business , as the recovery of the local economy became more entrenched .  
The net outflow of financial non-reserve assets in the first quarter of 2000 was characterised by a net outflow in direct investment due to increased investment by Hong Kong residents abroad , a shift to net outflow due to cash settlement of financial derivatives , and a continued though reduced net outflow in other investment , but a continued huge net inflow in portfolio investment .  
Against the continued sizeable surplus in the current account , this reversal in BoP position was mostly due to a switch to net outflow in financial non-reserve assets in the first quarter of this year , having recorded a huge net inflow in the preceding quarter .  
In turn , this was caused by the highly volatile movements in net cash settlement of financial derivatives , together with increase in direct investment abroad upon the improved regional economic environment .  
We are committed to maintaining monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong ; improving the regulatory framework ; and enhancing the infrastructure required for an international financial centre and providing an appropriate environment for an open , fair and efficient market ; and spearheading the further development of the financial markets .  
" Hong Kong is experienced in international capital financing and able to provide a wide variety of financial services .  Our efficient market and monitoring mechanism as well as prudent banking sector can provide effective capital financing services to the western region .  
Hong Kong 's market mechanism is well aligned with the world system .  The regulation of financial businesses such as banking , insurance and securities is efficient .  Professional services such as legal services , accounting and consultancy are well established .  The external networking such as trade , communication and transportation is also properly set up .  
A Government spokesman said : " We are pleased to note JCRA 's recognition of Hong Kong 's strong economic recovery , extensive external reserves and solid fiscal position , high standard in financial market regulation and successful reforms of our financial and monetary regimes . "  
JCRA 's upgrade was based on Hong Kong 's recovery from the economic recession , the extensive external reserves and solid fiscal position that were not impaired by the financial crisis , and the reforms that had strengthened the currency board arrangements and enhanced the Government 's ability to fend off speculative pressure .  
He added that Hong Kong 's strong economic fundamentals were supported by its prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , sound financial regulatory systems and stable economic development of the Mainland .  
Mr Tung said APEC Leaders had resolved to continue working in international forums to help shape the global economy and to provide a more secure and stable financial environment for developed and developing countries .  
He added that Hong Kong 's traditional strengths have contributed to the positive outlook of our e-business development .  These include an excellent business environment , world-renowned physical infrastructure such as the port and the airport , an open market economy , free flow of information , freedom of speech ; the rule of law ; and Hong Kong 's position as a world class international financial centre and Asia 's largest venture capital centre .  
The main objective of the Bill is to set up an effective regulatory regime for the development of a fair , orderly and transparent market to promote market confidence , secure appropriate investor protection , reduce market malpractice and financial crimes , and facilitate innovation and competition .  
The Banking ( Amendment ) Bill 2000 seeks to strengthen the regulatory functions of the MA corresponding to the introduction of the regulatory regime by the SF Bill , to ensure that regulation of the securities business of exempt AIs is carried out in a more effective and fair manner .  This will be conducive to enhancing Hong Kong 's status as an international financial centre .  I hope that Members will support the Bill .  
While the current account continued to record a large surplus upon the export boom and the net inflow of external factor income , the financial non-reserve assets also switched back to a net inflow in the second quarter , mostly due to a substantial inflow of direct investment into Hong Kong but also upon a continued net inflow of portfolio investment fund .  
There are four major reasons underlying the late payment of rates - - new owners have not received rates demands in the immediate period following the change of ownership of premises ; owners fail to make prompt arrangements with tenants for rates payment after the properties have been let ; payers claiming that they have not received rates demands or payers have forgotten to pay rates before the due date ; or payers have been unable to settle the payment due to financial difficulties .  
" We shall ensure that the public fees will always be set at a level that is affordable by individual patients and there will always be a safety net to enable the financial vulnerable to continue to have equal access to quality medical care .  
Because the severely disabled and the elderly infirm were considered to have extra needs , the original objectives of the scheme were to give some financial help to the families concerned and to reduce demand for institutional care for these two groups .  
A Government secretariat spokesman pointed out that Hong Kong 's overall external payments position remained favourable in the third quarter of 2000 , marked by a further increase in the current account surplus and continued net inflow of financial non-reserve assets .  
The committee , if set up , will be responsible for drawing up recommendations on how the existing rent fixing and review mechanism , where the median rent-to-income ratio ( MRIR ) is used as benchmark in assessing tenants ' affordability , may be improved having regard to all relevant legal , financial and policy considerations .  
For the purpose of comparison , the paper focused in particular on the recent financial crisis in Argentina , which , like Hong Kong , operated a currency board system .  The paper noted that the crisis in Argentina was induced more by public finance problems ( such as extensive external debt and a weak fiscal position ) than by any weakness in the monetary system .  
To provide more efficient services to the business community and reinforce Hong Kong 's status as an international financial center , the Companies Registry will implement a Strategic Change Plan ( SCP ) to switch into paperless electronic operation and will be committed to bring forward the reviews on company law and corporate governance .  
( a ) of the respective numbers of organizations which applied to the AIDS Council for funding and whose applications were approved in each of the past five financial years , together with detailed information about the organizations subsidized under the three categories of funding application , namely " ex-gratia payments " , " medical and support services " and " publicity and public education " , including the name of each organization and the amount of funds obtained ; 
He added that HK 's strong economic fundamentals were supported by its prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , sound financial regulatory systems and stable economic development of the Mainland .  
He emphasised that , in achieving the elusive twin goals of financial and monetary stability , mutually reinforcing anchors as well as an enhanced appreciation of the interdependence of policies in the two areas would be required , regardless of the formal institutional division of responsibility .  
Whilst waiting for the research findings , the three sub-committees are now examining specific governance topics in earnest .  Some examples of the subjects being considered include the need for a statutory statement of duties for directors ; shareholder remedies ; standards of corporate disclosure ; and filing of financial statements by private companies .  
The Committee emphasised that interim measures were needed to enable employers , in particular multinational financial corporations , to recruit the employees that meet their corporate needs without having to resort to overseas talent or by moving their operations to alternative centres where suitable human resources were available .  
He added that Hong Kong 's strong economic fundamentals , prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , and sound financial regulatory systems merit higher ratings for Hong Kong .  
" The pre-qualification exercise will ensure that all applicants will meet a minimum standard of investment , network rollout and financial capability while spectrum auction is an allocation process that is efficient , fair and transparent , " he stressed .  
( a ) in order to reduce the operating costs of SMEs , expeditiously and suitably relaxing the restrictions on the use of industrial premises , encouraging further introduction of internationally recognized quality certification services in the market , providing greater financial support in such areas as manpower training , marketing and the application of information technology , encouraging franchised companies to lower their fees and charges and to engage in healthy competition , as well as striving to maintain a simple tax system ;  
Looking ahead , we will concentrate in the new financial year on implementing a programme to provide financial assistance for retrofitting 50,000 pre-Euro heavy diesel vehicles with suitable catalytic converters , mapping out a way forward for replacing diesel light buses with alternative fuel models and drawing up codes of practice in conjunction with the relevant parties on controlling idling engines .  
According to the terms of reference , the committee will review the current domestic rent policy , having regard to the evolving profile of both tenants and rental housing stock under the HA . The committee will take into account the need to reflect tenants ' affordability while ensuring public housing subsidy is given in relation to need , the existing legislative provisions of having a 10% cap on the median rent-to-income ratio ( MRIR ) after rent adjustment , and the financial performance of the Authority 's rental business .  
I am pleased to know that the Government 's initiatives to improve the elderly services are already bearing fruit .  Over the past three years and a half , we have made a good deal of efforts .  The provisions for elderly welfare services will be increased twofold from $ 1.6 billion in the financial year 1997-98 to $ 3.2 billion in the next financial year .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that Hong Kong 's external payments position remained favourable in the fourth quarter of 2000 , characterised by a continued surplus in the current account and a further net inflow of financial non-reserve assets , hence yielding an overall balance of payments surplus .  
This was underpinned by both a further distinct surplus in the current account and a significant net inflow of financial non-reserve assets , amidst the strong performance of Hong Kong 's external trade and the relative robustness of Hong Kong 's stock market in that year .  
The current financial problem faced by the ECAF could be attributed to a number of causes , the most important one being that there have recently been three major common law cases with damages exceeding $ 10 million .  Besides , as a result of a drop in employees ' compensation insurance premium , levy income has decreased in recent years .  
It has also made developing countries more vulnerable to the impact of external economic turmoil and financial crises , as evidenced by the grave impact of the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s on some Asian countries and regions . 
The financial system , in particular the banking system , is the foundation for economic growth , since a crippled financial sector will be unable to intermediate between savings and investments , thereby leading to prolonged liquidity crunch and inefficient allocation of resources . 
This process of change has been accelerated by the economic crisis in 1997 , which has spread to all parts of Asia .

We have a robust legal system , a level playing field , a stringent market regulatory system , a liberal foreign exchange regime , the free flow of information , a clean government , a sound financial position and a simple taxation system .

Its good legal , exchange rate , taxation and regulatory environments , coupled with its excellent professional services , have made it especially well suited for regional headquarters and regional offices .  In addition , Hong Kong will remain firm in its position as a financial centre .  
This will create huge room for development for Hong Kong 's enterprises .  With our many unique advantages , such as the rule of law , a low tax rate , a clean government , a solid financial system , the free flow of capital and information , and a wealth of knowledge about the Mainland and international markets , Hong Kong will be able to contribute to the further development of the Mainland and , in the process , find new impetus of growth for our own economy .  
He added : " Over the past years , we have accumulated extensive experience on business dealings with the Mainland . These hard earned advantages , together with our sound legal system , our advanced telecommunications and other infrastructure facilities , our small and efficient government , and our strength as an international financial centre with a freely convertible currency , should enable Hong Kong companies to secure a significant share of the liberalised trade following China 's WTO accession .

We are forging the bilateral linkage with Euroclear with a view to promoting cross-boundary custody and clearing of Hong Kong and overseas bonds , and at the same time expanding the base of investors , thereby stimulating the growth of both local and regional bond markets .  We will also develop our CMU into an international clearing house , so that Hong Kong will become the central clearing house in Asia . This will strengthen our status as an international financial centre .  
Ideally , the minimum relevant income level should be set at a level high enough to exclude those employees in the lower income bands from contributing so as to alleviate their financial hardship during times when economic conditions are poor .

Firstly , the CSSA scheme run by the Social Welfare Department covers the entire rent for the poorest households .

Households may also move to flats at lower rents or switch to interim housing to get out of the plight .

First , I forecast a consolidated deficit of $ 65.6 billion for 2001-02 ( equivalent to 5.2% of GDP ) , far larger than the original estimate of $ 3 billion .

Furthermore , the secondary offering of Mass Transit Railway shares originally planned for this financial year has been postponed to the next because of changes in investment market conditions .

" Hong Kong provides an independent judicial system based on English common law , a solid and transparent regulatory framework , a large and varied pool of qualified financial professionals , as well as free flow of capital and information .  These competitive edges make Hong Kong the most ideal place for business development for international investment banks and securities houses in the Greater China region , " said Mr Rowse .  
These factors included political stability and security , rule of law and an independent judiciary , corruption free government , infrastructure , press and information freedom , a sturdy banking and financial system and a low and simple tax regime .  
With the strong support of the Central Government and the joint efforts of Hong Kong people , we have successfully implemented " One Country , Two Systems " .  We have overcome the Asian financial crisis .  We have preserved social order , ensuring that Hong Kong maintains a politically and socially stable environment and a solid economic foundation that can rise to any challenges ahead .

Our economic and social institutions remain unchanged .  Our position as an international centre for trade and business , financial services and shipping industry has been maintained .  Hong Kong is recognised as one of the most dynamic cities in Asia and in the world .  
" We note JCRA 's recognition that Hong Kong enjoys strong external position , high level of fiscal flexibility , a resilient financial sector and a high level of autonomy in many aspects , including the financial and legal systems , and that HK 's role as an international financial centre has remained intact , " a Government spokesman said .

Indeed , we will strengthen our competitive advantages as an international financial centre , a key transport and logistic hub , a vibrant economic and trading centre as well as a popular tourism destination .  
In order to ensure our separate way of life , our legal , financial and other systems remained unchanged after reunification , it was written into the Basic Law that it would be left to us , the people of Hong Kong , to draw up our own laws to safeguard national security , sovereignty , territorial integrity and unity .  
Regarding the details of the proposal , Mr Lam said in respect of GC and FC elections , the candidates who got elected or had received 5 % of valid votes or more would be given financial support .  The rate would be set at $ 10 per vote but capped at 50% of the actual declared election expenses of the candidate concerned .  
The current deficit is serious and is threatening to undermine our financial strength and market confidence .  If the problem is not solved as soon as possible , Hong Kong risks being exposed to heightened speculation , which may trigger outflows of capital , rising interest rates , turmoil in the financial markets leading ultimately to possible attacks on our linked exchange rate system .  
Four years from now , we expect the Mainland to have become more fully aligned with the rest of the world in trade and economic matters .  We must seize these opportunities to elevate Hong Kong from its traditional role as an intermediary to a major hub connecting the Mainland and the international markets .  We can do this by supporting the Mainland 's economic development and opening up of its economy .  At the same time , we will enhance our position as the financial and commercial centre of China .  
Leaders of the Central Government and Guangdong Province as well as the Chief Executive of Macau fully support the development of the PRD , including Macau , into a major modernised economic region through enhancing co-operation with Hong Kong . The region will be a production and manufacturing base , a centre of modern services such as logistics , professional and financial services , tourism and entertainment , communication as well as consumer and personal services . 
These will include raising and speeding up the level of co-operation to realise our common goal of achieving a major modernised economic region , enhancing our co-ordination in regional infrastructure projects , strengthening our world-class logistics services , developing the western part of the PRD , and fully expanding our services industries .  There is scope to explore new areas of co-operation in the financial sector , in improving market regulation and in education .  
We still have the hardware and software required of a world-class city , including our keen business acumen , a well-developed infrastructure , a versatile financial system , robust legal institutions , policies conducive to a free and open society , a clean and efficient civil service , simple and low taxation , a large pool of talent and a cosmopolitan community .  
It will not only be a manufacturing base with new technology inputs , but also a principal provider of modern services to China and the Asia-Pacific .

We also encourage SMEs to participate in Government tenders by enhancing the provision of information about our IT projects to the market and by reducing the financial burden on potential tenderers ( for example , lowering or removing the tender and contract deposit requirement , and only requiring a performance bond or bank guarantee from a successful tenderer for high-value or complex project contracts if , during financial vetting , the tenderer is unable to supply adequate supporting information about its financial capability to perform its contractual obligations ) .  
Specifically , we will review our social security schemes to ensure a basic safety net for needy elders and people with disabilities , assist the unemployed and the needy to tide over their short term financial difficulties , adopt more vigorous and rational gate-keeping for access to services based on defined need , and re-engineer services to strengthen integration and networking .  
As the number of families and individuals requiring financial support by the Government is bound to increase given the current economic situation and high unemployment , the adjustment will enable us to ensure that the safety net can be maintained within our means and that existing resources go further to meet the increasing demand . 
It is essential for us to look far ahead to find feasible and practical ways to develop a sustainable financial support system for the needy elderly .  
We believe that a more effective way to address the problem of deflation without increasing our financial burden is to increase external demand , which means attracting more visitors , overseas talent and investment immigrants to come to Hong Kong ; more foreign enterprises to set up regional offices here ; more people to attend schools in Hong Kong and seek medical treatment at our private hospitals ; and more foreign capital inflows into Hong Kong 's financial market .  
At present , the Social Welfare Department ( SWD ) provides residential services for people with disabilities and the elderly primarily through financial subventions to non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) .  Amongst these residential services , Long Stay Care Homes are for mentally ill patients with long-term residual disabilities whilst Hostels for Mentally Handicapped Persons are for people with varying degrees of mental handicap .  Residential services for elders suffering from poor health or physical / mental weaknesses are provided in Care and Attention Homes ( including those for the Aged Blind ) and Nursing Homes .  
Within the total factor income outflow , DII outflow rose by 8.6% in the fourth quarter of 2002 over a year earlier , largely owing to increased earnings from investment in the local financial sector by some prominent multinational enterprises .

The same statutory requirements will be imposed on all pre-Euro heavy diesel vehicles upon completion of the current programme to provide financial assistance for retrofitting of catalytic converters next year .  
In conclusion , despite the financial stringency faced by the Government and the Housing Authority , I am confident that we can make use of our limited resources to implement the three main pillars of our housing policy , namely , helping low-income families gain access to affordable housing , minimising intervention in the market and maintaining a fair and stable operating environment for the healthy development of the private property market .

A : The Executive Yuan has always seen the improvement of military , public servant , and teacher salaries as an issue of importance , and adjustment will be made in fiscal 1988 . The rate of adjustment will be matched by the Executive Yuan with the total calculated budget for fiscal 1988 .

Thereafter , enticed by financial inducements or simply duped into going , millions of coolies accepted a modest payment and contracted to work for a limited period in tin mines or in the rubber , tea and sugar plantations of Southeast Asia . Others set off further afield to dig for guano in Peru , build railways in America , work in the gold mines of Australia and South Africa , or work behind the lines on the Great War battlefields of Europe .  
In order to ensure normal economic growth and release inflationary pressure , the Central Bank decided to adopt a policy of financial stringency as from March of this year and the money supply growth rate has steadily fallen from its original 30% ; another factor which caused there to be less cash in circulation in Taiwan was purchases of foreign currency by many people who anticipated that the NT dollar would depreciate .  
Failure to repay money borrowed from colleague and relatives is ruinous to personal relationships , and people have gone to ground to avoid their debts . Those with more savvy have managed to shift their own losses onto their firm , while others have been lucky in that their firm has accepted responsibility for their own debt - - securities firms are keen to maintain an immaculate record to qualify under the Ministry of Finance 's recent arrangements for the financial investment and securities industry .  
Koo Chen-fu , who has long been known as an " ambassador of trade " holds a similar view : " The main global economic organizations that we 're fighting to join at present now are GATT , which regulates the world 's free trading system ; the International Monetary Fund , which regulates the world 's financial system ; the World Bank , which assists in the development of developing countries ; and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , which is made up of the world 's leading industrialized countries . "  
" In fact the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar and high foreign exchange reserves are not directly or necessarily linked with speculative fever or inflation . What is important is looking at how policy in the financial markets is carried out and supporting their stability , " says Lu Fang-ching , deputyexecutive secretary of the Commodity Price Supervisory Board at the Ministry of Economic Affairs examining the problem from another angle . " The point is that the central bank , compared to five years ago , is more experienced and very cautious . "  
Insufficient financial and human resources are the reason why handicapped athletics has never been popularized in this country , " says Ho Mao-sung . The CPAA was established seven years ago , but it only has made annual expenditures of NT $ 100,000 ( NT $ 200,000 this year ) , and the amount its volunteer director , secretary-general , and assistant secretary-general are able to accomplish is limited .  
The department found in 1990 that the rate of women aged 15 to 49 who lived with their parents or their husband 's parents within five years of being married increased 4.5 percent over 1988 . And the younger the woman and the lower her level of education ( meaning women with more financial difficulties ) , the more likely she was to live with one set of parents .  
From another point of view , of course these services may be satisfactory for a time . But in the so-called advanced countries , including Britain , the US , Japan , and Australia , because the governments , banks , businesses , and individuals have all been encouraging each other to expand credit ( loan volume ) and have been consuming intensively , this has led to an exhaustion of financial capacity . The defects which were revealed in the current period of economic recession can not but make one sit up and take warning .  
Moreover , Hong Kong has become an international free port in the last twenty years and a financial center . Apart from its explosion of wealth , it has also been very hard to resist the temptations of the flow of imported luxuries from all over the world . Thus , generally speaking , most Hong Kong people like to boast about what they love to enjoy ; enjoyment ( usually material ) has become a very important social value .  
It is said that when some companies have formed alliances with foreign enterprises , even the plans produced by the partners have been so hard to get to grips with that the contract documents are just left to drafted by the opposite parties before they are signed . The result is that , if later on it is discovered that the technological exchange or financial conditions have not been met as planned , then it is too late to escape .  
The KMT 's election broadcasts featured replays of old newsreels showing the DPP 's past street demonstrations and laid the charge against them of engaging in riotous politics . The DPP raised the KMT 's financial scandals to criticize them on counts of corruption and senility . The China Social Democratic Party 's 9-minute broadcast on the theme of growing up accused both parties of pointless fighting and asked where the people are who are going to plant seeds when " the robbers have all got their places . "  
He saw that Taiwan might be an excellent market , so he brought along masters of all of a funeral 's " affiliated industries , " including monks , Taoist priests , carpenters and wood carvers , painters , and makers of incense and of symbolic gold and silver paper money . He gave each of them a substantial payment to insure financial security for their families , and then - - more than 100 strong - - they imposingly crossed the sea to Taiwan to open a new world .  
As well as this , in recent years Taiwan 's financial strength has grown and the New Taiwan Dollar has appreciated significantly . This has led the ITRI to begin introducing technology from abroad , becoming a technological bridge between foreign high technology and domestic businesses and shortening the length of time spent on research and development .  
Recalling that time when he was first struck by computerized printing , Lee seems a bit hesitant and unenthusiastic . " Everybody just cursed . " Still , in a panic that they might lose their jobs , as well as with various incentives like a newspaper sponsored computer entry competition and financial awards to encourage them , and relying on a unrelenting spirit , the vast majority gradually got familiar with the computer keyboard and learned the new typesetting technology .  
In recent years , land speculation , a dramatic rise in the price of housing , stock speculation , and a string of scandals involving major public works pro-jects and purchasing have sullied the R . O . C . ' s political and economic environment . Political factions and financial consortiums have pushed their interests close to the center of power in the ruling party . These have laid the seeds of the people 's discontent . Everywhere one sees petitions for reform .  
The end of Autumn Chrysanthemum is a happy scene of great coming together amidst the conflict between different ethnic groups . The children from the military dependents villages used the fraternal method of financial gifts and peace mediation ( in Wu Chin-fa 's eyes , the children from the military dependents villages had the most resources in those years ) , to smooth over the conflicts between Fukienese-Taiwanese and Hakka-Taiwanese factions , and resolve a scene of bloody conflict .  
Thailand 's Prince Bhisatej once publicly explained at an international agricultural conference that the agricultural assistance from every country was limited to either financial aid or the appointment of chosen specialists to draft a research report . Only the Republic of China 's specialists came in person to northern Thailand to help the Thais grow vegetables and fruit . This proved to be of enormous benefit to the daily lives of the local inhabitants of this district .  
Right now the mainland economy is heated up , and the financial market has the jitters . Of course private companies ca n't compete with state-owned enterprises which have access to deep and extensive human relations networks , " Yang Donghong observes . If a state-owned establishment defaults on a loan , the loan officer holds little responsibility . But if a private business goes insolvent , the officer who sponsored the loan will almost certainly be unable to escape blame .  
What 's more , in 1993 a private financial consortium built the nearby Shin Kong Life Tower , a 53-story skyscraper that has already become a new symbol of the city . And the new 12-story KMT party headquarters is to be located by the East Gate directly across from the Presidential Palace . The Po Ai District is gradually being enclosed amid a concrete jungle of modern skyscrapers .  
When the various conflicts surrounding the health insurance system became a hot topic of discussion , most people probably overlooked one basic fact : The universal health care plan is actually only a financial design , and its goal is to eliminate " loss and waste " from the vast health care system . As for actual medical service , one still must look to the same health care network of medical centers and personnel that is already in place .  
After the universal health insurance was implemented , the medical referral system , buttressed by ample financial power , went into an experimental phase . But wave after wave of strong suspicion and opposition have been thrown up against the program . This has forced the NHIB to initiate the " transitional step " of simplifying the referral system from having four levels to only two , and doing away with extra fees for those who have no referral slips , until the population can become accustomed to the referral system .  
Whether they be from the financial sector or political parties , or are veteran broadcasters or members of the arts starting up their own private operations , the vast majority are interested in stations broadcasting to urban areas with a relatively wide range of listeners and high impact .  
But later his father suffered a stroke , and the family faced a difficult financial situation . The burden of supporting the household fell entirely on Chou Meng-te 's shoulders , and he had no choice but to leave his undemanding teaching job with its regular salary and find another way to earn a living .  
Because of administrative financial difficulties , their environmental conservation budget is limited . Many wildlife conservation activities are even limited to private lands . This has led to a reaction , in which many voices have arisen claiming that more human energy and material should be focused on protecting entire ecosystems and habitats .  
" The best situation would of course be cross-strait reconciliation , so that Taiwan could enter the middle phase of its national unification plan , and establish trade , transport and financial links on the basis of equal and friendly relations , " says C . J . Lee . At that point Taiwanese firms could base decisions as to whether to set up a center of operations directly in , say , Shanghai , or to go through Hong Kong , purely on commercial considerations , and would not have to shoulder an additional political burden .  
Finding foreign partners for joint ventures is not difficult for medium to large-sized companies with substantial financial and technological resources , but " most Taiwanese medium or small businesses have few opportunities to find foreign partners except by becoming satellite companies of Japanese firms , " says Kenneth Lai .  
The Lausanne competitiveness assessment is divided into eight evaluations , covering 225 separate items . Taiwan performed least satisfactorily in terms of financial capability , degree of internationalization , and basic infrastructure . Taiwan finished 35th or lower in a number of specific items - - openness of capital markets , modernization of financial laws and regulations , internal trade , national protectionism , and immigration law .  
In other words , even though the production base moves overseas , the " headquarters " and " logistical support center " remain in Taiwan . Operations items stay in Taiwan , along with capital sourcing , legal , tax , and financial planning , and training of internationalized personnel . All these could service the production bases located in surrounding countries .  
Informed opinion was generally positive about the overall outcome of the 22nd meeting , and in particular about Lee Yuan-tseh 's criticism of the disorder in local politics , society , and the economy . He pointed his finger directly at the struggles for power recently making political news , and at the media 's unabashed scandal-mongering and speculation . For these scholars , who besides doing their research must struggle for administrative and financial resources , the situation has been disappointing and annoying .  
Of late , members of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly , the highest publicly elected body at the provincial level , have been embroiled in numerous scandals involving election bribery , libel charges , financial disputes and various lawsuits . In an effort to clean itself up and drive out malevolent forces , the Assembly conducted a prayer session in honor of the " good brothers , " thereby resorting to ghosts instead of turning to the common people .  
Those who oppose it say " there is no room for public stations . " It is hard to guarantee that any TV station funded by the government will not become the government 's mouthpiece . After it starts broadcasting , the annual cost of NT $ 2.4 billion might very well become a financial burden on the government , not to mention that , being surrounded by dozens of highly competitive channels , PTV will have a hard time surviving .  
When ball games become staged , players are victims too . While pro baseball players may have better financial prospects than other ROC athletes , the golden years of their prime last only about a decade , and many find the chance to earn some extra money in their youth hard to pass up . They make easy prey for the underworld , which brings with it violence , threats and bribery . Once having started down that slippery slope , it 's hard to turn back .  
Six months later , however , the relationship is back in trouble and the couple eventually break up . There are also instances where one person , knowing that the relationship can not be rescued , commits suicide in order to punish their partner with a lifetime of guilt . In one case , a bright and talented financial analyst at a securities firm , despairing over the collapse of her marriage , killed herself and her two little children with doses of hydrochloric acid .  
Were all government funds to reach this level , that would mean nearly another NT $ 100 billion entering the market , which would undoubtedly provide a huge boost . Besides an influx of capital from Taiwan , in recent years , thanks to the policy goal of " financial internationalization , " Taiwan 's stock market has been opened wide to foreign investors . Given the current wave of incoming investment , foreign money has pushed the tide even higher .  
Looking at the past , the last wave of stock fever-with its tidal wave cresting past the 10,000 mark , then falling with devastating force-ended up in a massive redistribution of wealth in Taiwan . When the market is unhealthy , it can be manipulated , and naturally the rich ended up richer and the poor , poorer . Moreover , the huge financial losses of the last cycle disrupted countless families and bankrupted many businesses .  
Since the market is now up , and many provincial assemblymen who had previously opposed the plan have changed their attitudes as a result of the proposal to freeze the provincial government 's functions , the plan is moving forward again . It 's just that the sudden influx of stock will be a blow to share prices of existing stocks , and it will be hard to return financial stocks to their former level of hundreds of dollars per share .  
The company was to be headed by Rojas , the stock to be floated on the Mexican market . The Mexican City market was to be its base , chiefly responsible for financial and legal services . Miami was to be the operational and transport hub , responsible for sales , technical assistance , product planning , dispersal , warehousing , and so on .  
Ordinary families in which the husband 's and wife 's combined monthly income is only NT $ 80-90,000 not only need to meet their mortgage payments , cover their childcare fees and pay for three meals a day ; like Kuafu chasing the sun they should also be assiduously pursuing one financial goal after another , each higher than the last . ( In Chinese legend , the overambitious Kuafu chased the sun , and after catching up with it died of thirst despite drinking dry two rivers and a marsh ) .  
With technological advance and the rise of the modern financial system , the financial network built up on computer networks by corporate entities such as banks , investment trusts and multinational companies is so closely interlinked that any movement affects the whole system . This network not only extends to all countries within the region , it also links stock exchanges , forex markets , bonds , futures and even real estate and other financial products into one tightly-knit system .  
" The only purpose of financial operations is to turn a profit . There 's no such thing as moral or immoral , and no such thing as it being fair or unfair to hardworking individual countries or firms , " says Ding Kung-wha , highlighting the pragmatic and unsentimental nature of the financial world .  
In the 70s and 80s , as productive capacity continuously expanded , manufacturing profitability fell and marketing came to play the leading role , with control of brands and distribution channels the key to success . Today , competition is still more intense , and profits from both production and distribution are small . Only the rich earnings offered by financial operations are still attractive . " This is how Ding Kung-wha characterizes the global trend .  
Many conveniences are provided to make financial operations easier , and because the figures in investors ' account books do not represent physical assets they can be moved in an instant . Also , easier and easier availability of credit , in the form of unsecured loans and margin accounts ( either for buying on margin with borrowed money , or for selling on margin with borrowed shares ) , has allowed many people to grow accustomed to conducting transactions worth 10 times the capital they themselves put in .  
Furthermore , as investors grow more sophisticated and experienced , " direct participation " in financial markets , in which individual investors take risks themselves and can earn higher profits , is playing an ever greater role in advanced Western countries : shares , bonds , mutual funds and even options have all become part of the everyday life of white-collar workers .  
" This is the worldwide trend , and we ca n't buck it . " Ding Kung-wha says that most people can still choose to remain aloof and not go playing the numbers game , but if the financial sector continues to expand , and with possible inflation , in the end they will find themselves with inadequate spending power . Looking at it that way , will people finally have no choice than to get involved in the precarious and irrational financial markets ?  
Back then , the region had " poor people and few financial resources , bandits running amok , and backward culture . " Chiang first dealt with the local bandits , organizing four large public security squads , and he personally went out to the countryside to oversee efforts to quell bandit activities . Then , he moved to lay public roads , so as to facilitate transportation throughout the area .  
Among the heavy responsibilities weighing on the superintendent 's shoulders , besides having to find financial donations , is that of finding people . Recruiting local doctors has proved difficult-several times when the hospital advertised for staff there were very few applicants , and some doctors who did agree to come and work subsequently changed their minds when another opportunity came up . The disappointed Huang Sheng-hsiung saw no choice but to cast his net wider , and try to recruit doctors from America .  
But in regard to this question , the international community wants the cross-strait problem to be resolved peacefully . Though most countries accept the " one China " principle , and recognize the mainland regime as its representative , Taiwan 's democratic development and economic efforts have drawn great international attention and affirmation . In particular , Taiwan 's stability during the recent financial turmoil in Southeast Asia is evidence that Taiwan plays a critical role in ensuring the economic prosperity and regional security of East Asia .  
It is true that after the financial crisis struck there was no massive fall in the value of the Yen , but the combination of external pressures and internal difficulties-in the form of an overall default rate on bank lending of 14% , the collapse of several financial institutions , and the economic sluggishness which has dogged Japan for the last seven years-has been enough to leave the Japanese government bruised and battered .  
He also cites the example of the German software company SAP , which has risen to prominence in recent years . He explains that the company has tapped into the demand created by businesses ' need to restructure , by designing integrated software for human resource management , financial management , accounting and materials management . SAP has become the global leader in software for " enterprise resource planning , " with an annual turnover of US $ 4 billion .  
In order to create space and support in international relations , Vincent Siew has visited Southeast Asia numerous times since accepting the post of premier . During the financial meltdown , it became evident that in light of Taiwan 's close links to the financial system of Southeast Asia , we must at all times keep a friendly hand extended in that direction .  
As for tax revenue , the Ministry of Finance declared that the provincial government budget will be incorporated into the overall central government budget , while provincial sales tax will become national tax , to be allocated directly by the central government to local cities and counties . Premier Siew gave assurances that the details of financial administration will be ironed out no later than December 1 .  
At present , the mainland 's economic development is limited by serious corruption , and by the growing disparity between the standards of living of rural and urban areas , and of the coast and the interior . If these problems can not be resolved , and with the pressure from the USA on the whole of Southeast Asia , the financial crisis will continue to worsen .  
At the same time , in order to stabilize a stock market battered by the news of financial crises at many firms , a stock market stabilization committee headed by the MOF held its first meeting on November 16 . The committee has confirmed that it has arranged for a total of NT $ 283 billion from a number of sources to buy shares . The sources of this money include postal deposits , the civil-service and labor pension funds , the labor insurance fund , the government-run banks and insurance companies .  
In late 1997 , in response to the general sense of powerlessness throughout society that year following three major criminal cases , an epidemic of porcine foot and mouth disease and the Asian financial crisis , Huang Wu-hsiung again wrote an article putting forward the idea of community colleges . In it he stated : " The aim is not only to provide the public with lifelong opportunities for education , but also to revitalize Taiwanese society through knowledge and discussion , the operation of civic groups and the exchange of skills . "  
On the question of KPS setting up its own channel , Father Raymond Parent notes that when he was a member of the Government Information Office 's nine-member research team on cable television , he felt that the remit set by the GIO was too narrow , and the pace of legal reform too slow . With the chaotic situation of the time , when all cable channels were illegal , it would have been very difficult for KPS , with its limited financial resources , to enter this market .  
Dr . Sheih says that kidney disease has long been one of the ten leading causes of death in Taiwan . " Both kidney transplant patients and dialysis patients have to endure considerable pain , " he observes . In addition to this physical suffering , before the introduction of universal health insurance in Taiwan kidney disease was a tremendous financial burden for patients ; now that dialysis is covered by National Health Insurance , it is a substantial item of the system 's expenditure .  
For instance , before we broke ties with one nation , it informed us that it was facing economic collapse , that for eight months government workers had received no pay and that there had been three attempted military coups . They asked for US $ 120 million in loans or financial assistance , but this would only have been enough to meet their short-term debts .  
Setting up in a foreign country was no easy task , particularly given that before BMI was established , the Bank of Hawaii and the Bank of Guam had already divided up the local financial market between them . Because the local savings rate was low but the borrowing rate was high , Chen decided that the only way to gain the upper hand as a latecomer was to offer more efficient lending operations .  
Looking at the larger environment , in recent years , the global financial crisis and cross-strait tensions have caused economic turbulence , and firms have closed factories and laid off personnel . The situation has been especially serious in the mass media . In all areas of media , including TV , radio , newspapers , and magazines , the market is saturated , and few people are leaving their jobs .  
Other fields are also booming : With Y2K just around the corner , demand for computer experts is rising . There 's a great demand for marketing personnel in the mobile phone industry . The financial , insurance , and real estate industries are moving toward increasing professionalization and are absorbing and training a large number of new people .  
Minister without portfolio Yang Shih-chien , who handles domestic technology policy , explains : " Innovation is everything in high-technology . A brilliant , ground-breaking idea can open up a whole new field of industry . But innovation requires huge quantities of financial and human resources dedicated to R &amp; D , with laboratories pursuing technological breakthroughs around the clock , and with professional investment managers able to turn innovative ideas into products and profits . "  
Yu Tzong-shian explains that a financial economy is characterized by high risk plus high profits . With rapid flows of information and capital it becomes essential to establish fair rules of the game , along with a tight regulatory regime for the finance sector .  
The domestic financial crisis which afflicted Taiwan from the middle of last year until early this year , exposed several legally dubious forms of high-risk transaction , including excess loans , and high rates of stock collateral for company directors . Recently , the former president of the Control Yuan , Wang Tso-yung , publicly labeled the Taiwan stockmarket a " cannibal market . " The challenges of a financial economy have clearly only just begun to emerge , and economic policy will probably now confront more difficulties and resistance than ever .  
Misery and suffering left in the wake of the 21 September Chichi earthquake are still apparent over a wide area , but rebuilding continues non-stop , and appraisal of damage to buildings in the disaster areas has been completed . The government has been busy distributing financial help and contributions sent by sympathetic onlookers , and temporary housing for 4,500 families will be completed by the middle of November . These are just the first steps in post-disaster relief efforts however ; full-scale recovery still has a long way to go .  
This law should have a positive effect for current BOT projects which are facing obstacles , including the high-speed railway and the proposed rapid transit line to CKS International Airport . There will now be a legal basis for the high-speed railway to raise more capital . Also , now that the regulations for establishing new towns have been revised , the proposed plan to build a mass transit line to the airport by the Chang Yi financial group can become reality .  
3 . Regulations on a national financial stabilization fund : This law will empower the government to intervene to protect the stock market . In the event of " threats to national stability " - such as major internal or external events , rapid movements of international capital-the government will be able to draw on an NT $ 500 billion fund .  
Legal restraint involves legislation and enforcement . We must first undertake the appropriate legislative tasks , and amend laws governing political contributions , lobbying , political parties , compulsory trusts , and election rules . Once completed , the laws can only be effective if they are strictly enforced . Thus law-enforcement agencies must be able to thoroughly enforce laws in order to prevent financial interests and political interests from working together behind the scenes for illicit ends .  
Looking at this list , commentators have identified a number of characteristics : a broad , cross-party base ; attention to economic and financial issues ; emphasis on professional ability ; and stress on the appointment of women and of outstanding people from outside central government .  
A particularly testing time was the Asian financial crisis , starting in July 1997 , when the economy stumbled and the stock market index collapsed to 5000 points . The government responded by immediately cutting corporate taxes in the financial sector . This helped the industry to overcome bad debts , triggered a rebound on the stock market , and enabled the banking sector to provide relief for businesses , thus enabling Taiwan to ride out the worst of the storm .  
One major problem that has come to light is the chaotic state of Taiwan 's financial system . The KMT government was forever being criticized for allowing the intrusion of politics into the financial arena-the collusion between big money , organized crime , and political forces that is referred to as " black and gold ruling in tandem . "  
As Hsia Chen points out , the KMT needed votes so it formed a symbiotic relationship with the financial apparatus at the local level : " Give me your votes , and you can suckle here in return . " Bank directors are often involved with local factions , and operate as influential " vote captains " at election time , so it 's difficult for political forces not to get involved whenever a problem crops up .  
At the time the country was already running into financial difficulties , and social welfare expenditures were growing rapidly . Based on her solid financial and tax background and her incredible ability with figures , she came to serve as the gate-keeper . In 1995 , she became the first female director of the DNT , and within less than half a year she was named as director of the FTC .  
Dong enjoys enthusiastic support from the local community , which has provided him with generous financial assistance , manpower , filming locations , and more . The quality of his work , moreover , is well recognized ; he has received Golden Harvest Awards for Short Film and Video , Golden Ribbon Awards , and China Times Express Film Awards . He has also entered numerous works in major film festivals in Japan , Canada , Australia , and Singapore .  
Supreme Lawgiver Lin Chi-hsiung stresses that he can " cross the air to effect a cure . " Someone who is sick merely needs to put the receiver of a phone by the ill part of a body , and Lin can order the " airborne agents of the Way " to cross the sea and " exorcise the demons . " Then Lin shouts " ha " into the phone nine times and-voila ! - the patient is cured . A necessary prerequisite , however , is that the patient vow to make a financial contribution .  
On October 14 , the cabinet 's economic task force further announced eight major economic policies . These included eliminating the business tax for financial institutions , instituting a " no tax hike " policy for this presidential term , permitting the appropriate use of foreign labor , establishing a guarantee fund to provide preferential loans , allowing foreign asset management firms to handle bad loans , assisting small and medium firms to upgrade their technology , leasing out government land in industrial zones , and taking active steps to prevent electricity and water supply shortages .  
Women were dependent , the instruments of reproduction . But the industrial revolution changed all that . Women joined the production lines , home appliances reduced the time and energy women had to spend in the home , and liberated women began to enter society . As women have become equals in terms of financial support of the family , society has been transformed , and the forms of the family have become diversified .  
Politicians , academics , the media , and ordinary people are therefore all misusing the term when they employ it to describe the financial power of hei dao ( which literally translates as " the black way " and means " organized crime " ) or jin niu ( which translates literally as " gold bulls " and means " wealthy individuals who use their money for political leverage " ) . Moreover , this incorrect usage is only gaining prevalence the more it is used .  
Amid the crowds and the hubbub at the Sogo in Taipei , Taiwan 's top-grossing department store , it 's clear that these kitties bring more than just good financial fortune . Check out this rack full of copycat charms that have come from Japan on Maneki Neko 's tail . Take , for instance , this litter of Fengshui Kitties , lined up here with each holding a different colored pearl : red , purple , blue , white or yellow .  
Last year during the transition of power to a new administration , Lai 's financial expertise and ability to coordinate across issue areas did not go unnoticed . After taking the post of vice premier , he immediately proposed a number of policies of fundamental importance , including putting the financial system in order , helping traditional industries , upgrading infrastructure , promoting job creation , and inviting public participation . These outline the hopes of the new government for economic and financial development .  
Since the beginning of this year the government has held a series of national conferences on economic development , administrative reform , industrial development , and science and technology . It has also adopted a dizzying array of measures designed to stimulate the economy , including plans to spur domestic demand , bolster the property market , create job opportunities , and promote mergers between financial institutions .  
From the 1950s , after the Nationalist Government moved to Taiwan , Li served in such posts as chairman of the Industrial Development Commission , economic affairs minister and minister of finance , charting Taiwan 's economic , financial and technological development policies with bold vision . His emphasis on creating a favorable investment environment and cultivating new talent brought to Taiwan an unending flow of development projects , and earned him respect as Taiwan 's " Father of Technological Development " and " Architect of the Economic Miracle . "  
Over the past 50 years , no other individual has been appointed to ministerial posts overseeing all three areas of economic , financial and technological development affairs . During his long tenure guiding economic and financial policy , he nearly single-handedly planted the seeds for the development of Taiwan 's information industry .  
Chiang warns , " If you take a bank job , you 'd better be ready to bone up on the financial industry , sharpen your sales skills , and become a multi-talented money management advisor . " Financial products are complex and come in infinite variety . Banks badly need powerful systems for integrating financial information , so computer specialists with a strong quantitative grasp of the business will be highly valued by their employers .  
President Chen has also instructed Taiwan 's financial and economic community that regardless of whether the US fights a quick or a protracted war , Taiwan must respond with flexibility by stabilizing the equity and currency markets and guaranteeing the supply of crude oil , agricultural raw materials , and staple commodities .  
Looked at another way , the 36 local financial institutions that the government recently took over account for less than 1% of the total amount of banking business nationally . Yet , even this tiny tip of the iceberg will cost NT $ 70 billion to clean up , which is a full half of the revenues that are expected to come into the restructuring fund over the next five years .  
Thus , while the first shots fired for financial reform may look good , those on the inside can not help but worry that the government will quickly run out of ammunition . Yet there would still remain more than 300 other community financial institutions which have been running at a loss for a considerable time , not to mention the state-run and private banks of a much larger scale whose bad debts are shockingly high . The govern-ment 's ability to reform the financial system is going to face some pretty ruthless tests .  
Since the middle of this year , Citibank ( acting through Debenham Tie Leung , a property management firm based in Hong Kong ) has held a series of auctions in Taipei and Kao-hsiung to sell properties from defaulted mortgages at steep discounts . Prices at these auctions have been about 60% of the open market price , sending shock waves through the real estate and financial industries .  
Peter Kurz , CEO of the investment consulting firm Insight Pacific , observes that although Taiwan 's non-performing loan ratio is increasing , the amount for dishonored checks and bills has not correspondingly risen . " This indicates , " he explains " that the rise in the non-performance ratio is a result of the government 's increasingly strict oversight of the financial sector , and the increasing transparency of bank operations , which in fact are positive things from the point of view of foreign investors . "  
Internationally , the trend is certainly for the big to get bigger . For example , at the end of 1997 , Union Bank of Switzerland merged with Swiss Bank Corporation , and the following year Deutsche Bank purchased Bankers Trust , while Citibank merged with Travelers Group . This last merger , between two companies that were already giants , gave the resulting firm a solid grip on its ranking as the financial institution with the highest net worth in the world .  
" If you divide the financial sector up into state-run banks , private local banks , and foreign banks , the most at-risk group is that made up of the large state-run banks , which currently have the largest market share , " says Schive Chi , who knows what he 's talking about after years of experience in banking . The style of foreign banks is to make quick decisions based on comprehensive data , wielding a flexible array of products that keep up with the market .  
One figure in the business privately complains , " The government has always coddled Taiwan 's banks under the rubric of ' maintaining financial stability , ' and the banks have gotten used to it . You ca n't ask them to get lean and mean overnight . " The financial sector serves as the circulatory system feeding economic development . Taiwan has a powerful manufacturing sector , but a weak financial sector , which has always been a drag on overall national development .  
Take Citicorp , for example . Although it has a good image , offers comprehensive financial services , and is creative with its management methods , it has been frustrated to find that its business has remained limited to foreign firms and members of the economic elite . It has continued to be unsuccessful in entering the mass market .  
Not only does this allow the government , which has in recent years been in dire financial straits , to strengthen social welfare policies , each week it gives birth to several newly wealthy individuals . Over the long run , this will certainly have a positive impact on stimulating consumption . Of course , many people are not very pleased with the fondness of Taiwanease for gambling and the reliance on luck , and even more are worried about the government being the " house " and everyone thinking only about money .  
The townships are in an even more embarrassing financial condition , with many of them relying on supplementary allocations for more than 90% of their expenditures . The fact that local governments are entirely dependent on financial support from higher up the chain of government , and that all expenditure has to be approved at a higher level too , makes the entire concept of local self-rule a farce .  
According to a handbook entitled Medical Disputes Q &amp; A compiled by the Taiwan Health Reform Foundation , the types of redress most patients and their families wish for are : a reasonable explanation ; a sincere apology from the hospital and doctors ; financial responsibility to be taken for the continuing medical care of the patient ; hospitals and doctors to learn lessons ; proposals for specific reform measures ; action to prevent similar mistakes happening again ; substantive punishment for wrongdoers ; reasonable monetary damages or compensation ; and only last of all , criminal penalties .  
AVRDC director Samson C.S . Tsou points out that in nearly 30 years in Taiwan , the center 's accomplishments include raising both the quality and yields of a wide variety of tropical vegetables , including tropical tomatoes , vegetable soybeans , and crucifers . Its staff have also worked to improve the nutritional status and incomes of people in developing countries around Asia . Taiwan has been the primary source of financial support , accounting for nearly 60% of the center 's US $ 10 million budget .  
Among other things , the draft Political Party Law stipulates that in the future all political parties will be prohibited from operating or investing in profit-making enterprises or non-print mass media , and they must periodically report their financial holdings . The law further specifies that parties ' existing commercial assets must either be sold off or placed in a blind trust within two years of the law 's promulgation .  
Gay film director Mickey Chen 's experience is a good case in point . His video Not Simply a Wedding Banquet , a documentary of Taiwan 's first public gay wedding , was entered into numerous international film festivals , but Chen was turned down when he applied to the Government Information Office for financial support to enter the work in a film festival . The incident elicited a storm of protest from the artistic community , especially from noted author Hsiao Yeh . Critics charged the GIO with " anti-gay discrimination . "  
At the end of June , the Executive Yuan established a special team to outline financial reforms . Invoking existing banking laws , the Ministry of Finance announced a tiered management policy for the credit departments of farmers ' and fishermen 's associations . The goal was to follow up on the August 2001 partial intervention ( in which a special fund was used to take over and restructure 36 of the worst-run ones ) by tackling the widespread problem of unrepaid loans at these credit institutions , to protect farmers ' real interests .  
Ku enthusiastically consults with people from all areas , and has done his utmost to assist domestic research in fields related to welding . Ku also contributes by " resuscitating " expensive machinery damaged by human errors or natural disasters , thus helping industry and educational institutions reduce the massive financial losses that can result from such events . While his work has guaranteed that machinery works , he has helped even more people by passing the torch of his knowledge on to his students .  
Moreover , there is national financial distress with the government deficit exceeding NT $ 3 trillion . If loans are raised to hire unemployed workers , then a balanced budget will not be attainable within the foreseeable future . This bill would also dampen the improving economy and delay financial reform efforts , and the misallocation of resources would influence larger government projects , and be detrimental to long-term economic growth .  
In theory , highly educated children with abundant financial resources ought to have more power to fulfill their filial duties , but an industrial and commercial society values material gain and shows little concern about separation . People of higher status often have to invest more and more energy in their careers . " Why is it that the more people study the less filial they seem ? " wonders Chang Meng-jui , a senior reporter at the Min Sheng Daily who is a long-time observer of social phenomena .  
Of course , it is asking a lot of any hospital to be a designated SARS hospital , and it is a rather terrifying prospect for the staff there . For this reason all hospitals should contribute to the staffing of the special facility in rotation-time spent caring for patients , a ' vacation ' in quarantine , and then a return to their original hospitals . Staff must also be provided with the best possible protective gear and financial bonuses , so that the sense of anxiety felt by caregivers can be reduced to a minimum .  
Sun Yung-ching observes that " in industrial education , time is money . " The central reason why technical and vocational students are unable to meet the demands of industry is that the equipment they need to train on is too expensive . Schools are unable to meet the financial burden of constantly upgrading facilities and industry is unwilling to receive students for training in their plants , on the one hand because of the possible impact on output , but also out of genuine concern that students could damage precision machinery .  
Lin Chin-chu explains that some people in the area want to develop hot springs along the river , but often when hot springs areas are developed , large financial groups rush in and the tribal peoples lose control . As a result , not only do local people not reap benefits , but in the process the natural environment on which they depend for their living is damaged .  
In markets that are jointly monopolized , large financial consortiums move fast , attracting the general public in order to make a killing . Then these companies pursue various philanthropic activities to show their compassionate side , by making public displays of charitable donations to the people of Lanyu ( even if the people there have no need of their gifts ) or funding protection of sea turtles on Lanyu ( even if the extra funds actually result in more harm to the turtles ) .  
Who can avoid the reach of multi-media consortiums , with their tremendous financial resources and influence ? They can take in politicians who are down on their luck ; and even those who want to get public exposure to express their own ideas end up surrendering to the media . The result is that no one-neither the idealistic politician nor the deep thinker-ends up staying true to personal principles .  
Anyone who has traveled to Kyoto is sure to remember the streets and alleyways lined with elegant and well-maintained traditional Japanese-style residences in which people still live . Strolling those streets one feels the spirit of Japanese literature . These spaces are perhaps unsuitable to financial calculations of their worth . But their value in terms of cultural history is something that even greater economic power could not buy .  
Looking back over the financial history of Taiwan , when the Nationalist government first moved to Taiwan , it experienced hyperinflation and financial collapse , during which paper currency became worthless . Perhaps as a result of this harsh lesson , from the 1950s to the 1990s , the government maintained a very conservative posture , and its finances were continually in a healthy state .  
Because financial magazines from Taiwan are still a touchy subject in the mainland , as well as concerns about the ability of mainland editors and reporters to live up to the Commonwealth standard , they have started a new magazine . Last year they started publishing Dongfang Qiyejia in Shanghai , sourcing their launch issue 's content from the senior staff of Commonwealth , to make absolutely certain to produce a magazine just as high in quality as its Taiwanese counterpart .

Looking at the question from the " support " side , elderly people have more financial and physical ability to look after themselves , so aged parents no longer need to rely on their children . Also , young people are now putting off marriage until much later , so they have much more time under their personal control . Finally , young people have their own marketable skills and incomes , so they do n't need to be under the thumb of their parents . For all these reasons , a carefree life seems a good choice .  
Some say the family is like a refuge where members can find shelter from life 's trials and hardships . Others say the family is like a financial institution that provides for daily necessities . Some people liken the family to a silk cocoon-warm and comfortable but closed off and restrictive . Yet others liken the family to a poisonous snake where members are bound together , but by bonds of hatred and dislike instead of love and caring .  
According to Chi , single mothers receive very little support in Taiwan . At the GHF , for example , only a minority of girls who decide to keep their baby get any financial or emotional support from their parents , and then only after considerable resistance from them . Most unmarried girls who choose the hard road of raising their child , do so without the proper skills or support from their family or boyfriend .  
Their medicinal work was mostly done at night , after their day 's farmwork was done . Kung had loved drawing since childhood , and spent all his money on art supplies for his hobby . With the family in rough financial shape and art hardly a viable way to make a living , Kung 's father was n't impressed with this obsession , and would often sternly tell Kung off for it , so he carried on with his artwork behind his father 's back . Gourds and Chinese macrame  
The Ministry of Finance should rigorously investigate and hold banks accountable for administrative and criminal liability in this area . Next time a financial institution is found to have leaked customers ' confidential information , the paper suggests , it should be penalized by being barred or restricted from opening new branches or starting new lines of business .  
These " financial monsters " can certainly rely on the synergy of large scale and cross-financial industry operations to be more competitive worldwide . But an enterprise that 's like an octopus with intertwining tentacles everywhere can of course easily hide its evil ways . It must be overseen by a more professional , more authoritative financial organization with special regulatory responsibilities that can operate on a higher moral plane .  
Based on these two criteria , the CEPD has compiled a list of 12 critical service industries for future development . These are : financial services ; research and development ; design ; cultural and creative services ; telecommunications and media ; medical , health care and caregiving ; engineering consulting ; information services ; distribution and transportation ; manpower training , manpower services and property management ; tourism , sporting and recreational services ; and environmental protection .  
This agreement guarantees that the reimbursement that the hospital receives for a quarter will be equal to what it received in the same quarter the previous year . However , any claims exceeding this sum will not be honored by the BNHI . In other words , if a hospital 's expenditures surpass the upper limit set by the BNHI , it will likewise face a situation where the more health care services it provides , the greater its financial losses .

Hani introduced that the Afghan interim government submitted the government budget of the 2002 fiscal year of a total sum of 0.46-billion USD in the meeting of the Executive Team of Aids to Afghanistan held in April .

The rapid and complete collapse of the previous system in the last years of the 1980s was characterized by a demoralizing and debilitating paralysis of the political , economic , financial , administrative and social structures of the country .  
Moreover , at the international level , there is no clear evidence as yet of the provision of adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , in particular to developing countries , for sustainable development .

Reiterates that any administering or occupying Power that deprives the colonial peoples of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
The European Union , as it has already stated on previous occasions , particularly in the High-level Working Group on the Financial Situation of the United Nations , attaches the greatest political importance to the need to find a solution to the Organization 's financial crisis in order to establish a solid , permanent financial base for the Organization , thus enabling the United Nations to carry out all the mandates entrusted to it .  
We should also stress the support of friendly countries directly interested in the region , particularly those that have cooperated , and continue to cooperate , with the Secretary-General in the search for political solutions , and those that have provided technical and financial assistance for the implementation of special programmes of cooperation designed to supplement the peace efforts by attacking the structural causes of our problems and strengthening the democratic process . 
The concerted efforts of the international community must be directed towards , and must lead to , concrete programmes of action and the consolidation of an effective platform for international cooperation , with the support of the Secretariat and the agencies of the United Nations system , and also those of the developed countries and world or regional financial bodies for international cooperation .  
As a result of its financial assistance for local environmental health projects , its close ties with municipalities and the Palestinian Authority , and its collaborative relationship with three major solid waste projects in the Gaza Strip , UNRWA was instrumental in achieving coordination and promoting common standards and strategies in the environmental health sector among the Palestinian Authority , local municipalities and non-governmental organizations operating in the Gaza Strip .  
The Government of Ukraine has developed a large-scale national programme aimed at safeguarding the rights of national minorities and indigenous peoples and has established a fund for the deported peoples of Crimea . But for Ukraine , which faces conditions of economic crisis and a complicated financial situation and lacks the necessary infrastructure , services and mechanisms , the task of accommodating the hundreds of thousands of repatriated persons appears too complicated .  
But in the final analysis the proper functioning and efficiency of the United Nations depend first and foremost on the political support that Member States , especially the most powerful , give to multilateralism , as well as the political , military and financial resources they are prepared to make available to international organizations .  
The transfer of major financial resources to and from our markets causes great instability in capital flows in the world , leading to concern and uncertainty , and threatens the accumulated efforts of our peoples to establish a more just , more orderly and more stable economic system .  
We hope that the current negotiations amongst the various international organizations concerned will lead to the desired coordination between monetary , financial and trade policies and thereby lead to the laying of genuine foundations for free international trade , wherein there would be no deterioration in the terms of trade or any decline in the prices of primary commodities .  
Not so much economic or political as ethical in nature , this crisis has weakened our institutions and undermined our financial system , the collapse of which cost us 16 per cent of our gross national product and has attracted the not-always-understanding attention of international opinion . 
We are confident that a Middle East zone free of nuclear and weapons of mass destruction would enhance the peace process and lead to a situation wherein enormous financial resources would be saved and channelled towards the economic prosperity and social development of the peoples of the region .  
In this connection , I join others in calling on the international community to devise a global strategy to effectively address the debt question confronting the least developed countries , and to use innovative measures whether it be official development aid , foreign direct investment or multilateral financial assistance to arrest the decline of resources destined for the least developed countries .  
The debt crisis , depressed prices of primary commodities , protectionist measures , the inadequate flow of direct foreign investment and financial and technical assistance , and deteriorating terms of trade are but a few of the factors adversely affecting socio-economic performance in most of these countries .  It is with this frustrating situation in mind that we intend to continue participating in the work of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group of this Assembly on An Agenda for Development .  
The Islamic Republic of Mauritania which , since 1984 , has been engaged in a determined battle that aims at restructuring the Mauritanian economy despite difficult domestic , regional and international conditions , has made tangible progress towards restoring the macroeconomic balance and reducing its foreign debt , a fact that is attested to by international financial institutions . 
The international community should make its best endeavours to ensure that our efforts are adequately supported through complementary financial and technological support , including improved terms of trade , increased flows of direct foreign investment and appropriate debt relief measures .  
On the contrary , despite our smallness and our relative lack of resources , we have been a consistent and active contributor of troops to various peace-keeping missions .  Fiji has paid a heavy human and financial price for contributing troops , but it has done so gladly and willingly and will continue to do so .  
While the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro was seen as a defining moment in the quest for sustainability and environmental protection , Fiji regrets that a lack of political commitment , coupled with donor fatigue , has been responsible for the failure of most developed countries to allocate adequate financial resources to enable developing countries to tackle the plethora of problems associated with environmental degradation .  
Indeed , the Fourth World Conference on Women , which ended only last month in Beijing , has given impetus to the need for programmes that speak to the issues of women in development and , most critically , the empowerment of women in local communities , enabling their full participation at all levels in the process of national development .  Grenada is encouraged by the new spirit of international cooperation built on a shared partnership between multilateral financial institutions and Governments .  
We are , however , alert to the dangers associated with that sector and , while pursuing the benefits to be derived from such institutions , we must be ever on guard for white-collar criminals who , as part of their everyday activity , launder their ill-gotten gains through the international financial systems , using both public - and private-sector capital projects for this purpose .  
I am certain that the establishment of a special status , with international security guarantees , consolidated financial and technical assistance and moral incentives , for countries that renounce nuclear weapons would provide a tremendous impetus for expediting the process of nuclear disarmament .  
But the Organization now needs to rethink itself in order to devote all its resources human , financial , institutional and technical to the great undertaking of redressing the unjust economic and social imbalances and the related problems of the environment , in the conviction that this is not only a moral imperative but the ideal way of strengthening peace .  
Countries of the South should not remain trapped in poverty and underdevelopment nor constrained by low commodity prices , unfavourable trade practices , dwindling resource inflows , restrictions in the transfer of technology , unpredictable global monetary and financial systems and external debt burden .  
Therefore , an overall system of enabling mechanisms is necessary , engaging the human , political , economic , financial and socio-cultural resources necessary for the World Programme of Action to be implemented on the national , regional and international level .  
This is the case of the economic , commercial and financial blockade that for more than 34 years has been imposed by the Government of the United States against Cuba , in violation of the most fundamental norms of international law , of peaceful coexistence among sovereign and independent nations , and of freedom of trade and navigation .  
During this year the international community has viewed with deep concern and alarm the approval by the United States Congress of legislative initiatives to move the economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba to unimaginable levels , particularly the new extraterritorial dimensions that the most conservative circles in the Congress want to give to a policy that , since its inception , has been designed to impose United States law on third States .  
The Heads of State or Government called upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial measures and actions against Cuba , which , in addition to being unilateral and contrary to the United Nations Charter , international law and the principle of good neighbourliness , cause huge material losses and economic damage .  
In fact , although the changes that took place in the wake of the cold war led to a certain easing in international relations and promoted , as never before , democratic values , the international situation nevertheless has continued to deteriorate in recent times in the political , economic , social and financial spheres .  
The increase in the number of Member States to 185 ; the end of the cold war and the concomitant , regrettable radicalization of nationalism and group identity , which cause internal and inter-State conflicts ; and the perverse effects of the economic and financial crisis on the democratization of institutions and on human rights all these events and challenges highlight the urgent need to carry out a reform of the United Nations in general and of the Security Council in particular . 
The aim of a comprehensive financial reform must be to establish a transparent and reliable scale , reflective of Members ' real capacity to pay , automatically adaptable to changed national circumstances and giving consideration to the needs of countries with low per capita incomes .  
The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean certainly want such technical cooperation to be increased and more intensified and would like to see the United Nations double or even triple its human and financial efforts in order to fulfil this obligation , which is inscribed in the Charter and in countless resolutions of the General Assembly and other United Nations bodies .  
Indeed , 50 years after its founding , and facing the continuing economic and financial crisis that gravely undermines individual and collective development efforts and is a destabilizing factor for young States and for international peace and security , the United Nations is duty-bound to play a more active , indeed a central , role in promoting economic , social and cultural cooperation in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter .  
For its part , and despite its difficult economic and financial conditions , Cameroon , like other developing countries and African ones in particular , confirming its political will and joining in the expansion of the lofty ideals of the United Nations , recently paid up nearly all its arrears in contributions due the Organization .  
The adoption and future implementation of the prototype for the new format of the medium-term plan for the period 1998 to 2001 , the introduction of a transparent and efficient system of accountability and responsibility , and the decentralization of regional economic commissions and of social and economic activities : all these are reform measures that foster administrative and financial efficiency in the Organization in the economic and social spheres .  
Although useful as a way of promoting the economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries , South-South cooperation is no substitute for international cooperation , which , in the interests of the harmonious development of an interdependent world , must , inter alia , guarantee financial , technical and technological assistance to developing countries .  
In this context , more equitable financial , monetary , trading and technological relations must provide the basis for re-establishing trade as an effective instrument for mutual development , for reconciling peoples and strengthening the international community .  
It was with a deep understanding of global interdependence in the protection of environmental safety on the European continent that the President of Ukraine took the political decision to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , on condition that adequate international financial and material support be provided .  
In this context , our delegation notes with satisfaction the significant activity of major donor countries and of the international financial organizations , primarily the World Bank , to provide scientific , expert and technological assistance to the Palestinian people to tackle tasks related to the need to improve their social and economic conditions rapidly , strengthen institutions of self-government , establish a financial and banking system , and train highly qualified national personnel .  
It also urged the international community to increase the financial resource flows to Africa , as these are crucial to regenerate economic growth and sustainable development , and to provide effective support to political reforms and help cushion their adverse social consequences .  
On another subject , my delegation fully supports the proposals relating to advancing financial intermediation in Africa , as this is a way to strengthen local savings structures and to link them with modern banks and financial institutions , with a view to generating local resources at this time when official development assistance is dwindling at an unprecedented rate .  
As clearly stated in the report in document A / 50 / 490 , financial systems in Africa are unsophisticated , narrow and shallow , due mainly to general underdevelopment , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pervasive Government intervention in credit allocation .  
Ghana has reduced the direct intervention of the Government in the economy and increased reliance on the market by decontrolling interest rates as a means of raising the rates on savings deposits and loans , reducing subsidies aimed at the promotion of specific sectors or enterprises , privatizing banks and reducing restrictions on financial activities , developing the domestic capital market and easing restrictions on foreign investments in the domestic banking system and capital market .  
It is pertinent to indicate that the financial reforms , as the report before us notes , have so far focused almost exclusively on the formal financial sector and have neglected the informal sector with quite a vast savings potential .  
This new framework of solidarity would break with the almost exclusive , dependence on financial inflows from abroad by better exploiting the potential of trade , private investment and access to technology and reforming international financial institutions so as to better integrate them with other parts of the United Nations system and make them better suited to take care of the needs of poor countries in economic and social development .  
This is so for a number of reasons : first , its long-standing relationship with the countries in and around the conflict area and its consistent policies in favour of a balanced and durable political settlement ; secondly , because of the experience and know-how of Bulgarian companies with a long record of practical work in the area ; thirdly , acquired knowledge and expertise in working with international financial institutions in implementing programmes for reconstruction and development .  
For our part , in addition to supporting the Assembly resolutions on the subject , we have declared a unilateral moratorium on mine production , and with regard to a case which affects us directly the mines planted by our armed forces on the Malvinas Islands in 1982 we have offered our cooperation and financial help to the United Kingdom for their removal , which is proceeding with the greatly appreciated cooperation of the United States .  
In that regard , the Summit called for increased funding for foreign assistance by governmental and non-governmental donors and multilateral financial institutions to specific programmes in primary education for girls , preventive health care and political participation and encouraged developing countries to use the 20 / 20 concept in planning and funding their human development priorities .  
The implementation of the Declaration and Programme of Action will require mobilization of new and additional financial resources at the national and international levels , better and effective utilization of the existing resources , enhanced assistance from the developing countries and a substantial reduction in their debt burden .  
Without this new partnership at the national level , but also at the international level a partnership whose translation into action requires mobilization of the necessary resources by Member States and Bretton Woods multilateral financial institutions our solidarity will be in vain and the social contract worked out in Copenhagen for the well-being of present and future generations will remain a hypothetical goal . 
We see nothing controversial about requesting the administering Powers not to violate the Charter by exploiting the natural resources of the inhabitants of the Non-Self-Governing Territories or in any way subordinating their rights and interests to foreign economic and financial interests .  Is it really wrong to urge these Powers to ensure that acceptable working conditions prevail in these Territories ?  
The road to disarmament is lengthy and arduous but indispensable if the world is to enjoy lasting security and stability , in view of the fact that security and stability are linked to economic and social development and that development requires financial and other resources which are swallowed up by the arms race .  
Secondly , the elimination of nuclear weapons , whether immediate or gradual , would certainly lead to the attainment of a world free of nuclear weapons and eventually of all weapons of mass destruction and would facilitate complete and general disarmament which , in turn , would ease tensions in the world at large and help redirect financial and other resources to economic and social development .  
Recognizing the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to humanitarian and natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the continuum to development ,  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .

Recommends that Governments promote the establishment of a social infrastructure in rural areas that encourages women , including poor women , to develop capacities and skills such as leadership in administrative and financial management for collective and community life , and that supports rural women 's organizations and their participation in representative and economic bodies ( for example , farmers ' organizations , workers ' unions , cooperatives and associations ) ;  
In her opening statement , the Secretary-General of the Fourth World Conference on Women stressed that the preparatory process at the national and regional levels had proceeded successfully owing to the strong involvement of Governments , international , political , financial and development organizations , the private sector , academic and research institutions , donors and , especially , non-governmental organizations .  
The subjects and emerging issues to be addressed in greater detail , both globally and for major countries and groups of countries , will include the following : output and income , macroeconomic policy-making , the world energy situation , international trade and trade policy , international transfers of financial resources and financial cooperation , and other selected social and economic issues of a more structural nature .  
Japan appreciated the role played by the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in providing advisory services and technical and financial assistance at the request of Governments and the role played by regional human rights machinery in supporting human rights activities and programmes .  
Governments at the appropriate level , with the cooperation of the relevant United Nations bodies and regional , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , the private sector and financial institutions , and taking into consideration indigenous people and their communities , as well as social and economic factors , should :  
Research to assess the comparative social , environmental and financial costs and benefits of different technologies for basic and reproductive health care within a framework of universal safety and ethical considerations ;  
To identify and strengthen or develop , as required , in particular in developing countries , the appropriate institutional , legal and financial mechanisms to ensure that water policy and its implementation are a catalyst for sustainable social progress and economic growth .  
The programme covered areas where the secretariat had established operational capacities and addressed such specific areas as export diversification and trade development , customs and trade facilitation , trade statistics , debt management , external financial flows and investments , domestic financial markets , insurance and transport , as well as the regulatory framework affecting those areas and the business environment in general .  
The Protocol was a complex and detailed document which empowered the Palestinian authority in a range of fields : imports and customs ; monetary and financial issues , including taxation ; labour mobility and social insurance ; the free movement of agricultural and industrial goods between the two sides ; insurance issues ; and tourism .  
Under meetings , seminars and workshops , most member organizations have specific plans and dates for training courses on national accounts concepts and practices and other specialized statistical systems linked with the SNA , such as balance of payments , government finance , and monetary and financial statistics , as well as interregional and regional workshops and seminars on practical implementation of the 1993 SNA .  
Strongly urges the international community to continue to provide , in a timely and effective manner , the financial , material and technical assistance necessary to enhance the individual and collective capacity of the front-line States and other neighbouring States in their efforts towards the reconstruction , rehabilitation and development of their economies ;  
Supports the treatment accorded to Nicaragua in the light of its continuing exceptional circumstances , so that the international community and financial institutions can incorporate that treatment into programmes to support the country 's economic recovery and social reconstruction ;  
As to the financial resources , the representative replied that the process of providing government aid would be a gradual one ; by gradually transforming the current educational system , primary education would become government aided , and university and other forms of tertiary education would be on a cost-sharing basis .  
Review the impact of structural adjustment programmes on social development , including , where appropriate , by means of gender sensitive social impact assessments and other relevant methods , in order to develop policies to reduce their negative effects and improve their positive impact ; the cooperation of international financial institutions in the review could be requested by interested countries ;  
Undertake to explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction in excessive military expenditures including global military expenditures and arms trade , investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development ;  
Inviting the international community , including the international financial institutions , to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development without falling into a new debt crisis ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Angola Verification Mission II until payment is effected .  
Urges the multilateral financial institutions , recipient countries and donor countries , within the conceptual framework and design and implementation of structural adjustment policies in Africa , to pay special attention to eradicating poverty and addressing the social impact of these policies , while focusing on public investment , fiscal reform , reform of public enterprises , export expansion and efficient public administration ;  
Urges the international community to increase financial resource flows to Africa , as these are crucial in order to regenerate the growth and sustainable development of the African economies , to provide effective support to the political and economic reforms in which many African countries are now engaged and to help cushion adverse social consequences ;  
At the same time , many non-governmental organizations note and are concerned that factors such as distance , limited human and financial resources , and unequal access to information are tending to distinguish between those non-governmental organizations that are closely following international processes and those , particularly in the developing world , that are not .  
Requests the Secretary-General , without further delay , to provide the Special Rapporteur with all the necessary human and financial assistance in carrying out his mandate and enabling him to submit in a timely manner an interim report to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session under the item entitled " Elimination of racism and racial discrimination " .  [ 1 ] / A / 49 / 677 , annex .  
It is suggested that macroeconomic frameworks conducive to mobilizing financial resources be developed and that the allocation of significant resources through partnership agreements and bilateral or multilateral arrangements be continued and enhanced .  
Considerable resources , both human and financial , have been devoted to the process over the past two years , in relation to support to the ad hoc secretariat , to Governments in affected countries , to the definition of the technical , scientific and political issues involved and to the formulation of the texts of the Convention and the regional annexes .  
Invites the international development agencies and organizations , including the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the United Nations Development Programme , to take account of the potential of elderly women as a human resource for development and to include older women in their development strategies and programmes , and encourages Governments to ensure the inclusion of women , regardless of age , in development projects covered by national and multilateral financial institutions ;  
Matching their institutional mandate , professional expertise and proved record with adequate financial support would have a direct measurable impact in the short and medium term .  
The three main objectives of the conference would be ( a ) to mobilize a political and economic " mountain lobby " capable of demonstrating to Governments , policy makers and planners the potential contribution of mountain areas to national and regional development ; ( b ) to introduce the financial and planning instruments needed to incorporate mountain development into national plans and budgets ; and ( c ) to examine the specific human , social and technological characteristics of mountain areas .  
Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation shall take practical steps to coordinate their tax and price policies , ensure the access of authorized banks to each other 's domestic markets , apply an exchange rate that is determined by supply and demand , support stable rates of exchange of their national currencies , and undertake other measures with a view to creating a common financial market .  
Although the Marriage Act had been designed to ensure equal treatment for men and women , in reality , women sometimes found themselves in difficult financial circumstances after a divorce ; that eventuality was however covered by the social security system , and if necessary it was also possible to obtain a living allowance from the municipal authority .  
In low-income countries where these aims conflict with the efforts of poor farmers to expand cultivation , special programmes with international financial and technical support will be needed to assist rural communities in developing alternative livelihoods .  
Appeals to the international community , international organizations , multilateral financial institutions , specialized agencies , organs and programmes of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations as well as all interested groups to provide developing countries , in particular African countries , with technical , medical and financial assistance commensurate with the efforts needed to control this endemic disease ;  
Also emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic recovery and growth of the world economy , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ,  
Thus , it was stated that the establishment of an international criminal court , with the subsidiary organs mentioned in article 5 and other infrastructures , would entail an enormous financial outlay which might be an extra burden for developing countries .  
The active involvement of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors should be encouraged , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , cooperatives , local community groups , women 's organizations , the media , non-governmental organizations , youth organizations , cultural groups , and financial and other for-profit organizations .  
The considerably longer labour hours of women and limited access to paid labour because of the lack of financial resources complicates the potential expansion of agricultural production even where women have traditional , and often seasonal , rights to husband 's labour for such tasks as helping to clear their individual plots .  
Stressing that , as stated in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development , held at Cairo from 5 to 13 September 1994 , [ 2 ] / family reunification of documented migrants is an important factor in international migration , and that financial remittances by documented migrants to their countries of origin often constitute a very important source of foreign exchange and are instrumental in improving the well-being of relatives left behind ,  
In addition to the financial means provided for this purpose , a number of United Nations bodies and organizations , including FAO , UNESCO , UNIDO and UNEP , have spent a considerable share of their regular programme funds on supporting programmes and activities related to science for sustainable development and scientific capacity-building in developing countries .  
In this way , countries are part of coherent synergistic international programmes and networks that not only advance knowledge in the interests of all but also utilize more efficiently scarce human and financial resources , keeping duplication to a minimum .  
Improved and innovative institutional , legal and financial arrangements relating to private sector collaboration , university-industry linkage , strategic business alliances and venture capital have been extensively developed to address the emerging issues relating to new biotechnology .  
Major constraints being experienced by the countries include , in particular , a drastic decline in financial resources to adequately maintain the various valuable scientific and technological infrastructures and , of increasing concern , the critical reduction in the scientific workforce in bioscience and biotechnology .  
Recognizing the high costs of research in biotechnology , several existing agricultural research institutes have strengthened or initiated new biotechnology programmes to address the common elements of research and development as well as the training needs of developing countries in many areas outlined under programme area E , with support from financial institutions , foundations and , to a lesser extent , the private business sector .  
Invites Member States , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , physical , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to take appropriate steps to ensure adequate financial and human resources and logistical support for the speedy deployment of a sufficient number of human rights field officers and for the delivery of programmes of technical assistance and advisory services ;  
It should be noted that , following a 1993 initiative of the World Bank , a growing number of financial institutions are meeting to discuss very practical affairs of common concern , such as procedures for assuring the environmental quality of projects and economic analysis of environmental projects .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
" that the amount of financial indebtedness resulting from non-compliance with contractual obligations of certain missions accredited to the United Nations has increased to alarming proportions " , reminded " all permanent missions to the United Nations , their personnel and Secretariat personnel of their responsibilities to meet such obligations " , and expressed " the hope that the efforts undertaken by the Committee , in consultation with all concerned , will lead to a solution of this problem " . 
The most drastic examples of abuse of the members of the Albanian national minority are placing of children in the front rows of separatist demonstrations , spreading rumour about alleged mass poisoning of Albanian children and the forcibly preventing the young generation from acquiring compulsory elementary education and other levels of education in their mother tongue for which Serbia and Yugoslavia have provided all necessary material , financial and personnel conditions .  
Other types of policies are needed for promoting economic growth and trade , changing demographic behaviour , developing human resources , alleviating poverty , promoting the transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound technology and financial resources , and managing natural resources .  
The latter 's objective is to enable people with low incomes in the Appalachian region successfully to enter the economic mainstream by , inter alia , organizing cooperative ventures among small firms to produce for niche markets , mobilizing financial resources on behalf of the region from outside , creating learning clusters in conjunction with other communities in the country , providing transitional support for people moving from welfare to work , and developing production and leadership skills .  
The possibility of reducing the huge financial , material and human resources devoted to the military sector and reallocating part of them to the civilian sector of national economies has been the object of deliberations within the framework of the United Nations for over three decades .  
At the end of the 12-month period provided in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account until payment is effected ;  
Despite the cyclical fall in contributions to multilateral institutions , developing countries ' receipts from this source were cushioned to some extent by the fact that the multilateral institutions , especially the international financial institutions , can draw on income from previous years to make their current disbursements .  
To support private pollution abatement investment , Governments in OECD countries , economies in transition and developing countries have used a wide range of policy instruments , which may be divided into three main categories : directed credit programmes , financial incentives , co-financing arrangements and venture capital funds .  
As a result , future discussions of the cross-sectoral issues of financing environmentally sound technology transfer and biotechnology should focus on the availability of external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure and fiscal incentives and the availability of resources from innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds .  
In addition to its introduction and my concluding observations , the report includes seven sections , devoted respectively to military aspects ; public security aspects ; human rights , the judicial system and the Commission on the Truth ; electoral matters ; economic and social issues ; financial aspects ; and administrative aspects .  
In her opening statement , the Secretary-General of the Fourth World Conference on Women stressed that the preparatory process at the national and regional levels had proceeded successfully owing to the strong involvement of Governments , international political , financial and development organizations , the private sector , academic and research institutions , donors and , especially , non-governmental organizations .  
Enhance the access of disadvantaged women , including women entrepreneurs , in rural , remote and urban areas to financial services through strengthening links between the formal banks and intermediary lending organizations , including legislative support , training for women and institutional strengthening for intermediary institutions with a view to mobilizing capital for those institutions and increasing the availability of credit ;  
Recommends that Governments promote the establishment of any social infrastructure in rural areas that encourages women , including poor women , to develop capacities and skills such as leadership in administrative and financial management for collective and community life , and that supports rural women 's organizations and their participation in representative and economic bodies ( for example , farmers ' organizations , workers ' unions , cooperatives and associations ) ;  
In the view of the authors , the significant international financial support anticipated by the Programme of Action has not materialized ; the science and technology policies and programmes of the United Nations system are hardly coordinated around strategic goals ; institutional and programme adjustments are inadequate and a common operational science and technology framework is absent .  
Use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting of country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to mobilize more efficiently new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .  
There was general agreement that the analytical framework presented by the matrix was illustrative , would help in integrating the application of the range of financial instruments and policy options with individual sectors and cross-sectoral activities , and could prove valuable in identifying the appropriate and most promising options , as well as their complementarity , taking into account the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities .  
Future discussions on financial aspects of environmentally sound technologies and biotechnology should consider the need for external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure , fiscal incentives and the potential availability of resources from innovative mechanisms , such as co-financing and venture capital funds ;  
Among such new approaches are the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , including foreign direct investment ; improved coordination and cooperation among national institutions in recipient and donor countries , on the basis of national sustainable development strategies ; partnership arrangements ; and networking between scientific institutes active in the field of sustainable development in various countries and regions .  
Work focuses on the practical problems that need to be resolved so that policies undertaken in respect of internalization do not impair the development efforts of developing countries and that they are consistent with the economic , financial , institutional , legal and social conditions of those countries .  
In the recent UNCTAD / UNEP high-level meeting on trade , environment and development , it was felt that future work on multilateral environmental agreements should focus on a more detailed empirical analysis of the use of trade measures , including conditions for the legitimate use of trade measures , the design of such measures , special circumstances of developing countries in relation to the agreements and trade policy , and the additional financial and other requirements for developing countries .  
For example , the UNCTAD Standing Committee on Commodities decided that there was considerable scope for financial and technical cooperation between developed and developing countries for improving the environmental advantages of natural products .  
Work focuses on the practical problems that need to be resolved so that policies undertaken in respect of internalization do not impair the development efforts of developing countries and are consistent with the economic , financial , institutional , legal and social conditions of those countries .  See E / CN . 17 / 1994 / CRP . 2 .  
Expand women 's access to financial markets by identifying and encouraging financial supervisory and regulatory reforms that support direct and indirect efforts on the part of financial institutions to better meet the credit and other financial needs of the micro , small and medium-scale enterprises of women ;  
Authorizes States , notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 3 ( a ) , 3 ( b ) and 4 of resolution 661 ( 1990 ) and subsequent relevant resolutions , to permit the import of petroleum and petroleum products originating in Iraq , including financial and other essential transactions directly relating thereto , sufficient to produce a sum not exceeding a total of one-billion United States dollars every 90 days for the purposes set out in this resolution and subject to the following conditions :

Reiterates that any administering or occupying Power that deprives the colonial peoples of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Invites all governmental and non-governmental organizations , financial institutions , Member States and organizations of the United Nations system to grant or to continue to grant Tokelau special emergency economic assistance to mitigate the effects of cyclonic storms and to enable the Territory to meet its medium - and long-term reconstruction and rehabilitation requirements and address the issues of changes in climatic patterns . 
The Committee will also consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , information and financial matters .  
ACC noted that while issues relating to economic reforms and growth were being pursued with vigour and financial support , mainly from the Bretton Woods institutions , the pursuit of the social and environmental dimensions of development , including the protection of human rights , was lagging , owing to a lack of adequate resources and a proper appreciation of the linkages among the various dimensions of development .  
Recalling that a reappraisal of the 1921 principle , on which common system remuneration is based , was long overdue , ACC reiterated its concern that the current remuneration system was outdated and needed to be overhauled to become competitive with bilateral and other multilateral financial and aid agencies . 
While many major contributors scrupulously fulfilled their financial obligations , a considerable portion of outstanding contributions for both current and prior years was attributable to the non-payment by some major contributors .  
The structural reforms undertaken in the banking sector centred on privatizing State-owned banks , reducing barriers to entry for both domestic and foreign private banks , liberalizing the types of activities that banks could undertake and , concomitantly , improving the prudential regulation of financial institutions .  
One favourable consequence of the relative openness of the financial sector has been an acceleration of foreign private capital inflows , with the developing countries of the ESCAP region becoming the largest recipient of private capital flows among all developing countries world wide .  
In an in-house study conducted at UNU / WIDER on " Resource Mobilization and Sustainable Growth in Africa " some progress was made towards outlining a set of consistent and feasible fiscal , monetary and institutional plans to mobilize human , financial , technological and environmental resources to achieve a self-sustaining path of long-term growth .  
Substantive and technical services will be provided to ( a ) the Committee on Energy , the working parties on coal , gas and electric power , and the Steering Committee of the Energy Efficiency 2000 Project ; and ( b ) meetings of experts on energy efficiency standards and labelling systems ( 2 ) , financial engineering of energy efficiency projects ( 2 ) , renewable sources of energy , natural gas statistics , and public acceptance and environmental aspects of major regional energy programmes .  
In this context , the activities planned during the biennium 1996-1997 will focus on trends in the region 's external sector and the analysis of trade policy options , including implementation of activities in the field of commercial and foreign trade policies ; economic relations of Latin America and the Caribbean with countries in major trading blocs ; development financing and monetary and financial policies for development ; and financial aspects of social policies .  
In an era of financial stringency , the limited resources available to assist developing countries must be directed prudently towards those investments with the highest payoff ; experience in country after country demonstrates that water and sanitation improvements are vital to economic progress and , more broadly , provide the very foundations for sustainable human development .  
On the contrary , through its implementation the Government has induced financial institutions to get to know their customers better and undertake a specific and direct surveillance of transactions in order to prevent their being used as instruments for the illegal concealment , handling , investment or use of money or other goods coming not only from drug-trafficking activities but from any other kind of criminal activity .  
The subjects and emerging issues to be addressed in greater detail , both globally and for major countries and groups of countries , will include the following : output and income , macroeconomic policy-making , the world energy situation , international trade and trade policy , international transfers of financial resources and financial cooperation , and other selected social and economic issues of a more structural nature .  
Invites the international community to continue to lend its political , diplomatic , material and financial support to end the violence , to help the Government of Burundi to find a lasting solution to the political and ethnic tensions and to create conditions to favour the reintegration of refugees and displaced persons and , in this context , requests the Secretary-General to strengthen the office of his special representative in Bujumbura ;  
From activities scattered over a wide spectrum of disparate fields in the form of a plethora of relatively small projects , UNDP has moved steadily to concentrate its scarce human and financial resources on a small number of priority thematic goals .  
The use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to more efficiently mobilize new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .  
Services on economic reforms in the least developed countries ; economic and financial management in Pacific island developing countries ; demographic issues in the Pacific island developing countries ; institutional capability-building , including private sector development for the promotion of industrial investment and technology transfer ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( b ) Group training , including seminars and workshops .  
On a more positive note , some have launched innovative schemes for reducing the use of foreign exchange in regional transactions , for example the introduction by the PTA of a traveller 's cheque , while among other developing countries a limited number of multilateral trade financing and export-credit guarantee facilities have been established , and in others financial resources are being increasingly mobilized through the establishment of regional capital markets .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account until payment is effected .  
UNFPA will , therefore , develop a strategy for future allocations of its limited resources to help build capacities in developing countries to implement the Programme of Action , based on different levels of financial needs for multilateral assistance and the level of achievement with regard to quantitative goals of the Conference .  
The main rationale for the implementation of the Abuja Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community was that major prerequisites , including social stability , sustained economic development and social progress , could not be achieved by individual countries in isolation .  Major obstacles to regional cooperation and integration are the paucity or lack of financial resources to support the process .  
While welcoming the decision of JCGP to set a target date for this exercise , the General Assembly in resolution 47 / 199 emphasized that that process should be achieved in cooperation with host Governments in a way that increased efficiency , such as by means of the consolidation of administrative infrastructures of the organizations concerned , and with no financial increase in the cost of operations either to the United Nations system or the host developing country .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account until payment is effected .  
The Fund also held several in-house workshops for members of UNFPA country support teams ( CST ) to enhance their technical skills ; organized a workshop for 14 senior officers from headquarters and the field to improve their management skills ; and organized two regional training courses for field staff to improve financial accountability and to facilitate accurate and transparent reporting of expenditures .  
This means that the various cooperation agreements to be signed with the State institutions concerned must specify the commitments which these institutions are taking on ( political , institutional , administrative , technical , financial and legal , as the case may be ) and the specific contributions that will have to be made .  
Furthermore , the representative of DDSMS stated that the current financial situation of INSTRAW demanded that major efforts be made by the Acting Director , with the assistance of the Board members , to ensure that the level of contribution for research and training in 1995 and succeeding years be substantially increased .  
In its letter to the President of the General Assembly and in subsequent oral and written representations to the Committee on Contributions , Iraq stated its view and stressed that its inability to pay resulted from the comprehensive embargo imposed by Security Council resolutions , which had deprived Iraq of its financial resources .  
Constraints on the development of the public utilities included the lack of a development plan and institutional structures , limited administrative and managerial skills of personnel , dependence , to a large extent , on the Israeli systems , the inadequate technical condition of the Palestinian systems and limited financial resources .  
The advanced planning for procurement instituted in the current year and the annual budget cycle accepted in principle by the General Assembly should help to improve the situation , enabling the Secretariat to plan in advance for procurement so that most of the actions could be completed by the end of the financial period .

Since such claims result in additional and unintended financial obligations and often indeterminate liabilities , the Board recommends that precise legal agreements to establish mutual rights and obligations should be signed with all implementing agencies .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia until payment is effected .  
With respect to close liaison between UNIFEM and UNDP / BFA , the first quarterly meeting between UNDP / DOF and UNIFEM was held in June 1995 to review the financial statements of 31 December 1994 , received on 31 May 1995 , and the related comments by UNDP / DOF . Required actions regarding outstanding advances to executing agencies , cost-sharing and subtrust fund resources , and statements of unspent allocations were discussed , agreed on and are being implemented .  
Most recently , in 1993 , the Organization retained the services of a well-known travel consultant to draft a request for proposal , which contained stringent requirements concerning measurable performance standards and required that offers included a proposed budget for the travel agency to permit a better understanding of the financial considerations with a view to maximizing the monetary gain for the Organization .  
Until 1994 , the Fund 's advisory and custodial services had been contracted to one financial institution under two separate contracts , with the fees based on the market value of the Fund , but billed separately , at a combined rate of approximately 8.05 basis points ( 0.0805 per cent ) .  
The causes of the precarious financial situation were plain and followed the same pattern as in previous years , namely late or non-payment of assessed contributions for both the regular budget and peace-keeping operations ; delay between the approval of peace-keeping operations by the Security Council and the receipt of cash to pay for them ; and an increasing number of unfunded mandates .

Given the substantial financial implications involved in the current arrangements for additional war-risk insurance , referred to in paragraph 24 ( a ) ( ii ) , alternative arrangements should be sought with the utmost expediency ;  
As always , it is the entire package of adjustment measures , plus adequate debt relief , official financial support and a buoyancy in an open world economy that builds confidence in the private sector and charges up dynamic development processes .  The external debt situation of the transition economies is thus not covered in this report .  
While welcoming the meeting held in Tombouctou on 16 and 17 July 1995 between the Government of Mali and northern Mali 's development partners , the Ministers renewed their appeal to the entire international community to increase its material and financial support for the implementation of all the provisions of the National Pact and for the consolidation of the peace process under way in the country .  
Total arms expenditure , including money spent on developing advanced technologies for military purposes , has absorbed considerable human , material and financial resources .  
Cooperation with developing States for the purposes set out in this article shall include the provision of financial assistance , assistance relating to human resources development , technical assistance , transfer of technology , including through joint venture arrangements , and advisory and consultative services .  
The credit , when extended , is short term , and when commercial banks are involved , they usually extend such trade finance only to big established customers as part of bank-customer relationships .  In most developing countries , the institutional and financial capacity shortage has a particular impact on small and medium-sized exporters and on non-traditional exports ( defined as either new exports or those calling for medium-term credit ) .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Other steps included close cooperation to ensure that all the group 's financial sector operations were carried out in the context of a sound reform strategy ; explicit support by the group to privatization , through the provision of advisory services to Governments and the provision of finance for public enterprise restructuring and investments in privatized firms ; and the intensification of the group 's research on private sector issues .  
In view of the above , the XXth Postal Congress launched an appeal to Governments to provide the postal service with a statute and a modern management system that would guarantee it proper autonomy and adequate human and financial resources based on the notion of profitability .  
Through its collaboration with the regional agricultural credit associations , FAO encourages financial institutions to revise their approaches and restructure their operations to better serve private sector enterprises and to enable them to act as contacts for new , emerging grassroots ' financial intermediaries at the national level .  
In a series of communications addressed , during 1993-1994 , to all States as well as to the competent organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations system , including the international financial institutions and the regional development banks , the Secretary-General requested them to provide him , on a regular basis , with information on action taken or contemplated by them to alleviate the special economic problems of the affected States ( see A / 49 / 356 , para .  10 ) .  
Most important , however , remains the need to mobilize new and additional financial resources from all potential funding sources , in particular bilateral donors and also the regional development banks , with a view to mitigating , in an effective and timely manner , the adverse impact of the sanctions regime .  
The active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors should be encouraged , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , cooperatives , local community groups , non-governmental organizations , including women 's organizations and feminist groups , the media , religious groups , youth organizations and cultural groups , as well as financial and non-profit organizations .  
The ability of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women to monitor implementation of the Convention should be strengthened through the provision of human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations , including expert legal assistance and , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 49 / 164 and the decision made by the meeting of States parties to the Convention held in May 1995 , sufficient meeting time for the Committee .

Undertake to explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures , trade in arms and investment in arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to permit the possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development , in particular for the advancement of women ;  
In this context , special emphasis should be placed on ensuring that international financial institutions make the most effective use of existing financing facilities and establish additional ones , attracting capital investments in conditions of respect for the domestic legislation of each country and using efficient energy technologies mainly to support the execution of the projects that are necessary for our region in this sector .  
The free and orderly development of financial markets should also be promoted and mechanisms developed to bring about a more stable international financial system which would ensure that increased resources are available to its institutions and that the latter would be capable of detecting , in time , potential exchange-rate and financial crises , which negate the considerable efforts being made by our countries to achieve economic reform , liberalization and stability .  
Decides further that any exceptions to this rule may be made by the body concerned only if the statements are to serve as bases for discussion and if , after hearing a statement of the relevant financial implications , the body decides that one or more statements in extenso may be included in the summary record , or reproduced as separate documents or as annexes to authorized documents " .  
We believe that the formulation of this concept , including aspects of financial , material and technical support by the international community for the peace process in Liberia , requires a realistic , weighted approach based on the provisions of previous Security Council resolutions .  
In their search for new opportunities and markets , organized criminal groups were ready to make sizeable investments in both equipment and human resources and were willing to bring their huge financial power to bear , in addition to using other more violent methods , for eliminating competition .  
The decisive condition for their realization is the spontaneous initiative of individuals , first of all representatives of cultural and public life and of youth , with the financial assistance of national and international organizations and foundations .  
Decides further that any exceptions to this rule may be made by the body concerned only if the statements are to serve as bases for discussion and if , after hearing a statement of the relevant financial implications , the body decides that one or more statements in extenso may be included in the summary record , or reproduced as separate documents or as annexes to authorized documents " .  
In line with its support for General Assembly resolution 49 / 9 , the Islamic Republic of Iran rejects the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba and considers it a violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , lacking acceptable justification in current international affairs .  
The first question raises macroeconomic issues concerning domestic saving and the net transfer of foreign saving to developing countries ; the second question raises microeconomic issues concerning the role of government and the financial sector in intermediating between savers and investors .  
Policy makers in some developing countries have thus begun to focus on the disparate characteristics of different types of private financial inflows and many now question the wisdom of early and complete liberalization of the capital account in international transactions .  Meanwhile , in some of the developed countries , the prospective role of development assistance itself is being re-examined .  
Fads in policy design have repeatedly swept across segments of the community of policy advisers , only to be followed by reassessments after unanticipated difficulties have arisen .  No single model of financial development applies equally well in all institutional , cultural and technological situations .  
The Committee welcomes the financial management model of UNOPS by which administrative expenditures are planned and monitored based on a continuous review of the demand for services , as well as the actual programme delivery figures and resulting support income earned ;  
Finally , from a financial point of view , the team found that the Organization : ( i ) faces potential risk in the form of unrecorded liabilities ; ( ii ) is potentially wasting considerable sums of money owing , inter alia , to the lack of adequate asset controls ; and ( iii ) faces potential risk in terms of third-party liability because of uncertain insurance coverage in cases where troops are deployed / rotated under letters of assist .  
NULLAlthough special programmes and specialized financial institutions are important , their limited coverage means that a sustained impact on the problem of underfunding of micro-enterprises and SMEs calls for more active involvement of commercial banks , which tend to exclude this portion of the population because of the conviction that it is too costly to service .  
NULLThe objective of this undertaking was to draw policy recommendations from an in-depth review of the existing financial systems in African countries , including the current traditional systems and practices of capital formation at the local level , with a view to improving financial systems in those countries through the adoption of practical and realistic measures focused specifically on development of the private sector . 
The formal financial system in Africa has faced a number of internal and external constraints , including inadequate technical and managerial capacity , antiquated legal and regulatory frameworks , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pronounced government intervention , that not only hampered its growth but actually caused significant disintermediation in a number of countries .  
In the process , the intermediation mechanism grows more varied and complex , ranging from the informal financial system comprising all legal financial activities outside the orbit of institutional and officially regulated finance , to a more complex modern system , supervised by a central monetary authority , that facilitates the transfer of large quantities of money within and between countries .  
NULLThe primary stage of financial intermediation is dominated by a combination of a large informal sector where transactions between lenders and borrowers are direct and personal , a currency-creating authority ( a central bank or a currency board ) , and a limited number of deposit-receiving and credit institutions like the commercial banks .  
This stage of financial intermediation requires the satisfaction of only a few simple preconditions : the existence of a rudimentary regulatory and supervisory framework over the takers of deposits , and a minimum of institutional and technical capacity to carry out the currency-issuing and credit-extending functions , and to collect and interpret limited monetary information .  
An apparent alienation of the formal financial system from indigenous economic actors , especially in the rural areas , and in the urban informal sector and small-scale enterprises .  
Five features of these transactions are noteworthy : reciprocity ( " I help you , you help me , when in need " ) ; insignificant transaction costs ; the open-ended ( no fixed maturity ) nature of many of these financial contracts ; the informality of screening devices ( personal knowledge of borrowers ) used in making loans ; and the informal sanctions ( such as social shunning of delinquents ) employed to enforce contracts .  
NULLThe basic purpose of the proposed policy initiative would be to exploit to the maximum , and in a cost-effective manner , the savings and credit potential of the informal and semi-formal financial system ; to strengthen its ability to mobilize small savings from relatively marginal sections of population ; and to encourage decentralized lending , that is , in areas largely untouched by the formal financial system .  
They also have the potential , as demonstrated in Burkina Faso , Cameroon and Niger and a number of other African countries , to extend their reach to a larger number of depositors and borrowers , adapt the nature and size of their operations , and foster links with the formal financial system without losing their identity or forgoing their current comparative advantage over the formal system .  
NULLThe policy initiative should begin with national efforts to seek to determine the overall magnitude of operations and the role of the institutions in the informal sector , to understand how they work and how sets of unwritten rules and social conventions have guided and sustained them against risks inherent in financial transactions .  
The content and complexity of these regulations must be appropriate to the existing degree of financial intermediation , neither so restrictive as to prevent competition and development of innovative institutions or practices , nor so permissive as to allow the establishment and operation of shadowy and shaky financial institutions .  
Similarity of regulatory and prudential framework may also be desirable , however , even for countries not forming part of a common monetary area , in order to avoid " competitive " inducements for the entry of foreign banks , as well as to permit a greater intercountry / interbank flow of funds conducive to the emergence of geographically wider financial markets in Africa .  
For this purpose , the central bank should promote the establishment , on a volunteer basis , of a critical mass of primary dealers who must satisfy certain minimum criteria ( such as observing minimum capital standards ) to possess the financial capacity to support the government securities market , and encourage competition .  
In the interests of promoting regional integration and the emergence of wider financial markets in Africa , as well as to avoid costly " competitive " inducements to foreign entry , it is also desirable that countries adopt similar regulatory and prudential frameworks ;  
NULLPursuant to General Assembly resolution 36 / 151 , voluntary contributions to the Fund from Governments , non-governmental organizations and private individuals are to be distributed through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been severely violated as a result of torture and to relatives of such victims .  
NULLCooperation with developing States for the purposes set out in this article shall include the provision of financial assistance , assistance relating to human resources development , technical assistance , transfer of technology , including through joint venture arrangements , and advisory and consultative services .  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
The implementation of a sound macroeconomic policy framework is seen as a key determinant of future financial stability and rapid economic recovery .  
As such , the programme has been unable to provide any substantial financial assistance to meet capital assistance needs which have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries which are committed to these ends but which face economic hardship due to economic problems , crisis or transition .  
Such support might be facilitated by , inter alia , the substantial supplementing of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights ; the establishment of a separate , complementary fund for capital assistance in the field of human rights ; or encouraging increased support from development agencies and funds and financial institutions for financial and capital assistance for human rights and the rule of law .  
NULLWe recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society .  
Technical and financial cooperation is still needed from the international community , however , failing which there is little likelihood of consolidation of economic growth , reconstruction , improved living conditions for the poorest sectors of the population , peace , democracy and the functioning of democratic institutions .  
I am convinced that , notwithstanding the acute financial crisis currently facing the Organization , the provision of additional resources to UNOMIL , at a level that is modest by comparison with peace-keeping operations elsewhere , is justified by the hope that the Abuja Agreement at last offers a chance of ending the cruel war in Liberia and alleviating the terrible suffering it has caused .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
The seven major industrialized countries and other international monetary and financial organizations had allocated nearly US $ 4-billion in support of Ukraine 's efforts ; however , total foreign investment needs were calculated at close to US $ 40-billion .  
Besides , foreign markets have been lost , the domestic market has contracted , capital and other foreign financial transactions have been interrupted , the economy has been decapitalized and the country is devoid of resources for simple reproduction , let alone for development investment .  
The agenda for development should underscore the anachronistic nature of the current international economic and financial system which , each year , deprived developing countries of over $ 500-billion in economic opportunities due to restrictions or unequal access to world trade , labour and capital markets and " allowed " a net transfer of resources of $ 50-billion from the poor countries to the wealthy countries .  
The tendency for the Bretton Woods institutions to become increasingly involved in direct economic management in the developing countries , instead of playing a role of global governance was cause for great concern , particularly since they were often incapable of redressing the imbalances in world monetary and financial markets , which usually operated against weak economies .  
Governments in such regions can do much to remedy intrinsic factors that contribute to that unattractiveness but they will need more help to enable them to meet the financial requirements of sustainable development , for which genuine new and innovative sources will be required , including sources in the developed world .  
International legal and related efforts in the field of environment continue to see rapid development , constituting a substantial framework of legal , administrative , economic , financial and technical measures to prevent , control and reduce the adverse impact of human activities on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems .  
In addition , the Commission requested the Executive Secretary of ECA and the Director-General of UNIDO to hold consultative meetings of sponsoring countries and organizations with indigenous and external potential investors as well as African and non-African financial institutions , for the purpose of identifying , formulating and undertaking feasibility studies and financing of specific bankable projects with basic industries .  
Of particular significance among these are the facilitation of technical and financial support for developing country parties , as required by the Convention and called for by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 195 , as well as the role played by the secretariat in coordinating the in-depth reviews of the national communications received from annex I parties .  
In addition , foreign markets have been lost , the domestic market has contracted , capital and other foreign financial transactions have been interrupted , the economy has been decapitalized and the country is devoid of resources for simple production , let alone for development investment .  
Emphasizes the need to broaden appropriate cooperation among monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to encourage the establishment of preventive consultations between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
Expressing also its concern that serious external and domestic financial constraints have been experienced by developing countries that have continued to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion ,  
Also stresses the urgent need for creditor countries , private banks and lending institutions to expand their efforts to address the commercial debt of debt-distressed developing countries , and to extend appropriate new financial support , as well as provide additional and innovative measures , to enable these countries to achieve sustained economic growth and development ;  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
Supports the treatment accorded to Nicaragua in the light of its continuing exceptional circumstances , so that the international community and financial institutions can incorporate that treatment into programmes to support the country 's economic recovery and social reconstruction ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand fund-raising channels , to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries to enable them to implement their national workplans and projects , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malaria vaccines as a priority ;  
Recalling the commitments made by the developed countries in various international conferences and summits held during the 1990s to provide adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ,  
Noting that the peace dividend has not materialized in the form of additional financial flows to developing countries , and expressing the need for the reallocation by developed countries of resources freed from military purposes arising from the end of the Cold War towards productive development purposes in support of existing international commitments for development ,  
For their part , Member States will pursue and take responsibility for reforming that system .  NULLWe recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society .  
Given current financial constraints and the fact that a limited number of persons had access to the seminars organized under the Programme , audiovisual tapes on various subjects of international law were a convenient tool to place at the disposal of educational institutions of States , especially developing States .  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
As demonstrated by the preparatory process , the implementation of innovative approaches for strengthening institutions and capacity-building do not necessarily require new institutional arrangements , but rather a reorientation of largely existing human , technical and financial resources within a coherent and internally consistent framework .  
Also emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic recovery and growth of the world economy , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities such as triangular funding arrangements and private sector funding ;  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 and 49 / 9 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
To be consistent with the Assembly 's responsibility for financial matters , procedures were established for the proper authorization of such unforeseen and extraordinary expenses ; this took the form of an annual , and later biennial , resolution adopted by the Assembly on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses .  
all national and international policies and measures , in particular those of an economic and financial character , should be judged in this light and accepted only in so far as they may be held to promote and not to hinder the achievement of this fundamental objective " .  
These obstacles must be analysed in the context of international political and economic relations characterized by the globalization of the economy and in a specific historical context marked by the end of the cold war and East-West confrontation , the emergence of regional economic groupings and the concentration of economic , financial and technological power in the hands of a limited number of countries .  
As part of the reforms which should , in the experts ' view , be introduced to improve the international economic environment , reference was made to the urgent need to reform the international monetary system in order to correct current distortions and discourage speculative financial transactions .  
Emphasizing the importance of cooperation and international solidarity in supporting the efforts being made by the peoples and Governments of Central America for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace , and the need to strengthen the new programme of cooperation and economic , technical and financial assistance for Central America in the light of the new situation in the region ,  
Supports the treatment accorded to Nicaragua in the light of its continuing exceptional circumstances , so that the international community and financial institutions can incorporate that treatment into programmes to support the country 's economic recovery and social reconstruction ;  
Thus , according to the fund type and the type of transaction being processed , the system reviews a number of parameters , selects those that are applicable and is then able to choose the correct posting rule to be applied after the financial document is approved or amended , i.e . , the accounting entries are automatically recorded in the accounting ledger tables .  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America ;  
In the light of the improving situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the critical financial situation of the United Nations , I have accepted the recommendations of my Special Representative and the Force Commander that only essential forces should be retained to implement UNPROFOR 's mandate pending a transition to other arrangements . 
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Recommendation 1 : Wherever United Nations system organizations desire to enhance cooperative relationships with the multilateral financial institutions , their executive heads and the governing bodies responsible for operational activities for development should make a meaningful commitment to increase the competitiveness of their programmes .  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation , and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
As mentioned in the paragraph on the status of Iraq contained in its report to the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , 1 / the Committee on Contributions stated that some of its members were of the opinion that the waiver of Article 19 for Iraq should be recommended , whereas other members were of the view that the Committee did not have adequate statistical information on the current economic and financial situation of Iraq .  
We recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society . 
The assignment of additional resources to a number of priority areas ( political affairs , international and regional cooperation for development , human rights , humanitarian affairs and internal monitoring ) was an important practical step , because the focusing of resources should make it easier to achieve the targets which had been set , while taking account of the financial situation of the United Nations .  
In that connection , the incapacity of the newly independent States which had emerged from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to discharge their financial obligations was attributable not only to their extremely difficult social and economic situation , but above all to the fact that the rates of assessment recommended by the Committee on Contributions in 1992 were unfair and excessive compared with their real capacity to pay .  
He stressed the need to reach a consensus on a fair and equitable apportionment of the expenses of the Organization and reiterated that the real capacity of Member States to pay was the fundamental criterion for determining a scale which would be acceptable to all and would help to strengthen the financial basis of the Organization and of the United Nations system .  
At the end of the 12-month period provided in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates will be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable will remain recorded in the Special Account until payment is effected ;  
The Heads of State and delegations considered it imperative that the search for peace in the Great Lakes region should be accompanied by coordinated and concrete actions by the international community to mobilize financial resources so as to bring economic and social development to the region .  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Whether it was decided to set up a trust fund , to have recourse to the existing international financial institutions , to non-governmental organizations or to bilateral assistance , the key point was to agree on specific measures making it possible to assist States affected by the sanctions .  
the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
that the international community should continue to give strong support to the efforts of the developing countries to solve their grave economic and social problems as well as to promote a favourable climate for private financial flows through the creation of a favourable international economic environment ,  
concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
We recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society . 
stressed the need for strengthened international cooperation which should be reflected in appropriate financial and technological resources to enable developing countries to implement their national plans .  
tendency to impose unrealistic standards and requirements on the industries and products of developing countries and to propose or adopt financial policies which were detrimental to those countries ' economic and social development , under the pretext of environmental protection , was therefore inconsistent with the spirit and provisions of environmental agreements , including the Framework Convention on Climate Change .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
the imbalance between the increasing responsibilities that the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council had given that Branch and the institutional and financial means at its disposal could not be ignored , especially in the light of the growing crime rate , which was directly related to the tremendous corrupting power and the increasingly sophisticated methods of criminal organizations .  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America ;  
also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation , and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to increase its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand fund-raising channels , to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries to enable them to implement their national work plans and projects , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malaria vaccines as a priority ;  
outbreak of hostilities in 1991 interrupted critical administrative and financial reforms within the Croatian Ministry of Health as it sought to end chronic financial deficits and increase efficiency by shifting resources from curative and secondary clinical care to primary and preventive services .  
There is a heavy financial burden on the Government of Croatia to meet capital requirements in order to strengthen its infrastructure , as its current military-industrial complex is absorbing existing capital , thus preventing the investment necessary to achieve reconstruction and the restoration of infrastructure and other services . 
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities such as triangular funding arrangements and private sector funding ;

Reaffirms that the effective implementation of the Programme of Action will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on population and development and intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Programme of Action , in order to ensure that population and development objectives and goals are met ;

Urgently appeals to all States , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue to provide , on a priority basis and as far as conditions on the ground permit , all possible financial , technical and material assistance for the restoration of the basic services and the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the voluntary , safe and secure return of refugees and internally displaced persons , and appeals to the international financial and development institutions to assist in the planning of the reconstruction of Afghanistan ;  
All those activities required financial support on an orderly , stable and predictable basis , and it was therefore critical that donor countries demonstrate the political commitment to provide the funds promised and thereby to reach the objectives established during the triennial review . 
the geographic coverage of operational activities had been extended to the CIS countries and their scope now also included administrative reform , the defence of human rights and elections , and financial resources therefore should have been increased accordingly .

Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;

the geographic coverage of operational activities had been extended to the CIS countries and their scope now also included administrative reform , the defence of human rights and elections , and financial resources therefore should have been increased accordingly .  
At a meeting of ACC held the previous month in New York , all the Executive Heads of the organizations of the United Nations system had expressed deep awareness of the need for improved performance management and increased productivity at a time of increasing demands and scarce financial resources .  
emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic recovery and growth of the world economy , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure the reactivation and acceleration of growth and development in the least developed countries and enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;

Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible , and also to ensure that the international framework of action for the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty , once adopted , be transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible and also to ensure that the documents related to the Year and the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty , once adopted , are transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
Also invites all other relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , in particular , the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions and the World Trade Organization , to contribute to the special session , and requests the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session ;  
Also invites all other relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions and the World Trade Organization , to contribute to the special session , and requests the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session ;  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
achievement of sustainable solutions required national , regional and international solidarity , which meant that financial and human resources exceeding the capacity of a single country or small group of countries had to be mobilized .  
part of the enhancement of " the capacity of the Organization and of the United Nations system to support the ongoing follow-up to the Conference in the most integrated and effective way , including human and financial requirements " ( para . 32 ) , the Secretary-General is requested to ensure the more effective functioning of the Division for the Advancement of Women in order to carry out all the tasks foreseen for it in the Platform for Action by , inter alia , providing sufficient human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations .  
The Secretary-General stated in his report of 23 November 1995 ( S / 1995 / 987 ) , that in view of the improving situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the critical financial situation of the United Nations , that he had accepted the recommendations of his Special Representative and the Force Commander that only essential forces should be retained to implement the mandate of UNPROFOR pending a transition to other arrangements .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
situation was critical in certain border provinces , which , overburdened by the provision of enormous financial , material and human resources in the fight against such criminal activities , should receive the support of the international community .  
Requests the Secretary-General to make available additional human and financial resources to enhance the capability of the High Commissioner and of the Centre to fulfil effectively their respective mandates and their ability to carry out mandated operational activities and to coordinate efficiently with other relevant parts of the United Nations system on logistical and administrative questions , having due regard to the need to finance and implement activities of the United Nations related to development ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
Invites Member States , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue and intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda , particularly in the areas of the administration of justice , and welcomes the contributions made , including those at the Round Table Conference at Geneva and its mid-term review , and urges States and donor agencies to fulfil their earlier commitments ;  
Also decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 2,618,600 dollars gross ( 2,217,800 dollars net ) for the period from 1 October 1994 to 30 June 1995 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,966,500 United States dollars gross ( 1,858,600 dollars net ) , for the period from 14 January to 15 May 1995 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 378,600 United States dollars gross ( 373,800 dollars net ) for the period from 16 December 1994 to 16 June 1995 ;  
Renews its appeal to all Governments , especially the Governments of developed countries and other Governments in a position to do so , as well as to international and regional financial institutions , to make substantial contributions to the voluntary fund established by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 180 for the purpose of financing preparatory activities for the Conference and supporting developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , in participating fully and effectively in the Conference and its preparatory process ;  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
than ever before it was necessary to observe the essence of " partnership " and " interdependence " in international relations with a view to providing substantial support to structural adjustment programmes in the least developed countries on terms adapted to their needs , as well as additional financial assistance to enable them to alleviate poverty , protect the environment and carry out social programmes .  
that had to be complemented by action aimed at improving the terms of trade for the least developed countries , channelling foreign direct investment in a meaningful way and providing financial and technical assistance to develop human resources and build economic and social institutions .  
Requests the Government of Burundi to continue its efforts geared towards the achievement of national reconciliation and the lasting maintenance of peace , inter alia , through adherence to the principles of the Convention on Governance , provisions that are essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of humanitarian aid and economic , financial , material and technical assistance to the people of Burundi ;  
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to continue its efforts to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
downward trend recorded over the last three budgets and the absence of links between financial commitments and programming had aroused concerns and led to questioning as to whether environmental concerns had been recognized as having equal importance with social and economic concerns .  The Governing Council had again called on all Governments to contribute voluntarily to the Environment Fund in time to permit implementation of the planned activities .  
With respect to the recommendation of the Advisory Committee that the conversion of some temporary posts to permanent posts should be deferred , he said it was difficult to demand a high level of efficiency from the Centre when significant new mandates had been assigned to it without commensurate human and financial resources .  
considered that the main cause of the serious financial situation of the United Nations , which required a global and balanced solution , was the fact that certain Member States lacked the political will to discharge the binding financial obligations which they had assumed upon subscribing to the Charter .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Suspiciously enough , these events come together at one point : the passing by the United States Congress of the infamous piece of legislation aimed at definitively blockading Cuba from the rest of the world , when over 35 years of a cruel and ever-worsening economic , commercial and financial blockade have failed and has been condemned year after year by this sovereign Assembly .  
The 1990s have been a decade of political and economic upheaval throughout the world , and there has been an increasing tendency towards democratization and the participation of non-governmental actors in development , with a particularly strong emphasis on the need for good governance and for sound financial and economic policies at the national level and a greater reliance on market forces and on the private sector as basic requirements of development .  
Specific requirements should be identified for bilateral and multilateral cooperation in capacity-building and the training of civil servants in the areas of economic and financial management , the creation of jobs , the eradication of poverty , the provision of adequate criminal justice infrastructures and environmental protection .  
However , if and when the financial target of the 20 / 20 initiative is attained , and even if more donors reach or surpass the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance , as the Netherlands did long ago , it will only have the hoped-for effect if there is a sufficiently competent and honest government machinery to administer these important funds .  
The State was typical of the nineteenth century : a judge and gendarme liberal State assuming the essential duties of national defence , internal security , foreign relations , basic financial activity and justice .  
Regarding public finance , we strengthened the financial institutions for State financial programming and introduced new budgetary norms to secure investments in projects that are duly formulated and coordinated by our central planning body .  
Streamlining governmental machinery , increasing its productivity and reducing costs , improving economic and financial management , promoting the interaction between the private and public sectors , and stimulating the participation of the various actors in this process have been at the forefront of recent efforts for public administration reforms in Austria .  
The International Tribunal set up to identify agents of genocide living abroad has not been effective , as it has been crippled by organizational , financial and operational obstacles .  
At the same time , it is necessary to recognize what the Secretary General 's report points out : that the challenges which Governments worldwide face in establishing a framework of public administration and a financial system for sustainable economic development are not just domestic influences , but are also unpredictable external factors .  
In addition to paying tribute to the people of Haiti in its ongoing search for a strong and lasting democracy , justice and economic prosperity , the General Assembly reaffirms the international community 's commitment to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , with a view to supporting social and economic development efforts and to strengthening Haitian institutions that must administer justice and ensure democracy , the observance of human rights , political stability and economic development .  
The view was expressed that , for financial reasons and in the interest of improved efficiency and effectiveness , subsidiary bodies that had been granted an exception to meet away from their established headquarters should be invited to review their need for the exception in the light of the current situation of their work .  
The desire of a number of countries , including the Russian Federation ( which as a result of the imposition of sanctions has suffered and continues to suffer very substantial material and financial losses ) to elaborate practical ways and means to prevent the negative consequences of sanctions or , at least , to keep them to a minimum , are therefore fully justified .  
He also drew attention to some remaining difficulties such as the possible additional resources that Conference Services would need for the editing , translation and printing of the supplement , the heavy burden that the concentration of the review work within a single division would place on that division and the priority to be given to other urgent responsibilities in the current period of financial crisis and diminishing resources .  
The main objective of the review was to obtain assurance that the assumptions used in the programme budget were based on sound financial and economic principles and to suggest refinements in budgetary techniques and modifications in format with a view to achieving realistic and transparent budgetary proposals .  
Funds received or pledges recorded as receivable , attributable to future financial periods and , therefore , not credited to the income account of the period reported on .  
As a result of our examination , we are of the opinion that the financial statements present fairly the financial position of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research as at 31 December 1995 and the results of its operations for the year then ended ; that they were prepared in accordance with the stated accounting policies which were applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding financial period , and that the transactions were in accordance with the Financial Regulations and the relevant legislative authority .  
It added that apart from the total amount of financial contributions to the Habitat II process arising directly and indirectly from the contractor 's activities , the valuable contributions of the firm to the overall preparations and success of Habitat II , including its role in raising awareness about the Conference among prominent and influential circles of a Member State , had been substantial .  
Our Organization , which was designed to respond to both global challenges and to the needs of its Member States , will not be able to play its double role in the coming century unless it can count on a sound , solid and stable financial basis .  
With its financial resources and groups of experts , the United Nations system can assist the countries of the South to overcome their disadvantaged position and succeed in their efforts for timely regional and global integration , in the context of an economic , trade , scientific and technological race on a global scale .  
A number of societies are seriously threatened by increasing external debt , the instability of the international financial system , persistent unemployment , intractable poverty and increasingly destructive waves of crime and corruption .  
There should also be a significant increase in transfers of long-term development finance to developing countries by , first , attaining the existing official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by mobilizing new and additional sources of finance ; secondly , creating a global fund by mobilizing resources using new and innovative measures , such as the Tobin tax and environment-related levies from which Governments in both the North and the South would benefit ; and , thirdly , introducing measures to stabilize the international monetary system and financial markets .  
Furthermore , these leaders unanimously called for in-depth reflection so that we might enter the twenty-first century with a restructured , reinvigorated Organization , equipped with the necessary human , material and financial resources to more effectively accomplish the lofty mission of an Organization that harmonizes the complementary efforts of Member States in order to achieve new goals in a context of freedom and active solidarity . 
In spite of the importance of the administrative and financial reform of the United Nations , its specialized agencies and other organs , the influential Powers have not given the question of collective security adequate attention with a view to developing ways and means to preserve international peace and security .  
It is difficult to persevere in the face of harsh and unjustified criticism and insufficient financial resources while engaged in the complex task of revitalizing the United Nations to meet the needs of a world in rapid transformation .  
Despite this difficult situation , Zaire has made it a point of honour to pursue its democratic process , committing itself to reestablishing the authority of the State , rebuilding the basic infrastructure , improving the country 's economic , financial and monetary situation , ensuring the security of persons and property and observing human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
We need to enforce existing international instruments , promote cooperation and allow the United Nations to play a more central and coordinating role in developing appropriate machinery for bringing together political will and financial and technological resources to guarantee results .  
The dynamic and extraordinary manner in which Mr . Boutros Boutros-Ghali has accomplished his mission as Secretary-General in difficult circumstances of financial constraints and wars within and among Nations , and his fostering of social and economic development , has earned our sincere gratitude .  
We wish to stress the urgent need for the international community , particularly donor countries and international financial institutions , to adopt an effective , comprehensive and equitable development-oriented and durable solution to the debt problem of developing countries .  
To complement these efforts , we make a special appeal to the international community , and particularly to the multilateral financial institutions , to adopt concrete measures to effect a drastic reduction of external indebtedness of least developed countries and other severely indebted developing countries .  
While it may be true that the existing financial crisis is primarily a crisis of payment , there is no denying the fact that there is unnecessary waste being generated here , whether in regard to the duplication of work detail , the excessive copying of documents , the scheduling of numerous meetings destined to accomplish nothing or to a myriad of other undesirables .  
A vast programme was set up in the economic and financial sphere that included financial stabilization measures , a State audit , monitoring of civil servants and a recovery of State movable property and real estate .  
That programme , which is supported by the international financial institutions with which we have worked out clear-cut modalities for negotiation and cooperation , will enable us better to meet an economic and social future that will be more promising and that will better favour the integration of the Haitian economy into the world scene .  
The efforts of the organs of the United Nations system engaged in providing technical and advisory assistance to the least developed countries , particularly the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) , need to be supplemented adequately by the Bretton Woods institutions and regional financial institutions to arrest and reverse the declining economic and social situation of the least developed countries .  
Negative economic growth rates , persistent imbalances in the commercial and financial fields , increased transitional or structural unemployment , and an absence of coordination in exchange rates and trade policies these are some of the problems connected with the system of the developed world which have an adverse impact on the developing countries .  
However , that is not because , apart from current financial constraints , the Organization has not allocated millions of dollars to peacekeeping operations ; it is because it has not come to grips with the real causes of conflicts , and because artificial solutions have so often been imposed which , far from fostering a negotiated and objective settlement of conflicts , have been dictated by hegemonic interests . 
The Group is pleased that the Commission adopted a resolution that called for the implementation of agreed measures to eradicate poverty and for strengthened international cooperation to that end , and which also called on the international community to mobilize additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable to contribute to poverty eradication .  
We in Japan believe that such genuine development can only be achieved on the basis of a comprehensive approach to development which would involve activities ranging over the economic and social fields , such as financial resource mobilization through official development assistance , investment and trade , and human resource mobilization through social integration of people by means of ensuring basic education , primary health care and empowerment of all groups of people in society .  
Also proclaimed is the critical importance of the cooperation , support and contributions of the international community , the United Nations , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society including private citizens for social development .  
Thus while it acknowledged that individual countries bear the primary responsibility for the attainment of the goals of the conference , it also recognized that the support of the international community as a whole including of the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , bilateral donors , non-governmental organizations and all actors of civil society will be crucial if we are to realize all the objectives of the conference .  
We may recall that , although the Social Summit acknowledged that the primary responsibility to attain the goals set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action rests with national Governments , it also emphasized the importance of support and contributions from the international community , the United Nations and multilateral financial institutions .  
On the home front , supporting the private and informal sectors , promotion of self-employment , provision of credit facilities to the unemployed , encouraging the creation of volunteer organizations including grass-roots financial organizations , investment in training and education programmes , optimal use of resources such as land and water , expansion of labour-intensive economic activities and a focus on the service sector are among the necessary first steps .  
The European Union has taken a leading role in the strengthening of regulatory regimes , including in the establishment of the nuclear safety account , administered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , the G 24 coordinating mechanism , the European Union 's Poland-Hungary Aid for the Reconstruction of the Economy ( PHARE ) and Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States ( TACIS ) programmes , the European Atomic Energy Community loan facility , coordinated support from the international financial institutions for the energy sector , and bilateral cooperation projects .  
Kuwait believes that there are several countries that have proven , through their relations with the United Nations , that they are capable of assuming the main responsibilities of maintaining international peace and security and of assisting in achieving the United Nations objectives in the political , economic , social and cultural fields through their participation in peacekeeping operations and their considerable financial contributions to the various budgets of these operations and to the regular United Nations budget .  
The Government of Benin keenly hopes to benefit further from the assistance and support of the entire international community , the United Nations system , multilateral financial institutions , non-governmental organizations and all the other elements of civil society throughout the world in order to conclude successfully its programme of building a State truly based on the rule of law and a prosperous nation in which all the citizens of Benin will soon share a minimum level of well-being .  
In an international environment characterized by the exacerbation of commercial , financial and cultural competition , in which international aid is becoming scarcer , strengthening the endogenous capacities of Africa is a healthy imperative to allow our continent to take its destiny into its own hands .  
The full economic and social utilization of those resources for the benefit of the peoples , to uplift them and create and maintain a better way of life , has been retarded by the severe impact of external debt and , concomitantly , debt-servicing costs , declining levels of official development assistance , reduced financial flows for investment and for industrial , business and commercial development , increasing barriers to trade and impaired access to the markets of the developed countries of the world .  
Despite their commitment to sustained economic reforms , African countries ' experiences have been far from pleasant in terms of economic growth because of the increasing trend towards globalization of the world economy , the unfavourable external environment , poor access to the external market , declining returns on their commodities , and the unpredictability of the financial system .  
It has been acknowledged by the United Nations , by the specialized agencies and by the entire international community as a whole as exceptional in terms of urgencies and opportunities , which calls for an exceptional mobilization of political will , and of human , technological and financial resources in order to speed up implementation of the New Agenda for the remainder of the decade and beyond , in later years , in line with the draft resolution recommended in section IV of document A / 51 / 48 .  
Mwakawago ( United Republic of Tanzania ) : First of all , I would like to express my delegation 's appreciation for the Secretary-General 's report , contained in document A / 51 / 355 dated 13 September 1996 , concerning agenda item 27 , entitled Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
Grave concerns have been expressed that despite the worldwide call for an end to the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba , this embargo not only continues but has been further strengthened and extended since the Helms-Burton Act was promulgated in March this year .  
Seemingly intractable , age-old problems have witnessed dramatic developments , stability and economic development .  As my Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated , the Government of Angola is profoundly concerned by the difficult social and economic situation prevailing in the Republic of Cuba as a result of the financial and economic blockade imposed on that member of the General Assembly .  
We have worked together in political , economic , commercial , financial , scientific , technical , educational and cultural areas .  
It should be unconscionable that financial flows to Africa remain so low despite renewed commitments by the international community to the contrary , and even more so when the majority of African countries have undertaken difficult and unpopular structural adjustment programmes that have marginalized the poor further , depleted natural resources and degraded the environment .  
The international community should therefore lend , as before , moral and methodological support , as well as economic , financial and other assistance which would allow the Governments of new or restored democracies to proceed with bold steps to create a thriving market economy and a democratic system and to alleviate the social costs sustained in the process .  
The draft resolution also reaffirms the continuing need for practical measures to mitigate the negative impact of the sanctions on the affected States by supporting their financial stabilization , developing the transport and communications infrastructure , promoting trade and increasing their active involvement in the post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation of the region .  
We support the conclusion contained in this report that new and additional financial resources from all potential funding sources , especially at the bilateral and regional levels , are necessary to address a variety of persisting economic problems of the affected States , in particular the long-term effects of sanctions on their economies .  
We should study that document in depth in order to determine the extent to which the mandates established by Member States have been carried out and to enable Member States to establish common priorities in the context of the major political , economic , social administrative and financial issues on the agenda of the Organization .  
In strengthening and modernizing the United Nations , the emphasis has to be on enhancing legitimacy , addressing inequities in decision-making processes and promoting efficiency and effectiveness better to meet the changing , complex needs of Members . The ultimate objective of reform can not be reduced to cutting costs or just addressing the current financial crisis .  
The General Assembly also called on developed countries to refrain from threats to impose commercial and financial restrictions , blockades , embargoes , and other economic sanctions on developing countries , because such practices violate the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and international bilateral and multilateral commitments .  
It is precisely because of our recognition of the specific and peculiar problems faced by the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , most of which are small island Territories that suffer from impediments created by the interplay of such factors as economic and geographic size , isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , lack of technological and financial resources and so on , including problems of accessibility to international credit and markets , that the international community should give specific priority and attention to the process of decolonization affecting the peoples of those Territories .  
The draft resolution before the Assembly recognizes the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development .  
The suffering they inflict upon civilian populations , their detrimental effects on economic and social development , especially in areas infested with landmines , and the hefty financial burdens , as well as the technological limitations involved in their detection and de-activation , are undeniable . 
The presentation of Uruguay 's initial report ( CRC / C / 3 / Add . 37 ) at the latest session of the Committee on the Rights of the Child had provided an opportunity for a constructive dialogue which had demonstrated the priority now accorded to children by the Government of Uruguay in its political programme to promote public and private activities carried out with the financial aid of the international community . 
Requests improved annual reporting on financial flows , including allocations / expenditures , based on consistent criteria and related to the costed elements of the Programme of Action , including a clear account of levels and trends of funding by source ( bilateral , multilateral ( both core and non-core ) and private funds , domestic allocations and the like ) ;  
Urges Governments to promote and attain the goals of eradicating illiteracy , universal and equitable access to quality education , and the highest standard of physical and mental health , and to encourage international organizations , in particular the international financial institutions , to support these objectives and to integrate them into policy programmes and operations , as appropriate ;  
Calls upon the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including , as mutually agreed , on concessional and grant terms ;  
Invites all relevant specialized agencies , funds , programmes and related organizations of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , to strengthen and adjust their activities , programmes and strategies , as appropriate , with a view to achieving the overall goal of eradicating poverty , meeting the basic human needs of all and promoting self-reliance and community-based initiatives , through , inter alia , financial and technical support to developing countries in their efforts to translate all measures , recommendations and commitments into operational and concrete programmes , projects and activities ;  
Also calls upon the international community to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including ( , as mutually agreed , ) on concessional and grant terms ;  
Additional financial resources obtained through established means - including increased and dependable official development assistance ( ODA ) , better mobilization of domestic resources and greater foreign direct investment - are called for .  
The Council acknowledged the need to facilitate access for developing countries to energy-efficient technologies and research , and called upon the international community , including developed countries , to make technologies and financial resources available to the developing countries to enable them to fully develop their potential capability in the field of new and renewable sources of energy , including their vast hydropower resources .  
Therefore , paragraph 4 of the draft resolution stated that the General Assembly noted with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General on the problem of indebtedness , stressed that non-payment of undisputed debts reflected badly on the entire diplomatic community , reaffirmed that non-compliance with contractual obligations could not be justified or condoned , and endorsed the proposals and procedures on the issue of financial indebtedness set out in annex II to the current report of the Committee .  
Many countries reported that they had established national TCDC focal points , but that their activities were constrained owing to insufficient staff , financial resources , coordination within the Government and understanding of TCDC .  
The idea of triangular funding , by which the financial resources of developed countries could be used to acquire the appropriate technical resources of developing countries in order to meet the needs of other developing countries , received universal endorsement from all delegations .  
Stressing the importance of chapter VI of annex II to the report of the Beijing Conference , he said that it was essential that adequate financial resources should be made available at the international level , particularly for small island developing States which had only limited economic capacities , for the implementation of the Platform for Action . 
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible and also to ensure that the documents related to the Year and the Decade , once adopted , are transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
To achieve that objective , financial , technical and material support must be extended to those developing countries which lacked resources , especially African countries like Kenya , as well as to those United Nations bodies which were directly concerned with human rights questions .  
RIESCO ( Director of Conference Services ) , reporting on the technical and financial implications of the proposal by the representative of the Netherlands that the Committee should rationalize its work by scheduling four two-hour meetings daily , beginning at 9 a.m . , 11 a.m . , 2 p.m . and 4 p.m . , said that , while the Secretariat would be ready to provide conference services to accommodate whatever schedule would be most productive for the Committee 's work , the proposal raised a number of issues relating to the efficient use of resources .  
Notes with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General on the problem of diplomatic indebtedness , [ 4 ] stresses that such indebtedness is a matter of significant concern to the United Nations and that non-payment of undisputed debts reflects badly on the entire diplomatic community and tarnishes the image of the Organization itself , reaffirms that non-compliance with contractual obligations can not be condoned or justified , and endorses the proposals and procedures on the issue of financial indebtedness set out in annex II to the current report of the Committee ;  
It was in the best interests of all States to support genuine efforts devoid of any hidden political interest and to that end , to enter into a frank dialogue and to emphasize crisis prevention rather than simply reacting to human rights violations which usually accompanied crises .  It was in that spirit that his delegation supported the appeal for new human and financial resources launched by the High Commissioner for Human Rights .  
Renews its appeal to all Governments , especially the Governments of developed countries and other Governments in a position to do so , as well as to international and regional financial institutions , to make substantial contributions to the voluntary fund established by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 180 for the purpose of financing preparatory activities for the Conference and supporting developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , in participating fully and effectively in the Conference and its preparatory process ;  
Stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Recognizing that the international community should continue to give strong support to the efforts of the developing countries to solve their grave economic and social problems as well as to promote a favourable climate for private financial flows through the creation of a favourable international economic environment ,  
Expressing concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
recognizes the need for a stronger and central role for the Fund in surveillance of all countries , in a symmetrical manner , in accordance with paragraph 4 of the communiqu of the Interim Committee of the Board of Governors of the Fund , dated 26 April 1995 , with regard to potential sources of destabilization of capital markets with a view to promoting transparency and stability in international financial markets and promoting economic growth , such surveillance including , among other elements , the regular and timely provision of economic and financial data ;  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;  
Further stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
The Conference will consider relevant national and international policies and strategies that are needed to enable developing countries to take full advantage of the opportunities for growth and development offered by the new global context while minimizing the risks of new imbalances and instabilities , including in international financial markets , and the potential marginalization of the least developed countries and other weaker economies .  
While some delegations believed that financial liberalization had led to an increase of speculative capital movements , others saw inadequate economic policies and poor fundamentals as the main culprit , in particular excessive creation of domestic credit , loose fiscal policies and insufficient domestic savings .  
The Conference will consider relevant national and international policies and strategies that are needed to enable developing countries to take full advantage of the opportunities for growth and development offered by the new global context while minimizing the risks of new imbalances and instabilities , including in international financial markets , and the potential marginalization of the least developed countries and other weaker economies . 
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Currently , the health of women in Rwanda was extremely vulnerable due to lack of medical infrastructure , supplies and personnel , limited financial resources , lack of access to health care , malnutrition , unsafe drinking-water , and the spread of HIV / AIDS . Women were more susceptible to diseases than men because they were overworked , had unplanned pregnancies , were malnourished during pregnancy and suffered complications from childbirth . 
My delegation believes the report provides us with important information regarding the political , military , humanitarian , financial , economic and social aspects of the situation in Angola , which , in our opinion , will prove invaluable to our discussion concerning the future of UNAVEM III .  
The Conference noted that the participation of scientists , researchers and educators from developing countries in international projects , as well as in international scientific information exchange , was extremely limited not only due to insufficient resources ( both financial and human ) , but also because of inadequate access to scientific and technical information .  
To enable timely procurement of essential goods and services required for new missions and the maintenance of ongoing missions , and in order for the Controller to exercise the authority granted under financial rule 110.6 ( Commitments against the appropriations of current and future financial periods ) , relevant criteria , restrictions and new procedures were introduced during January 1995 to facilitate requests for use of this authority in certain key areas of procurement for peace-keeping operations .  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Recognizing that the new forms of criminal activities of international drug trafficking organizations call for enhanced international cooperation , as well as a renewal of the international commitment to fight against these menaces , and require the formulation of new strategies , approaches and objectives which , respectful of the sovereignty of States , can deal more effectively with the international operations of those involved in the illegal traffic of drugs and arms , the diversion of precursors and essential chemicals , and money laundering through financial and non-financial operations ,  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Efficient and effective use of existing international technical and financial mechanisms , and their comparative advantages for different key issues and subsectors in forestry at the national level .  
AKL ( Lebanon ) said that he would welcome the establishment , by means of a multilateral treaty , of an international criminal court as a permanent and independent judicial organ which would have relations with the United Nations system that would guarantee its authority , universality , and administrative and financial viability .  
Emphasizing the importance of cooperation and international solidarity in supporting the efforts being made by the peoples and Governments of Central America for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace , and the need to strengthen the new programme of cooperation and economic , technical and financial assistance for Central America in the light of the new situation in the region ,  
Supports the treatment accorded to Nicaragua in the light of its continuing exceptional circumstances , so that the international community and financial institutions can incorporate that treatment into programmes to support the country 's economic recovery and social reconstruction ;  
Urgently appeals to all States , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue to provide , on a priority basis and as far as conditions on the ground permit , all possible financial , technical and material assistance for the restoration of the basic services and the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the voluntary , safe and secure return of refugees and internally displaced persons , and appeals to the international financial and development institutions to assist in the planning of the reconstruction of Afghanistan ;  
Governments should promote the establishment of self-sustaining financial mechanisms in support of , inter alia : ( i ) training of personnel ; ( ii ) navigational safety and antipollution measures in international straits ; ( iii ) waste reception facilities in ports ; and ( iv ) salvage and emergency response facilities and capacity-building in hydrographic surveying and nautical charting .  
Donor Governments should consider increasing their financial support to the initiatives undertaken by developing countries and countries with economies in transition , through bilateral and multilateral channels , for national , regional ( including support to regional organizations ) and global programmes .  
In these cities and towns , large sections of the world 's urban population live in inadequate conditions and are confronted with serious problems , including environmental problems , that are exacerbated by inadequate planning and managerial capacities , lack of investment and technology , and insufficient mobilization and inappropriate allocation of financial resources , as well as by a lack of social and economic opportunities .  
Although many countries , particularly developing countries , lack legal , institutional , financial , technological and human resources to respond adequately to rapid urbanization , many local authorities are taking on these challenges with open , accountable and effective leadership and are eager to bring people into the sustainable development process .  
Apply transparent , comprehensive , easily accessible and progressive taxation and incentive mechanisms to stimulate the efficient , environmentally sound and equitable use of land , and exploit the full potential of land-based and other forms of taxation in mobilizing financial resources for service provision by local authorities ;  
To provide opportunities for productive employment and private investment , Governments at the appropriate levels , including local authorities , in consultation with workers ' and employers ' organizations , chambers of commerce , industry , trade , consumer organizations , professional associations , and the financial sector , including the cooperative sector , and in the context of comprehensive urban planning , should :  
The tools for achieving a physically more balanced development include not only specific urban and regional policies and legal , economic , financial , cultural and other measures , but also innovative methods of urban planning and design and of urban development , renewal and management .  
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and the secretariats of the regional commissions , as well as the principal financial and technical institutions and all other partners at the regional and global levels , should consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination in the fields of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
We commit ourselves to strengthening existing financial mechanisms and , where appropriate , developing new mechanisms for financing the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , which will mobilize increased sources of finance - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - at the international , regional , national and local levels , and will promote the efficient , effective and accountable allocation and management of resources .  
Stimulating national and local economies , through enabling competitive and sustainable economic development that will attract public and international financial resources and private investments , generate employment and increase revenues , providing a stronger financial base to support shelter and human settlements development ;  
The international community , including multilateral financial institutions , has an important role to play in providing additional resources to reinforce national efforts to foster an enabling environment so as to achieve the objectives of adequate shelter for all and the sustainable development of human settlements .  
These approaches and frameworks should also include new and improved forms of cooperation and coordination between and among multilateral financial institutions , international organizations , and various organs and bodies of the United Nations system , including South-South , North-South and South-North exchanges of best practices , and the continuous development of tools and instruments for policy , planning and management such as the application of shelter and urban indicators , human resources development and institutional capacity-building . 145 bis .  
The coordination of macroeconomic policies at all levels so as to achieve an international financial system that is conducive to stable and sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Striving to enhance the effectiveness of existing official development assistance and other external financial flows through improving coordination between and among donors and the United Nations operational activities , and through better coherence between those flows and internal sustainable human settlements strategies ;  
Strengthening financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes , and strengthening cooperation among Governments at all levels , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises , and international institutions , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to low-income individuals , women , and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups for shelter and human settlements development ;  
Also invites all other relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions and the World Trade Organization , to contribute to the special session , and requests the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session ;  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
At its first session , the Panel re-emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms , as mutually agreed , and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
The Commission made substantial progress at its third session in identifying and analysing various mechanisms and instruments for the financing of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) , and it indicated that in its future work it would focus on improving the conditions for financing from external financial resources , facilitating access to traditional national financing mechanisms , and promoting innovative mechanisms for the financing of ESTs ( see E / CN . 17 / 1995 / 8 ) .  
Reaffirms that the effective implementation of the Programme of Action will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and , in this context , calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on population and development and to intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Programme of Action , in order to ensure that population and development objectives and goals are met ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand , where possible , fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the medium term in controlling malaria , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority ;  
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to continue its efforts to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
At the end of the 12-month period provided in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account until payment is effected ;  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the least developed countries and to enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
Requests improved annual reporting on financial flows including allocations / expenditures based on consistent criteria , relating to the costed elements of the Programme of Action , including a clear account of levels and trends of funding by source ( bilateral , multilateral ( both core and non-core ) , private , domestic allocations , etc . ) ;  
This effectiveness may be measured by a number of different factors , including the development of new instruments , mechanisms and standards so as to respond to need , as it arises ; the effective integration of environmental and developmental issues ; implementation , monitoring and compliance ; the participation of developing countries in negotiation , implementation , review and governance ; financial and technical assistance to developing countries ; dispute avoidance and settlement ; coordination and consistency among international legal instruments ; and the identification of new and emerging issues in the field of sustainable development .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and , in some cases , inadequate access to technologies , may all hinder implementation and compliance .  
Chapter 39 calls for the provision to developing countries of technical assistance for the purpose of enhancing their national legislative capabilities in the field of environmental law ; it also states ( para . that technical and financial support should include assistance in building up expertise in international law particularly in relation to sustainable development .  
Most burdensome , however , are those requirements for various environmental standards , procurement regulations and reports that must adhere to different guidelines or formats ; ( d ) national politics , commercial demands , varying programming and budget cycles and so forth of donor countries themselves impose constraints to donor coordination ; and ( e ) reductions in financial commitments and technical staff and trends towards decentralized decision-making all complicate coordination . 
Capacity-development , like sustainable development , encompasses a wide range of aspects , including the human , technological , organizational , financial , scientific , cultural and institutional .  
The shift in emphasis from planning to strategy implementation of sustainable development has led practitioners to confront familiar institutional constraints - highly compartmentalized organizations in the public sector , difficulties in promoting more decentralization , the continuation of sectoral thinking and acting , lack of sufficient accountability and responsiveness , a shortage of financial and skilled human resources , poor salary and working conditions , and a lack of a performance culture in many development organizations .  
Invites Member States and regional , international and non-governmental organizations to stand ready to provide assistance in support of progress achieved by the parties towards political dialogue , and to cooperate with the Government of Burundi in initiatives for comprehensive rehabilitation in Burundi , including in military and police reform , judicial assistance , development programmes and support at international financial institutions ;  
Invites Member States and regional , international and non-governmental organizations to stand ready to provide assistance in support of progress achieved by the parties towards political dialogue , and to cooperate with the Government of Burundi in initiatives for comprehensive rehabilitation in Burundi , including in military and police reform , judicial assistance , development programmes and support at international financial institutions ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
Bearing in mind the relevant resolutions on the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance during the transition period , a process of peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-building , in particular its resolutions 49 / 137 and 49 / 21 I of 19 and 20 December 1994 , respectively , which emphasize the compelling need to design a new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities established by the Governments of the region ,  
Emphasizes the importance of supporting and strengthening the new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities laid down in the Declaration of Commitments adopted by the Follow-up Committee of the International Conference on Central American Refugees and in the new subregional development strategy , the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America ;  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America ;  
Noting that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community to the implementation of the priority programmes in fulfilment of the Peace Agreement , including the strengthening of democratic institutions , the national reconstruction plan and the economic and social development plan , the implementation of certain programmes and projects basic to the process has continued to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability and the reduction of financial resources in support of the consolidation of peace ,  
Recognizing that El Salvador is at a complex stage in the process of consolidating peace , which calls not only for the implementation of the remaining commitments under the Peace Agreement but also for a new approach involving the implementation and consolidation of medium-term and long-term national development programmes and strategies aimed at resolving the structural problems that are the cause of tension and social instability , and emphasizing the importance and necessity of international technical and financial assistance , both bilateral and multilateral ,  
Renews its invitation to the international financial institutions , in particular the International Monetary Fund , the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , to continue to pay special attention to the economic problems of the affected States and their adverse social impact and to consider ways and means for mobilizing and providing resources on appropriate terms for mitigating the continuing negative impact of the sanctions on the efforts of the affected States for financial stabilization as well as for development of regional transport and communications infrastructure ;  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
Requests the Government of Burundi to continue its efforts geared towards the achievement of national reconciliation and the maintenance of lasting peace , inter alia , through adherence to the principles of the Convention on Governance , provisions that are essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of humanitarian aid and economic , financial , material and technical assistance to the people of Burundi ;  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
The Registry , as the administrative organ , is required to : ( a ) provide legal , procedural , administrative , linguistic and any technical support ; ( b ) be responsible for the financial and accounting administration ; ( c ) also be responsible for documentation , archiving and library services ; ( d ) carry out personnel management and administration ; and ( e ) provide for all purchasing , storage and other general services .  
Experience gained in those missions indicates that , given the complexity of the logistical , contractual and financial issues involved , sufficient time and staff resources should be provided for the in situ completion of all such administrative liquidation tasks , as this reduces the number of unresolved residual matters that have to be dealt with at Headquarters after the liquidation team has been disbanded .  
At the end of the 12-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account until payment is effected ;  
Acting on the recommendation of the Tangier Declaration , the General Assembly adopted resolution 49 / 136 on public administration and development , in which it recognized the important role that Governments and public administrations can play in addressing new responsibilities arising from the pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , and also recognized the need for strengthened public administrative and financial management capacities in order to ensure a civil service that is responsive to the needs of the people .  
The specific topics under the theme " Capacity-building in public administration " were the enhancement of policy development capacity , organizational strengthening , improved civil service systems , the strengthening of financial management for development , human resource development for the public sector , and the development of administrative capacities for post-conflict and crisis conditions .  
For nearly 50 years , the United Nations programme in public administration and finance has actively supported technical cooperation areas of administrative restructuring and reform , human resource development , institutional building in training areas , resource mobilization , financial management and the improved performance of public enterprises .  
By responding to the changing needs of developing countries in strengthening their administrative , financial and information systems for better development management , it is anticipated that better working relationships can be created at the country level between the public and private sector .  
For the past 45 years , pursuant to its various legislative mandates , the United Nations programme in public administration and finance has sought to meet the expressed needs of developing countries in improving their administrative and financial management systems for development .  
While the largest proportion of activities fall into the traditional areas of administrative reform , training and financial systems improvement , it is increasingly common to receive requests from the field in emerging areas such as transparency , accountability , judicial and legislative administration , disaster management , electoral administration and result-oriented management based on productivity improvement .  
Some of these specific issues being addressed include organizational structures ; systems and processes of government for decision-making , budgeting and financial management , personnel management and appropriate incentive systems ; adequate legal and regulatory frameworks ; managerial and technical skills ; and organizational capacity to learn from and adapt to the changing environment . 
At its twelfth meeting , the Group of Experts identified several high-priority areas , such as advice in policy formulation and implementation strategies , administrative restructuring for economic reform , people-oriented development , strategic fiscal and financial management , and strengthening of training in , for example , evaluation and management of change , in which Member States may seek technical help from United Nations agencies . 
The Committee heard an oral representation by the representative of Kyrgyzstan , in which reference was made to the serious financial difficulties of Kyrgyzstan , its over-assessment under the current scale of assessment and the necessity to sustain at least a minimum level of social provision .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Invites Member States , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue and intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda , particularly in the areas of the administration of justice , and welcomes the contributions made , including those at the Round Table Conference at Geneva and its mid-term review , and urges States and donor agencies to fulfil their earlier commitments ;  
While it was clearly stated in the draft resolution as presented that the request for additional meeting time for the Committee should be considered by the General Assembly within the overall existing budget framework , the Secretariat was obliged to make a statement on financial implications in view of the current financial situation faced by the Organization , namely , that : " In adopting the programme budget for 1996-1997 , the General Assembly decided that savings of $ 103.9-million were to be achieved in the programme budget during the biennium .  
13 Insufficient human and financial resources and limited administrative capacities and logistical infrastructure contributed to the low absorptive capacity characteristic of several States of the region , and to a level of activities lower than that envisaged by UNDCP .  
UNDCP will seek to be more closely engaged in securing the involvement and active commitment of potential bilateral donors , international financial institutions , agencies and programmes within the United Nations system and regional organizations involved in development work .  
I believe that it would be a grievous setback for the Organization if , because of the current financial debate , it became impossible to retain MICIVIH , whose presence is essential to consolidate the Organization 's and Members States ' remarkable achievements in Haiti , and MINUGUA , whose presence is fundamental to realization of the best prospects that have ever existed to bring to an end the armed confrontation which has afflicted the people of Guatemala for 35 years .  
At the end of the 12-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the special account until payment is effected ;  
Assistant Budget Officer ( P-2 ) .  Reporting to the Budget Officer , the incumbent would be responsible for ( a ) coordinating , collecting and organizing proposed budgets of substantive offices ; ( b ) assisting in the preparation of budgets and performance reports of UNAVEM and the monitoring of allotments ; and ( c ) preparing standard and special financial budgetary reports and related correspondence , as required , for the Chief Administrative Officer .  
Stressing the necessity of promoting and implementing policies to create a supportive international economic environment , through , inter alia , alleviation of the external debt burden and the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , through mobilization and / or the provision of new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , and by ensuring equitable terms of trade and increased access of women in developing countries to markets , productive investments and technologies ,  
Endorses the conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory Committee as contained in its report ; 3 .  Reiterates its requests to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and to report on the action that he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
KOVACS ( International Telecommunication Union ) introducing the thirty-fifth report of the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) on telecommunication and the peaceful uses of outer space ( A / AC . 105 / 634 ) , said that the past year had been extremely challenging , with an upsurge in interest in space-related communications , continuing technological developments , a changing administrative and financial environment and a growing demand for spectrum and orbit utilization .  
Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and requests him to report on the action he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
While the United Nations system continues to provide technical cooperation assistance and advisory services of a neutral and non-commercial nature in the field of mineral resources at the request of Member States , its ability to do so has been severely diminished owing to evolutions in the funding of technical cooperation activities , and current budgetary reductions and the financial situation in the United Nations Secretariat .  
Directly tied into this process has been the continued dissemination of individual country information through the very successful investment seminars and round-table discussions which have enabled private companies , financial institutions and technical advisers to gain a better understanding of various countries and their risk factors , and to develop good working relationships with private and government officials and the multilateral and bilateral aid institutions , all with a view towards creating a sustainable economic and environmentally sound base of operations on which to build within the various countries .  
Moreover , they were faced with severe financial constraints ( inadequate local funds , difficulties in raising loans from international markets and severe debt burdens due to restrictions on commercial bank lending ) .  
The private sector is slowly responding through increased financial investment , the development of primary and ancillary industries and businesses around mining , the implementation of education and training programmes for local workforces , the transfer of technology and the deepening of institutions required to sustain growth .  
Continue to support the role of multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies in the provision of structured finance including loans and equity ; senior lender guarantees ; political risk insurance and re-insurance ; in the development of small supporting businesses , through soft loans ; and in the development of internal financial institutions through loans and guarantees and the introduction of stock exchanges etc .  
Government and local business representatives should be encouraged to participate in national and international industry and technical groups as a means of facilitating technology transfer , gaining market intelligence , raising and keeping apprised of industry-wide issues and concerns and as a means of formulating long-term relationships with other industrial , government and financial leaders .  Local and national Chambers of Mines should be fully activated and supported in order to act as an effective vehicle for handling industry-wide concerns and effectively working with the appropriate governmental bodies .  
An action programme can then be prepared , based on the survey results , with a view to : ( a ) establishing enabling conditions for artisanal mining , ( b ) alleviating technical and financial constraints , and ( c ) improving the environmental , living and working conditions of miners .  
Confronting mining issues , such as the technical , legal and financial constraints faced , as well as environmental pollution and degradation , is necessary but not sufficient for solving the problems inherent in artisanal mining , since one of the problems associated with this type of mining is that it may create immediate income but often does not create improved living conditions or social development for the regions in which it occurs .  
One successor State reported that it adhered to all international treaties , and made proposals to the police of other countries to sign new bilateral agreements , particularly on cooperation in combating all types of transnational crime , such as organized crime , drug trafficking and economic and financial crime .  
It will require considerable technical expertise ( chemical , forensic , pharmacological and legal ) , as well as financial resources , at the country level .  
The new criminal provisions against money-laundering were based on the assumption that money-laundering could be defined as the systematic disguising of illegal assets , using the scope offered by the legal financial market , with a view to shielding them from seizure by the criminal prosecution authorities and preserving their economic value .  
The legislation regulating the use of cash exceeding 20-million liras ensured the identification of bank and financial brokers , and imposed upon them the obligation to inform the Questore of all suspicious transactions , without incurring penal and administrative sanctions because their collaboration exonerated them from criminal liability .  
Mexico had taken various measures and implemented a number of actions to prevent , detect and combat money-laundering , taking into account that one of its main origins was drug trafficking , the vast proceeds of which were being channelled into national financial and commercial systems , a process that was being fostered by the increasing technological sophistication of the international finance system .  
Those amendments also introduced a requirement for banks and special financial institutions to report to the competent authorities all transfers abroad of Turkish lira and foreign currency exceeding US $ 50,000 or its equivalent , except in the case of exports , imports and invisible transactions .  
The United States strongly supported the efforts of the United Nations and other global and regional initiatives designed to promote the harmonization of the world 's financial , regulatory and legal regimes , thereby achieving more effective control of the laundering of the proceeds of serious crime .  
Besides encouraging States to become parties to the 1988 Convention , to enact financial legislation that did not run counter to the guidelines of FATF , and to increase multilateral cooperation in investigations and prosecutions , the recommendations focused on the improvement of national legal systems to combat money-laundering , the enhancement of the role of the financial system , understood in its broadest sense , and the strengthening of international cooperation .  
Non-bank financial institutions include a wide variety of exchange houses , cheque-cashing services , insurers , mortgagers , brokers , importers , exporters , trading companies , gold and precious metal dealers , casinos , express delivery services and other money movers of varying degrees of sophistication and capability , and other underground banking systems .  
Stress the need to develop a greater range of more attractive positive measures , such as effective instruments to facilitate financial and technology transfers to developing countries in order to assist them to meet multilaterally agreed targets , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility ; and recommend that positive measures are preferable to the threat of the use of trade restrictions to secure compliance with the objectives of the MEA .  
In addition , its stable currency and Government , advanced financial system , free movement of funds and democratic safeguards against police powers together make Canada inviting to persons engaging in international money-laundering .  
18 If transnational criminal organizations reap considerable benefits from their links with the licit business and financial sectors , they also find it both necessary and advantageous to co-opt public officials , whether to obtain official documents or export licences , to help launder the proceeds of criminal activity or to provide intelligence .  
Such a method of operation may be characterized by widespread use of bribery and favours to ensure the malleability of key positions and agencies ; political funding to ensure that politicians elected to office will be indebted to the criminal organizations ; carefully targeted " payoffs " to law enforcement personnel to provide intelligence ; and the provision of financial incentives to members of the judiciary to ensure that the penalties for criminal activities are either not imposed or are modest .  
Italy has expressed its conviction that , in the face of expanding organized transnational crime and the effects of such expansion on global financial systems , the international community should develop an organized and systematized global response .  The innovative aspect of the World Ministerial Conference held at Naples was its emphasis on a global approach to organized transnational crime regardless of its manifestations .  
On the contrary , this threat is an inevitable consequence of the activities of organizations that deny the State its legitimate monopoly of violence , corrupt State institutions , undermine the rule of law , threaten the integrity of financial and commercial sectors of society , contravene legal and social norms and conventions , transgress national sovereignty and violate national borders . 
The loss of political momentum is a consequence of a short attention span , combat fatigue and a deep fiscal crisis of the public sector in practically all OECD countries , a crisis that is epitomized by the current situation of the United Nations , which is plagued by financial collapse , a distorted image and low morale . 
The requested oral report on the status of an interregional workshop to formulate a pilot project ( for an appropriate region ) which should develop standard approaches to the identification and qualitative assessment of permissive tracts and be based on geographical information system technology , that would allow integration with other land management information will not be presented due to the current financial situation of the United Nations , which has prevented the workshop from being financed and prepared . 
38 The Holy See suggested that the Congress should focus on the development of new international legal instruments and forms of international jurisdiction to combat transnational crime linked to : speculative financial transactions severely harming the economy of one or more States ; activities , also undertaken by private persons , provoking very severe harm to the environment of other States ; extensive terrorism resulting from organized transnational crime ; and the role of education in combating violence and organized criminality .  
The Registry , as the administrative organ , is required to : ( a ) provide legal , procedural , administrative , linguistic and any technical support ; ( b ) be responsible for the financial and accounting administration ; ( c ) also be responsible for documentation , archiving and library services ; ( d ) carry out personnel management and administration ; and ( e ) provide for all purchasing , storage and other general services .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace of global economic developments and their implications for all countries , particularly developing countries , and the critical importance of efficient and effective government institutions , administrative systems and procedures , and sound financial management to harness these changes in support of economic and social progress and sustainable development ,  
Noting that improved efficiency in government requires strengthened and efficient public administrative and financial management capacities in order to ensure a civil service that is responsive to the needs of the economy and the civil society and the provision of quality services ,  
Undertaking research on effective systems and procedures in public administration , with particular attention devoted to the civil service systems , administrative structures and administrative reorganization , decentralization , aid management , accountability , financial management , metropolitan and local governance , approaches to rehabilitation and reconstruction of government and administrative services in post-conflict situations , and to ensure the timely distribution of these research results to Member States ;  
Within [ a ] [ the ] stated period [ of one / two years ] after separation from public service , public officials holding managerial positions shall , within the framework of national law , obtain governmental permission prior to accepting employment or consultancy assignments from business or private concerns that are in [ direct ] financial relationship with the governmental department or agency in which such officials were employed .  
Behind the trafficking in children were situations involving poverty and abandonment , which often stemmed from social and economic problems of families , such as widespread unemployment ; little State support for large families or for families with little income ; young persons quitting school because of financial problems of their families ; debts of families contracted with usurers or with criminal organizations repaid by illicit work or illicit activities involving minors ; and moral or social degeneration in suburbs .  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and requests him to report on the action he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace and interdependence of global , political , social and economic developments , and their implications for all countries , particularly the developing countries , and that there is a critical need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management to harness these challenges in support of sustainable development in all countries ,  
In particular , the net inflow of external financial resources and the greater or lesser uncertainty prevailing in domestic markets as a result of foreign or domestic events were decisive factors in the policies applied in response to the crisis .  
Most ESCWA member countries have developed , or are developing , strategies or plans to combat environmental degradation and achieve sustainable development .  However , financial constraints and reduced public expenditure are apparently hindering the implementation of such strategies and plans .  
In addition , the costs of building additional storage facilities and conveyance systems are soaring , and attempts to recover costs have so far met with little progress ; financial constraints are contributing to a revision of previous policies ; and many contemporary projects are being questioned by vocal environmental movements .  
Thus , while the Advisory Panel has traditionally met once a month , it recently agreed to meet twice monthly , one meeting to address immediate and ongoing management and financial issues , and the other meeting to be devoted to discussions of major policy issues and the development of strategic directives .  
Special attention was given to the building and effective utilization of critical human , institutional and infrastructural capacities , particularly in the production , trade , monetary and financial , and physical infrastructure fields , as well as for the enhancement of public and private sector development and management .  
A second objective will be to increase awareness of the changing nature , volume and direction of international financial flows , propose ways and means to enhance and stabilize both official and private finance , monitor changes in the external debt situation and identify innovative approaches and strategies to resolve the difficulties of countries with debt-servicing problems ;  
While the reduction of posts was a factor in determining final output , the main consideration of the comprehensive review was to find a sustainable level of resources , taking into account the workload analysis for the period under review and bearing in mind the financial constraints faced by the Organization .  
Since private capital flows are becoming a major source of financing for developing countries , African countries that seem to be involved in a process of adjusting their financial structures and liberalizing their economies are likely to attract foreign resources , both for portfolio , and more particularly , direct investment .  Creation of domestic capital markets , as complementary measures to the process of economic liberalization and privatization , is essential if the countries need to broaden and improve the savings / investment process .  
But the most important prerequisites for the successful mobilization of foreign and domestic resources are confidence in the financial system and appropriate macroeconomic policies , a well-established and clear legal and regulatory framework , a transparent and non-distortionary taxation system , a stable domestic financial system , and adequate infrastructure .  
Stabilization of prices and exchange rates would ensure positive rates of return on domestic assets , while a more aggressive drive by the formal financial institutions through intensive branch expansion , the broadening of the menu of saving instruments and the forging of strong linkages with the informal financial institutions , would have a positive impact on the volume of resources mobilized .  
Strengthening and improving financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes and strengthening cooperation among Governments , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises and international agencies , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to small entrepreneurs , small farmers and other low-income self-employed workers , with particular efforts to ensure the availability of such services to women .  
In addition , their capacity to take advantage of the expansionary cycles of international and regional trade and to withstand adverse conditions and financial instability must be increased through the diversification of products and markets , the search for foreign investment and partnerships , the use of domestic stabilization mechanisms and better linkages between exports and other productive activities .  
Special attention will be paid to two issues : the compatibility between economic policy ( fiscal , monetary and exchange rate policies ) and the structural reforms that are being implemented in the region ; and the new types of external constraints that could result from financial globalization and the development of new debt instruments and facilities ;  
The tasks identified by the Secretary-General included availability and management of water , sustainable food security , capacity - building for governance , social and human development and mobilization of external and internal financial resources for African development .  
The volume and quality of the work the Institute has been able to perform is noteworthy , taking into consideration the reduced number of professional staff available , the numerous vacancies at the management level , and the limited financial resources at its disposal .  
If there exists substantiated evidence of overt and covert governmental financial influence or otherwise to induce an organization to undertake acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , or substantiated evidence of influence from proceeds resulting from criminal activities , such as the illicit drugs trade , money laundering or the illegal arms trade ; EU proposes :  
Also calls upon the international community to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including ( , as mutually agreed , ) on concessional and grant terms ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus until payment is effected .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Mission in Haiti until payment is effected ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda until payment is effected ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Mission in Haiti until payment is effected .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus until payment is effected .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda until payment is effected ;  
The Executive Board also decided that the allocation of resources should be based on a comprehensive assessment of the actual needs and requirements of countries , and should take fully into consideration coherent national programmes , plans and strategies on population and development and the need for external resources to complement national financial efforts in the area of population and development ; and endorsed the procedure for categorization of countries into three groups as outlined in the report and approved the relative shares of resources among them .  
At the same time , the financial benefits of common premises are not evident in all cases , particularly if a move into joint premises can not fully accommodate all operational requirements , or if various current premises are provided by the Government free of charge as part of its in-kind contribution to the organizations , or if opportunities for appropriate premises are scarce and initial costs of moving are significant .  
As the implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require adequate funding , we must mobilize financial resources at the national and international levels , including new and additional resources from all sources - multilateral and bilateral , public and private .  In this connection , we must facilitate capacity-building and promote the transfer of appropriate technology and know-how .  
Performance generally reflected strong growth in tourism and in offshore financial services , as well as increased domestic investment , with the gross domestic product recorded at US $ 90.2-million .  
The unsatisfactory housing situation was attributed to a number of constraints , including the lack of a national housing policy and implementation strategy reflecting current and prospective economic realities , inadequate delivery of land for housing , the lack of financial mechanisms that cater to the needs of the low - and middle-income groups , and high construction costs in relation to incomes .  
Throughout the year , the ESCAP Pacific Operations Centre offered advisory and technical assistance to Pacific island countries in development programming , central banking , macroeconomic policy formulation , financial systems , trade promotion , development of port infrastructure and macroeconomic management , and provided short consultancies upon specific requests .  
Economic development and cooperation , documents were issued on the annual survey of economic and social developments in the ESCWA region , 1994 ; stock markets in the ESCWA region ; developments and issues in the external trade and payments situation of countries of Western Asia ; developments and trends in the monetary and financial sectors ; revitalization of research and development activities in selected countries of the ESCWA region ; and techno-economic aspects of the application of new materials in the ESCWA region .  
In paragraph 2 ( b ) of its resolution 1995 / 56 , the Economic and Social Council urged the governing bodies of relevant organizations of the United Nations system to review , during the period from 1995 to 1997 , issues concerning the role and operational responsibilities , as well as the operative and financial capacities , of their respective organizations to respond , within their mandates , in the context of broad and comprehensive humanitarian programmes .  
Providing the programme planning , financial , personnel , legal , management , administrative and general services that are essential for the rational selection of work items and allocating resources among them and for the effective , economic and efficient performance of the services and functions of the Secretariat , within the legal framework of regulations , rules and policies adopted by the Assembly .  
The European Union is of the view that these objectives are attainable through a strengthened political dialogue to be held on a regular basis , through the development of financial and economic cooperation and by granting a more important role to the social , human and cultural dimensions of this dialogue .  
Ukraine is prepared to cooperate in the effort to combat terrorism , international organized crime , illegal trafficking in narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances , explosives , poisonous substances and radioactive materials , and illegal transborder movements of persons , cargoes , goods and valuables ; in the effort to suppress crimes against persons and government property , and criminal offences in the economic , financial and banking spheres ; and in exchanges of convicted persons .  
Arranging for dissemination to the public of information on the Authority 's activities and decisions ; ( i ) Providing the programme planning , financial , personnel , legal , management and general services that are essential for the rational selection of work items and allocating resources among them and for the effective , economical and efficient performance of the services and functions of the Secretariat , within the legal framework of regulations , rules and policies adopted by the Assembly .  
While it is the primary responsibility of African States to bear the bulk of their development burden by tapping as a matter of priority their own financial resources , the rigid international economic environment , the domestic economic hardship and the lukewarm disposition of some creditors to adopt radical measures have constituted obstacles to the mobilization of financial resources and to the development of Africa .  
ESCAP / POC currently has an advisory strength of nine advisers covering such diverse areas as economic and financial management , development and strategic planning , physical planning , sustainable development , social development , women in development , trade and investment , and ports and harbours development .  
Considerable international technical and financial assistance is provided by the housing cooperative movement in developed countries ; for example , for 44 years , the United States Cooperative Housing Foundation has supported projects in 90 countries , and is currently active in 30 , including major projects in South Africa and Poland . CECODHAS and ICA Housing work energetically in support of housing cooperatives in the transitional economies . 
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus until payment is effected .  
Considering the current economic and financial situation worldwide , the decreasing levels of official development assistance and the concentration of private investment in countries with abundant forest resources , special attention will have to be given to the needs of the least developed countries with low forest cover .  NULLIn addressing the needs and requirements of countries with areas of low forest cover or with low forest cover overall , particularly developing countries , the Panel may wish to consider the proposals outlined below .  
In respect of such currencies , the financial statements , prepared at such intervals as may be prescribed by the Controller under delegation of authority from the Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management , shall reflect the cash , investments , unpaid pledges and current accounts receivable and payable in currencies other than United States dollars , translated at the applicable United Nations rates of exchange in effect as at the date of the statements .  
Other indicators of the deepening integration of countries in transition with international capital markets are the rise in borrowing by private and partially privatized corporations and municipalities ( departing from the past practice of uniquely sovereign borrowing ) , the use of a broader range of instruments ( for example , increasing use of syndicated loans in addition to bonds ) , and further geographical and currency diversification of financial sources .  
With regard to technical assistance , ESCAP has focused on strengthening national management capacities in developing the financial , industrial , infrastructural , trading and other institutional framework required in managing transition to a market economy .  
Efforts in management development , civil service reform and decentralization include support to national and local government administrations , improvement of financial auditing and control at all levels , capacity-building in the areas of foreign investment promotion and negotiation , support for the development of participatory approaches to environmental management and technical assistance to develop Governments ' capacities in the area of informatics .  
Many serious technical problems have been noted in the use of physical infrastructure , such as outdated vehicles and rolling stock , lack of repair facilities , lack of financial means to buy new vehicles , problems of break gauge , bogie change and axle load on railroads , and problems of CIS brake systems and automatic coupling ( SA-3 ) , which are not compatible with the wagons and trains of non-CIS countries .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
The third session of the Commission and the first session of the Panel emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms as mutually agreed and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account the ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
The principal implications of this approach for donors and financing agencies would entail ( a ) using local administrative units as a basis for designing donors supported programmes , ( b ) increasing reliance on local resources in implementation , both human and material and ( c ) using participatory structures for programme management , supported by transparent mechanisms for financial control at the local level .  
It is desirable for the information systems to be Internet-based for this would allow easy access and information-sharing among multilateral agencies , countries ' institutions , non-governmental organizations and other interested parties .  The Panel may wish to invite relevant multilateral forest agencies and international organizations to review and initiate the development of improved information systems that support activities for sustainable forest management , particularly so as to facilitate private sector investment , speed up technology transfer to developing countries and improve coordination in financial assistance .  
None of the existing international legal instruments , as they currently stand , may have the potential to fully ensure a coordinated approach in international policy , financial issues and integration at the institutional level regarding forests and forest-related activities .  
Indigenous people should have access to adequate financial and technical assistance , from States and through international cooperation , to pursue freely their cultural , economic , social and spiritual development and for the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognized in the present Declaration .  
Taking into account the understanding that emerged from discussions held on issues relating to programme element I . 1 during the second session of the Panel and at national , regional and international meetings after the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , including the expert meetings on financial mechanisms and on the Implementation of the Forest Principles ( see para . 5 ) , the Panel may wish to consider endorsing the elements of national forest programmes discussed below as applicable to all types of forests .  
The objectives of the review were to determine whether the management structure of the civilian component was appropriate in providing the necessary support service to UNPF , to assess the adequacy of management systems and internal controls and to ascertain whether the use of United Nations resources ( human , physical and financial ) was adequately planned , organized , directed and monitored , and whether value for money was achieved .  
Finally , as will be discussed below , improved information on markets and revenues is required in order to assess the additional financial assistance that may be needed by low-income producer countries if they are to adopt sustainable forest management and the most efficient and equitable international mechanism for providing that assistance .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Delayed publication of semi-annual financial statements ; elimination of miscellaneous supplemental schedules to the main financial statement ; elimination of preliminary unaudited financial statements for regular budget and peace-keeping budgets at the end of the biennium ; elimination of supplementary annex to technical cooperation report . ( b ) Payments and disbursements .  
To take measures to promote the awareness of all parties concerned ( be they developing countries , non-governmental organizations or other public or private bodies active in this field ) , of the important role that communication plays in the development process , thus contributing to mobilizing the technical and financial resources needed for pursuing the goals and objectives of the Programme .  
The sanctions secretariat has established working contacts and elaborated practical modalities for cooperation with other parts of the Secretariat , relevant programmes and agencies of the United Nations system and international financial institutions in order to provide better information and early assessments about the actual or potential effects of sanctions on third States .  
The objective should be , therefore , to develop a common methodology that could be used by the affected States in preparing the explanatory material for their requests for assistance , as well as by the United Nations system , the international financial institutions and the donor community in considering how their assistance activities may be helpful to mitigate the special economic problems of those States .  
On the other hand , indirect effects , which are , largely , the induced effects of the former , represent mainly the negative impact on domestic variables and may include disrupted production owing to the absence or higher cost of sanctioned supplies , suspended financial inputs and services , foregone profit tax or tariff revenues , lost jobs and the need to increase social benefits .  
In principle , estimates should cover both the direct , first round impact of sanctions ( which is evaluated as the income forgone and additional costs incurred , resulting from terminated trade in goods and services and suspended financial transfers ) and the indirect , second round effects such as the reduction of imported inputs following the decline of exports or output .  
Accordingly , the Secretary-General addressed letters , in July and September of 1993 and January of 1994 , to the executive heads of the competent organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations system , including the international financial organizations ( the World Bank and IMF ) and the regional development banks , requesting them to provide him with updated information on activities undertaken by them to alleviate the special economic problems of the affected States .  
As reported in the annual overview report for 1993 , the information received regarding additional measures or special assistance in response to the immediate hardships encountered and urgent needs faced by the affected countries was largely of a preliminary nature , which reflected the need to assess the extent of the impact of sanctions on the economies of the affected countries in order to assist them in developing appropriate policy responses and in preparing financial requirements for remedial measures . 
There have been financial losses of some $ 890-million owing to the non-implementation of letters of credit in , for example , the importation of ready-made clothing and shoes , milk and other baby food , electric and other domestic appliances , spare parts , home and office furniture , and other essential goods imported from abroad to meet the consumption needs of the local market ;  
New ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development , including poverty eradication , should be explored .  
Invites the financial and trade institutions participating in the high-level segment of the Council in 1997 to furnish relevant special reports and studies on the selected theme , within their respective mandates and areas of expertise , and on important developments in the world economy and in international economic cooperation ;  
In Costa Rica , it has assisted in the promotion of a national policy for the training of local administrators , specifically in financial management , as well as facilitating the creation of a Metropolitan Council for the City of San Jos ; and has supported the " State of the Nation " initiative , consisting of a participatory scheme to produce an annual report of the country 's sustainable human development performance and its most significant challenges . 
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
In view of the politico-economic environment in which well over half the 1995 expenditure was incurred , it is still considered that the additional resources , both human and financial , which would be required to analyse and forecast the inflation and exchange rate variation factors with any degree of reliability would be costly to UNHCR , the degree of reliability would most probably not be reached , and the added value to UNHCR would most probably be minimal .  
It will also draw up specific programmes as follow-up to the decisions taken in Agenda 21 and the Commission on Sustainable Development regarding the provision of adequate and predictable new and additional financial resources to developing countries , and mechanisms for the transfer of technology to those countries , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed in paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 " .  
Furthermore , the provisions of the resolution should be taken fully into account and implemented in a comprehensive and integrated manner , comprising all the necessary elements at the national and international levels , particularly those related to technology transfer , financial resources and enabling international economic environment through new initiatives for strengthening institutional capacity for enhancing international development cooperation .  
Thus , it should improve and support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development , concentrating on the needs of the population and the eradication of poverty .  
On 2 November 1995 , the General Assembly adopted resolution 50 / 10 , entitled " Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba " , in which it requested the Secretary-General , in consultation with the appropriate organs and agencies of the United Nations system , to prepare a report on the implementation of the resolution in the light of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and to submit it to the Assembly at its fifty-first session .  
At the eleventh summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , the heads of State or Government " called upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial measures and actions against Cuba which , in addition to being unilateral and contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and to the principle of neighbourliness , cause huge material losses and economic damage " .  
As has been shown , the Helms-Burton Act reinforces the United States Government 's traditional policy of imposing an economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba in order to strangle the country economically and force changes on the country 's political , social and institutional order .  
Also in that resolution , the General Assembly renewed its invitation to the international financial institutions to continue to pay special attention to the economic problems of the affected States and their adverse social impact and to consider ways and means for mobilizing and providing resources on appropriate terms for mitigating the continuing negative impact of the sanctions on those States .  
The Assembly renewed its request to the competent organs , programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations system to take into consideration , in programming their development activities , the special needs of the affected States and to consider providing assistance to them from their special programme resources , and renewed its appeal to all States , on an urgent basis , to provide technical , financial and material assistance to the affected States to mitigate the adverse impact of the sanctions on their economies .  
In addition , by a series of letters dated 16 April 1996 , the Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis , on behalf of the Secretary-General , requested the competent organs , programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations system , including the international financial institutions , as well as the regional organizations concerned , to provide him with updated information on the activities undertaken by them in response to the relevant provisions of the resolution .  
Decides further that any exceptions to this rule may be made by the body concerned only if the statements are to serve as bases for discussion and if , after hearing a statement of the relevant financial implications , the body decides that one or more statements in extenso may be included in the summary record , or reproduced as separate documents or as annexes to authorized documents . "  
At the Social Summit , Heads of State or Government acknowledged that the primary responsibility to attain the goals set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action rested with national Governments , with the support and contributions of the international community , the United Nations , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society , including private citizens .  
It stressed the need to implement sound and stable macroeconomic , microeconomic and sectoral policies that encouraged broad-based , sustained economic growth and development , and called upon the international community to seek to mobilize additional financial resources that were both adequate and predictable to contribute to poverty eradication .  
The Ministers noted the enormous cost and rapid changes in information and communication technology , which presently outpace the rate of acquisition and utilization of such communication equipment by developing countries , thus posing immense financial and technical difficulties and increasing the information and communication gap between developed and developing countries and their dependence on external broadcast and information .  
With financial support from Germany , preparatory work is already under way on a high-impact programme for entrepreneurship development among women , under which 10 national programmes will be elaborated , each aimed at releasing the principal technical , managerial , financial , institutional and policy constraints affecting the development of women 's entrepreneurship .  
It called upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand , where possible , fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the medium term in controlling malaria , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly encouraged the Director-General of WHO , through the WHO Division of Control of Tropical Diseases , to continue his efforts to mobilize international organizations , multilateral financial institutions , the specialized agencies , organs and programmes of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations as well as other groups to provide the affected developing countries , in particular African countries , with technical , medical and financial resources and assistance commensurate with the needs set forth in those countries ' national plans to control malaria .  
At the same time , the possibilities of financial support from non-traditional sources of funding , which have been opened up by the new partnerships established by the Habitat secretariat with , among others , the organized private sector , private foundations and municipal and local authorities , will be actively pursued by the Centre . D . Involvement of local authorities and civil society ,  
They include financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal liability of the member of the force . 
Changes and modifications proposed in the existing mechanism , such as , creating multiple claims review boards , increasing their financial authority and provision of additional experienced staff at the field and Headquarters levels , are designed to address the practical difficulties encountered .  
They include : financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from States contributing contingents for damage caused by gross negligence , wilful misconduct , or which entails the international criminal responsibility of the individual member of the Force .  
Other key events that created volatility in the currency and financial markets included the derivative losses incurred by established institutions and corporations , the Mexican financial crisis , which affected emerging markets in general , the strength of the yen against the dollar , and the continued struggle by the European Union to meet the convergence criteria for economic and monetary union .  
The following thematic areas were considered at the meeting : ( a ) policy development capacity and administrative restructuring , civil service reform and management training ; ( b ) financial management ; ( c ) human resources development ; ( d ) public-private interaction ; ( e ) public sector efficiency ; ( f ) social development ; ( g ) infrastructure and the environment ; ( h ) legal and regulatory framework ; ( i ) post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction of government machinery ; and ( j ) management of development programmes .  
The above savings were realized mainly as a result of more favourable rates for the hire of aircraft used for rotation of military personnel ; receipt of additional vehicles , equipment and supplies from other missions ; cancellation and deferment of maintenance projects as part of the special measures taken in relation to the bad financial situation in the United Nations ; and the reduced prices offered by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for petrol , oil and other lubricants .  
Urges Member States carefully to consider the problems posed by the international aspects of corrupt practices , especially as regards international economic activities carried out by corporate entities , and to study appropriate legislative and regulatory measures to ensure the transparency and integrity of financial systems and transactions carried out by such corporate entities ;  
Mobilizing adequate , timely and predictable financial resources , including new and additional funding from the Global Environment Facility of the agreed incremental costs of those activities concerning desertification that relate to its four focal areas , in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Instrument establishing the Global Environment Facility ;  
The Assembly requested relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and the multilateral financial institutions to strengthen their efforts to assist interested developing countries in the formulation and implementation of national water policies and strategies , and called upon the international community to give special attention to the revitalization of economic growth and sustainable development in developing countries , through , inter alia , a more diversified food and agriculture sector .  
The promise is that if food import prices rise because of the Uruguay Round , net food-importing developing countries and the least developed countries could be eligible for increased food aid , financial support to maintain normal food imports , technical support to raise agricultural productivity , and eventually favourable treatment on agricultural export credits .  
Especially fruitful cooperation was established with the Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation , which funded and organized the printing and dissemination of additional copies of the Compendium of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice in French , as well as the translation into French of the Basic Training Manual for Correctional Workers , and provided financial support also for the implementation of a comprehensive project in assistance to the criminal justice system for Burkina Faso , which was undertaken in March 1996 .  
The General Assembly in its resolution 50 / 113 invited all relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including multilateral financial institutions and WTO , to contribute to the special session , and requested the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session .  
Such measures should help the least developed countries to meet their obligations under the said agreements ; to secure financial , technical and technological support , as agreed in the relevant agreements ; and to secure compensation for losses they have suffered during implementation of the said agreements .  
This situation is particularly lamentable in the light of the fact that several States parties to the Convention are in possession of the financial and technical means to enable them to establish a system of rapid alert in regions where political situations are identified as being volatile .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
At the same time , in many developing countries , the formulation of coherent and implementable national strategies is contingent on adequate international support , technical and financial .  
Additional financial resources are called for , whether obtained through established means including increased and dependable official development assistance , better mobilization of domestic resources and greater direct foreign investment , or through innovative means .  
In spite of the difficult world economic climate , Tunisia has also managed to achieve encouraging results , illustrated in a rate of growth in national product averaging 4.8 per cent over the last four years ; an increase in non-agricultural industrial exports at an annual rate of 13 per cent ; and an improvement in employment potential , with demand for employment fully absorbed for the first time ; while at the same time the country 's financial equilibrium has been preserved and its external debt brought under control .  
The strengthening of the private sector 's role in the development process and in the creation of jobs has been accompanied by an investment promotion policy focused on a recasting of the Investment Codes into a single , better adapted and more flexible Code covering all economic sectors and the financial and fiscal reforms .  
In addition , while the State attends to the legal framework , the training of specialized personnel , the enhancement of public awareness , and the mobilization of most of the financial resources ( through the Special Fund for the Disabled created in 1988 ) , the associative sector plays a leading role in specialized education , occupational training and rehabilitation for disabled persons who can not attend a normal institution .  
Cancellation of " provision for unscheduled meetings approved in the course of the biennium " will likely be of marginal benefit and may be disruptive , since such meetings are usually scheduled taking into account already existing conference services capacity and are quite often called to consider programmes of work , budgetary , financial and other important matters .  
Following consideration as to what viable alternatives might be possible , the High Commissioner created a yearly human rights fund for field activities of $ 25-million to minimize the instability and uncertainty that has complicated current field operations , and to ensure that , when called for in future , a human rights field operation could be deployed urgently , without unnecessary delay arising from financial constraints .  
They stressed that the solution to the debt problem must go much further than the establishment of transitory relief measures and be based on a genuine joint effort between debtors and creditors without selectivity , taking into account all the dimensions of the problem and ensuring a net transfer of financial resources to indebted countries .  
They emphasized with grave concern that , while the Conference , Agenda 21 and other international instruments on environmental subjects invoked a new spirit of partnership and cooperation , four years after the Conference the required new and additional financial resources had not been allocated and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on concessional and preferential terms , scientific and technical cooperation and the appropriate dissemination of information had not materialized .  
Overcoming the many years of conflict in Angola would not only be a major blessing for a country which is friendly to us , for its people and for other States in the region of southern Africa , but would also be a substantial success for the peacemaking efforts of the United Nations and of the international community as a whole , which have invested significant human , material and financial resources in support of the Angolan peace process .  
While OIOS does not question the noble purpose of the seminars as the General Assembly has approved them , the issue of the efficient and effective use of funds for continuing to hold the seminars at a time of financial crisis for the Organization is worth objective and independent consideration .  
In paragraphs 38 to 44 of his report , the Secretary-General discusses several means of limiting the liability of the Organization , such as financial and temporal limitation , counter-claims and off-sets , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal responsibility on the part of a member of the force .  
The Council decided that , prior to the annual high-level policy dialogue , and allowing sufficient time for preparation , the Secretariat should communicate to the financial and trade institutions a report on the relevant issues to be discussed at the session , with a primary focus on the agreed theme ; and that communication should be prepared in part based on the submission of issues and questions that Member States could be invited to suggest to the Secretariat , which would then be taken into account in the preparation of the Secretariat 's report to the institutions .  
Many delegations , while supporting in general the proposals for contributions by host governments towards local office costs ( GLOC ) , requested additional information regarding the financial impact of the proposals , in particular the financial impact of applying the revised programme thresholds for providing international staff to some net contributor countries ( NCCs ) , and the impact of the three-year waiver period following graduation .  
The Administration notes that a number of measures have been taken that are in line with this recommendation : the numeric control system for LOAs has been developed and linked to the financial database to ensure that an appropriate obligating document is prepared in connection with every LOA ; miscellaneous obligating documents ( MODs ) are obligated at Headquarters and the field is provided with a monthly allotment report that reflects the disbursements and obligations against the MODs ; the modified text of LOAs now includes reference to receiving and inspection reports to facilitate identification .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,970,718 United States dollars gross ( 1,718,168 dollars net ) for the period from 16 May 1995 to 12 January 1996 ;  
The Agency would start the 1997 budget year having reduced its budget volume through accumulated austerity measures and other reductions , depleted its financial reserves and lowered overhead costs to their practical limits , and the projected cumulative gap between expenditure and income would inevitably lead to ruptures in services ;  
As had been recognized in recent major conferences convened by the United Nations , the development of developing countries required a favourable international economic environment including enhanced financial flows , better access to markets in developed countries and access to technology on a non-discriminatory , concessional and preferential basis .  
Despite the commitments made at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development on the provision of new and additional financial resources and the action agreed to within the framework of the follow-up to the Rio Conference and at the World Summit for Social Development with a view to eradicating poverty , levels of official development assistance continued to be on the decline and the target contribution of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries had become a virtual chimera .  
Like many developing countries , it was disappointed by the shortage of financial resources and by the developed countries ' failure to contribute , in clear and specific terms , the new and additional financial resources required for the successful implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Despite considerable efforts , the Commission had been unable to balance viewpoints and to catalyse decisive action by the international community , not only on financial resources but also on other cross-sectoral issues such as the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , economic instruments for sustainable development and the relation between international trade and the environment . 
Through dialogue with Member States , through coordination with the United Nations agencies that support human rights efforts , through permanent contact with regional forums , academic institutions and the leadership of the main international financial institutions , the High Commissioner has sought to ensure that the issue of human rights become a constant in the thinking and actions of the political and economic forces that govern or influence events globally .  
In preparation for legislative elections held in June , August and September 1995 and the presidential elections of December 1995 , the technical team coordinated a large civic education programme and undertook , inter alia , the preparation of an electoral budget and coordination of financial support through a United Nations trust fund established for that purpose ; preparation of an operational and logistical plan , and assistance in its implementation ; and support in the design of a communication plan and a deployment plan for registration and voting periods .  
The Committee also agreed with the Secretary-General 's view that efforts to ensure that the United Nations was equipped to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century depended on , above all , continuous , predictable and assured political and financial support from Member States .  
Such education was available at all school levels , starting with municipal and private kindergartens and including both public and private schools maintained by the national minority , which received the same financial support from the State as public schools .  
Also decides that the preparatory process for the special session of the General Assembly should be funded through the regular budget of the United Nations , bearing in mind the need to keep financial costs to a minimum , and that Governments should be invited to make extrabudgetary contributions to meet those costs ;  
In accordance with the recommendations of the General Assembly in paragraph 6 of its resolution 49 / 194 and of the Commission on Human Rights in paragraph 6 of its resolution 1995 / 54 , the High Commissioner , by a letter of 28 August 1995 addressed to all relevant United Nations agencies and financial institutions , has sought to explore possibilities for obtaining from such institutions , acting within their mandates , technical and financial assistance for supporting the Organization 's efforts to promote human rights and the rule of law .  
A sustained commitment of all relevant parts of the United Nations towards increased cooperation under the guidance of the High Commissioner , increased resources for both technical and financial assistance and continued substantive programme development are required in order to provide an effective response to the growing demand by the Member States for cooperation with the United Nations regarding the rule of law .  
However , in spite of donor support and encouragement , progress has been slow in most of these areas for two main reasons : lack of human and financial capacity to manage such complex reforms ; and political sensitivity , which call for broad consultations and negotiations involving Parliament and civil society , thereby further contributing to the complexity of the reform process .  
On the question of limitations of liability ( para . 38 ) , given the substantial increase in the number and amount of third-party claims against the United Nations , the General Assembly might wish to consider , inter alia , financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal liability of the member of the force .  
The establishment of adequate internal controls at an early stage was a key requirement which should be borne in mind for future peacekeeping missions , since it would provide reasonable assurance that financial and administrative matters were properly handled during the life of the mission .  
His delegation supported the continuing decentralization of functions which , in particular , increased managerial responsibility at the local level , and agreed that delegated management authority must be accompanied by delegated financial authority , subject , however , to the overall authority of the Office of Human Resources Management . 
While it was gratifying to note that the percentage of women in posts subject to geographical distribution had risen by 1 per cent over the past year , his delegation was concerned that , because of the financial crisis , it had been difficult for the Organization to meet its targets for the percentage of women in decision-making and policy-making posts .  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
At the regional level , the Economic Commission for Africa played a leading role in assisting Member States in their implementation of the Platform , focusing human and financial resources on enhancing women 's political leadership role and economic empowerment and promoting their legal and human rights .  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Non-Annex I Parties are thus encouraged to formulate cost-effective national , and where appropriate regional , programmes aiming at the improvement of the quality of local emission factors and appropriate data gathering , and to submit requests for financial and technical assistance to the interim operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention in addition to their request for support for the preparation of their initial communications .  
In providing the financial resources needed by developing country Parties to meet the agreed full incremental costs of implementing measures covered by Article 4.1 of the Convention in accordance with Article 4.3 , take steps to facilitate this provision of financial resources , including the enhancement of transparency and the flexible and pragmatic application of its concept of incremental costs on a case-by-case basis ;  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 13 above , their respective share in the amount of 115,373,000 dollars gross ( 113,866,300 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 227,406,878 dollars gross ( 227,911,279 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 December 1995 ;  
The fundamental importance of the law of the sea institutions for international peace and security , the peaceful settlement of disputes , the sustainable development of marine resources and the protection of the environment has allowed them to evolve successfully , despite the increasing financial difficulties for Governments in providing for institutional development at the international level .  
The recommendation was based on the following needs : " ( a ) to better identify priorities for action at the global level to promote conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment ; ( b ) for better coordination among the relevant United Nations organizations and intergovernmental financial institutions ; ( c ) to ensure sound scientific , environmental , economic and social advice on these issues . "  
Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
For , as has also been emphasized by the Acting Chairman of the OAU , how can Africa develop if the financial flows towards the continent decline every day , if official development assistance , which is already declining , is subject to more and more conditions , if the burden of debt continues to increase , if African commodities have difficulty finding access to international markets and if the trend towards reducing investment in our countries is expanding and new capital is still not coming in ?  
The reform and structural adjustment programmes to which African countries are committed have all been multidimensional in nature , including measures for domestic economic and commercial liberalization aimed at improving financial management , expanding the tax base and enhancing efficiency and transparency in the fiscal system .  
In the short term , there was an urgent need for additional financial resources to alleviate human suffering and environmental damage and to find solutions to the political problems that caused population displacements .  
Providing the programme planning , financial , personnel , legal , management , administrative and general services that are essential for the rational selection of work items and allocating resources among them and for the effective , economic and efficient performance of the services and functions of the Secretariat , within the legal framework of regulations , rules and policies adopted by the Assembly .  
He understood that the staff felt threatened and demoralized in the budget climate created by the Organization 's response to its financial crisis , by the renewed emphasis on performance issues , the possibility that the redeployment process and the buy-out programme could lead to involuntary separations , the resignations of some long-term staff , the perception that pay levels were uncompetitive , the high percentage of loaned personnel and the frequent depiction , outside the Organization , of the international civil service as a bloated bureaucracy .  
In this connection , the Government of Burundi also requests , through you , direct proof and circumstantial evidence from the International Commission of Inquiry concerning the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye , which was " planned beforehand " , and concerning the " acts of genocide against the Tutsi minority " , as well as material and financial assistance from the United Nations to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Justice , which will play a fundamental role in the planned judicial process .  
Despite the negative effect of the financial situation of the United Nations , as pointed out by the Assistant Secretary-General for Public Information , great progress had been made in improving the work of the Department and innovating when implementing its programmes , thanks no doubt to its links with educational institutions , think tanks and national and local governmental institutions , as well as international media organizations .  
LDCs also suffer from an extremely limited internal savings capacity and underdeveloped financial markets , geographical disadvantages ( as in the case of many land-locked and small island LDCs ) , inadequate infrastructure , poor communications and low education levels which are reflected , inter alia , in weak managerial and administrative capacity and in a severe shortage of skilled and trained manpower .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 and 50 / 10 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Invites donor countries and multilateral financial institutions to give high priority to the eradication of poverty in their assistance budgets and programmes , on either a bilateral or multilateral basis , and also invites the relevant funds , programmes and agencies of the United Nations system to support developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , in their efforts to achieve the overall goal of eradicating poverty and ensuring basic social services , through , inter alia , the elaboration and implementation of anti-poverty programmes ;  
Calls upon Governments to invite and encourage the active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , local community groups and the media , as well as financial and non-profit organizations for the implementation of the Platform for Action ;  
The Bank viewed land ownership and natural resources management ; technical assistance and training ; basic investment in education , health and other aspects of human capital that were adapted to indigenous peoples and their cultures ; and better access to goods and services , including financial resources , as closely related factors which warranted special attention in tackling the poverty and marginalization of Latin America 's indigenous people .  
Recommends that the next informal round table be held in the Latin American and Caribbean region to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa so as to be close to the reality and needs of the developing countries , without losing sight of global perspectives , and invites Member States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the regular convening of informal round tables on communication for development , with the full participation of the international financial institutions at the country level ;  
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
In particular , the successful methodology developed in the agricultural sector will be applied to the other sectors with the intention of establishing a fully functional information and progress review mechanism by the beginning of December to be presented to the next consultative group meeting of bilateral and multilateral donors and financial institutions .  
The Heads of State again emphasize the special importance of developing and extracting the rich natural resources of their countries , in the first instance natural gas , petroleum and hydro-energy resources , and called for urgent measures to conduct joint projects for laying pipelines and electricity transmission lines to deliver energy to world markets , with the involvement in these projects of the States concerned , international financial institutions and State and private structures .  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Stresses that the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued through the reallocation of resources already designated for development purposes ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
INCERA ( Costa Rica ) , speaking on behalf of the Group 77 and China , said that the strengthening of oversight and audit functions was a fundamental means of achieving the efficient , transparent and responsible management of the Organization 's resources , particularly in the light of the current financial crisis .  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Proposals aimed at enhancing broader cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policies among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , as a means of promoting a stable international economic environment conducive to sustained economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
Thus , it should improve and support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development , concentrating on the needs of the population and the eradication of poverty .  
In subprogramme 8.2 , on environment and social development management , it should be mentioned that the lack of financial and technological resources , information and technical knowledge and the debt crisis and unemployment are factors that have a negative impact on the environment and social development , as well as that eradication of poverty is of maximum importance for the developing countries and constitutes a basic condition for attaining sustainable development .  
Decides that the preparatory process for the special session of the General Assembly should be funded through the regular budget of the United Nations , bearing in mind the need to keep financial costs to a minimum , and that Governments should be invited to make extrabudgetary contributions to meet those costs ;  
Emphasizing the importance of cooperation and international solidarity in supporting the efforts being made by the peoples and Governments of Central America for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace , and the need to strengthen the new programme of cooperation and economic , technical and financial assistance for Central America in the light of the new situation in the region ,

With reference to the 20 / 20 initiative embodied in the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , it had been agreed that the initial target was 0.7 per cent of gross national product , and that the ability of the Government of a developing country to devote 20 per cent of its expenditure to basic social services would depend on the level of economic development , its debt burden and other financial commitments .  
He also welcomed the work accomplished by the Special Committee at its most recent session with regard to the formulation of guiding principles for the establishment and conduct of peacekeeping operations and the consideration of practical steps to ensure that future peacekeeping operations would have a sound logistical and financial basis .  
While the primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security lay with the United Nations , regional organizations could also make a valuable contribution to facilitating the peaceful resolution of conflicts .  However , regional initiatives , especially in developing countries , had so far been constrained by logistical and financial difficulties .  
His Government reiterated its commitment to work with the United Nations in matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security in the hope that some day all the Organization 's human and financial resources could be devoted to encouraging social development and improving the living conditions of people everywhere .  
It is acknowledged that the Fund of UNDCP requires an operating reserve to ensure the financial viability and integrity of the Fund and to cover : downward fluctuations or shortfalls in resources ; uneven cash flows ; increases in actual costs as compared with planning estimates or fluctuations in delivery ; and contingencies such as final expenditure ( including liquidating liabilities ) and unforeseen needs which may arise .  
Reaffirms the importance of ensuring the uniform and consistent application of the Convention and a coordinated approach to its overall implementation , and of strengthening technical cooperation and financial assistance for this purpose , stresses once again the continuing importance of the Secretary-General 's efforts to these ends , and reiterates its invitation to the competent international organizations and other international bodies to support these objectives ;  
The committee is currently focusing its work on a review of Liberian electoral laws and constitutional provisions ; the establishment of an independent and impartial administrative mechanism for the management of the electoral process ; the role of the international community in the holding of elections ; and the technical , logistic and financial assistance necessary to support the electoral process .  
He commended the Commissioner 's efforts to restructure the Centre for Human Rights and emphasized the need for extensive consideration of that question by Member States and guidance by the General Assembly before action was taken .  The right to development was a fundamental human right and must be fully respected and implemented on a firm financial basis .  
Reports should inter alia indicate the activities and programmes developed in the framework of international cooperation , including at the bilateral and regional levels , the areas addressed , the target groups identified , the financial assistance provided and / or received and the priorities considered , as well as any evaluation made of the progress achieved and of the difficulties encountered .

The Statistical Commission expressed its appreciation for the report of the Task Force ; recognized the importance of finance statistics for economic analysis and policy-making ; and emphasized the need to produce consistent standards on monetary and financial statistics that were harmonized with the concepts of the 1993 SNA .  
In the context of the requirements established for the European Monetary Union , Eurostat and EMI have identified a broad range of actions for financial statistics that include the development of a methodology for monetary statistics clean of cross-border business and reflecting the adoption of harmonized concepts and definitions ( residency , currency breakdown , coverage ) , all within the framework of the European System of Accounts .  
The draft manual on monetary and financial statistics and an annotated outline of the revised Manual on Government Finance Statistics have been sent for comment to national statistical offices ; central banks and ministries of finance of member countries ; international organizations , including members of the Task Force ; and other interested parties .  
Consideration of policies and procedures for the acceptance of gratis personnel can not be separated from the overall financial situation of the Organization and the present environment of increasing demands coupled with growing budgetary constraints , leading programme managers to seek and accept offers of gratis personnel in order to offset declining authorized resources in the implementation of the approved work programme .  
In the area of backstopping of peacekeeping operations ( financed by the peacekeeping support account ) or the start-up of the international tribunals , for instance , the General Assembly had , until recently , agreed only to ad hoc and temporary financial arrangements under which it has been difficult for the Secretariat to recruit staff in a planned and orderly manner .  
The financial liability involved in the acceptance of gratis personnel relates to costs for secretarial and administrative backstopping , equipment , supplies , office space , utilities , communications , legal and medical services , as well as costs for official travel , daily subsistence allowance and participation in United Nations training and language programmes .  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 13 above , their respective share in the amount of 115,373,000 dollars gross ( 113,866,300 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 227,406,878 dollars gross ( 227,911,279 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 December 1995 ;  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 and 50 / 10 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries , 1 .  Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General [ 1 ] on the implementation of resolution 50 / 10 ;  
Urges Member States carefully to consider the problems posed by the international aspects of corrupt practices , especially as regards international economic activities carried out by corporate entities , and to study appropriate legislative and regulatory measures to ensure the transparency and integrity of financial systems and transactions carried out by such corporate entities ;  
Public officials , to the extent required by the officials ' position , shall in accordance with laws or administrative policies , declare business , commercial and financial interests , or activities undertaken for financial gain that may raise a possible conflict of interest .  In situations of possible or perceived conflict of interest between public officials ' duties and private interests they shall comply with the measures established to reduce or eliminate such conflict of interest .  
Calls upon Governments to invite and encourage the active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , local community groups and the media , as well as financial and non-profit organizations for the implementation of the Platform for Action ;  
GORITA ( Romania ) said that partnership , which was the key to the success of the globalization of the world economy , did not mean just partnership between developed and developing countries ; it should encompass all the potential actors involved : intergovernmental organizations , the United Nations funds and programmes , the international financial institutions , employers ' representatives and civil society .  
Noting that the international community had held a series of conferences to address such important issues as human rights , children , women , social development and the environment - to name but a few - he wondered whether it would be prepared to devote the same degree of attention and political commitment to such issues as the external economic environment , transfer of financial resources for development and transfer of technology , all of which were crucial to the development of the developing countries . 
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
His delegation called upon the major Powers to stop providing military , financial and strategic support , as well as direct and indirect financing for the construction of new settlements , since that posed a threat to a just and lasting peace in the region .  
Considering in particular the fact that , in order to respond to those urgent humanitarian needs , the Government of the Comoros , in the absence of other resources , had to reallocate as a matter of great urgency a major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State and the financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes ,  
While Government and other stakeholders have been dedicating resources to the development of new financial instruments to address sustainable forestry , the huge shifts in global capital markets over the last five years suggest that the main issue for capturing private sector funding for forest management is not developing new financial instruments , but linking existing investment flows more directly to sustainability and with sustainable forest management in particular . 
His delegation shared the concern about the dire financial crisis faced by UNRWA and was gratified to note that UNRWA was considering a number of innovative approaches to expand its traditional donor base .  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
Acknowledges the interest in holding the next informal round table in the Latin American and Caribbean region , to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa , and invites interested States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the convening of these informal round tables on communication for development , with the participation of the international financial institutions and the regional banks , at the country level ;  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring of sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that the implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued at the expense of development resources , inter alia , through contribution by bilateral donors to the Trust Fund for the implementation of the Initiative , and welcomes the commitment made to provide such additional resources and bearing in mind the needs of developing countries as they are being addressed through ongoing development activities ;  
Decides that the preparatory process for the special session of the General Assembly should be funded through the regular budget of the United Nations , bearing in mind the need to keep financial costs to a minimum , and that Governments should be invited to make extrabudgetary contributions to meet those costs . " 
Recommendations and decisions of ICSC or resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly concerning the conditions of service of common system staff were not automatically binding , for the following reasons : the organizations were in different financial and budgetary situations ; staff recruitment and retention difficulties varied ; and each common system organization was an independent and sovereign intergovernmental organization and should have the final word regarding the conditions of service of its staff .  
These included macroeconomic stability , high rates of domestic saving , maintenance of sound financial intermediaries , high priority given to human resource development ( especially to high _ quality primary and secondary education ) , competitive exchange rates , export orientation , a supportive environment which rewarded entrepreneurship and allowed open and constructive dialogue between government and the private sector regarding objectives and policies , and governance which balanced the promotion of social cohesion and consensus with that of competition between individuals and companies .  
The spokesman for the African Group ( Morocco ) said that it was difficult to be optimistic about the possibilities for the African continent to achieve economic and social development , given the negative net external financial flows experienced by the region .  
The end of the recession in the industrial countries had favourably influenced exports from the region , which had also received a considerable inflow of foreign direct investment and other external financial flows , although these had remained concentrated in a few countries .  
In view of the acute external financial constraints and low levels of domestic savings in most African countries , there was a pressing need to improve their capacity to attract foreign investment , in the process drawing investors ' attention to the considerable opportunities existing in all major economic sectors , namely natural resources , agro-industry , other manufacturing , tourism , other services , and infrastructure .  
While such authoritarianism on the political front should not be replicated in other developing countries , the East Asian experience did show the positive role which Governments could play in development by providing not only a good macroeconomic environment but also policies giving appropriate importance to agriculture and basic social services , as well as to the establishment of effective and secure financial systems . 
He called for adequate and timely funding of multilateral financial institutions and organizations which provided a significant part of the LDCs ' external financing and innovative approaches for increasing foreign direct investment ( FDI ) flows to the LDCs .  
In spite of all these setbacks , African countries had pressed ahead with efforts to facilitate the effective development and utilization of human resources , harness their vast natural resources , mobilize both domestic and foreign financial resources for development and strengthen regional and subregional cooperation and integration .  
IFAD was already supporting countries in the early stages of implementing the Convention through the formulation of investment projects at the local level , including projects that attempted to provide an enabling environment in which farmers could help themselves , including the development of rural financial systems , demand-driven technology development , and decentralized institutions for community action .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but that face economic hardship ;  
At the end of the 12-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the special account until payment is effected ;  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
" Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Stresses that the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and in that context calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on human settlements development and urban management , and intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries within the framework of paragraphs 203 and 204 of the Habitat Agenda in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Invites donor countries and multilateral financial institutions to give high priority to the eradication of poverty in their assistance budgets and programmes , on either a bilateral or multilateral basis , and also invites the relevant funds , programmes and agencies of the United Nations system to support developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , in their efforts to achieve the overall goal of eradicating poverty and ensuring basic social services , through , inter alia , the elaboration and implementation of anti-poverty programmes ;  
Recommends that the next informal round table be held in the Latin American and Caribbean region to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa so as to be close to the reality and needs of the developing countries , without losing sight of global perspectives , and invites Member States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the regular convening of informal round tables on communication for development , with the full participation of the international financial institutions at the country level ;  
Acknowledges the interest in holding the next informal round table in the Latin American and Caribbean region , to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa , and invites interested States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the convening of these informal round tables on communication for development , with the participation of the international financial institutions and the regional banks , at the country level ;  
" Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter , in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
Significant human and financial resources are being devoted by the international community to assistance in mine clearance , which is , by its nature , a long-term task ; to efficient and effective demining programmes where the primary emphasis is on the development of national mine-clearance capacities by afflicted countries ; to mine-awareness programmes ; and to the rehabilitation and reintegration into society of victims of landmines .  
The maintenance of a significant United Nations presence in Haiti in the form of military elements , particularly against the backdrop of the far more drastic crisis situations in other regions of the world and the extremely difficult financial situation of the Organization , could be perceived as a manifestation of double standards , especially when one takes into account the totally different attitude towards other truly critical and more volatile flashpoints .  
In this regard , operative paragraph 4 of today 's draft resolution ( S / 1996 / 1002 ) is essential because close cooperation between the Government of Haiti and international financial institutions is expected to permit the mobilization of additional financial support to assist the economic , social and institutional development which is so needed for Haiti to weather the winds of instability .  
Botswana has always maintained that the international community must always aim at ensuring that the financial , material and human resources invested in the cause of peace do not go to waste due to premature withdrawal of a peacekeeping mission .  
" Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
" Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Stresses that the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued through the reallocation of resources already designated for development purposes ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Proposals aimed at enhancing broader cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policies among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , as a means of promoting a stable international economic environment conducive to sustained economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
" Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
Considering in particular the fact that , in order to respond to those urgent humanitarian needs , the Government of the Comoros , in the absence of other resources , had to reallocate as a matter of great urgency a major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State and the financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes ,  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,202,700 United States dollars gross ( 973,100 dollars net ) for the period from 1 December 1994 to 30 November 1995 ;

Firmly upholds the validity of the principles cited in comparable situations by certain Governments which imposed the embargo against Burundi , namely , that the imposition on a State of an economic , commercial or financial blockade also has adverse consequences for the sovereignty and interests of other countries and that the imposition of one State 's jurisdiction on another State is contrary to the principles of international law ;  
Once again solemnly appeals to the community of States , the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to redouble their commitment and take further initiatives to mobilize the political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources needed to end the Burundian crisis definitively and , thereby , to bring these collective efforts to fruition in a genuine national reconciliation of the Burundian people ;  
Kenya shares the legitimate concerns of many Member States regarding the need to minimize the operational costs of the institutions we have created and to adopt an evolutionary and cost-effective approach that takes into account the increasing financial difficulties of Governments in providing for institutional development at the international level .  We believe , however , that it is crucial for the international community to provide these new institutions with sufficient resources to enable them to discharge their important functions .  
Regarding the financial aspects of this project , it is anticipated that although the revised project cost of construction will exceed the amount approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 45 / 248 A of 21 December 1990 , the additional requirement , excluding claims , could be covered , with the approval of the General Assembly , by interest earned on the construction-in-progress funds and , therefore , no additional appropriation would be required under the regular budget beyond the amount of $ 107,576,900 originally approved .

The Panel recognized that there is a need to promote new and innovative forms of finance and [ combine ] [ complement ] [ facilitate ] all forms of finance , at the public , private , international , domestic and local levels and to combine them with existing ones , as well as to ensure the predictability and continuity of flow of financial resources .

The Panel also noted that assessments represented a significant financial and technical burden , in particular for developing countries , and that they should [ therefore be carried out in the most cost-effective manner ] [ be assisted by developed countries and international organizations in terms of financial resources and technological transfer ] .  
The Panel recognized the importance of the [ global ] services provided by forests relating to , for example , biological diversity and climate [ change ] [ regulation ] , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate these values into [ financial support ] [ monetary terms ] to encourage forest [ owners ] [ dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities ] to [ conserve and ] sustainably manage forests .

Educational materials developed at the international and regional levels should benefit from the review and input of national focal points and national resource and training centres and should be made available to national and local programmes for translation , cultural adaptation , testing and revision , with the financial and technical assistance of international and regional programmes .  
Under the coordination of the High Commissioner and the respective national focal points for human rights education , and according to the plan developed following the survey , Governments and national non-governmental organizations , universities and institutes , will be called upon to carry out translation , publication and distribution of appropriate versions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , with technical and financial assistance from international organizations and programmes , where necessary .  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,

The commitment of the developed countries to ensure an adequate flow of financial resources and the transfer of environmentally sound technology , which were crucial in order for the developing countries to implement Agenda 21 , had been left unfulfilled .  
While expressing its full support for UNDCP , his delegation was greatly concerned by the attitude taken towards that body by some donor countries , and stressed that countries with a high level of domestic consumption of illicit drugs should continue to bear a fair share of the increasing financial burden of UNDCP .  
Emphasizing the importance of cooperation and international solidarity in supporting the efforts being made by the peoples and Governments of Central America for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace , and the need to strengthen the new programme of cooperation and economic , technical and financial assistance for Central America in the light of the new situation in the region ,

Welcomes the recent initiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions , including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and the ongoing process at the international level regarding debt relief , as appropriate , for developing countries , and calls upon the international community , including international financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives that will contribute to a durable solution of the debt problems of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to achieve social development ;  
Thus , it should support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development .  
Since some countries faced financial constraints in that regard , his delegation wholeheartedly supported the proposal contained in the draft resolution prepared by the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee that a special fund should be established to finance the participation of representatives from low-income developing countries .  
The participation of international financial institutions or export credit agencies may facilitate the project sponsors task of raising funds in the international financial market by providing commercial banks with protection against a variety of political risks , including , inter alia , the failure of the host Government to make agreed payments , to make available sufficient foreign exchange or to grant necessary regulatory approvals . 
Moreover , at a time of increasing demand but decreasing resources within the United Nations for international action , the potential of regional groups to contribute political , diplomatic , financial , material and military resources has taken on even greater importance . 
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .

Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
Such comprehensive and balanced reform should be constructed on three pillars , that is , reform in the political area , including the Security Council , reform in the economic area , especially on development , and reform in the financial area , focusing on how truly fair and equitable methods of financing the activities of the Organization are to be realized .  
That exclusion was largely acceptable because insolvencies of financial services institutions usually required prompt and discrete action ( for instance to avoid massive withdrawals of deposits ) and were , for that reason , administered under special regulatory regimes in various States .  
Subsequently , the Commission adopted resolution 1997 / 10 , entitled " Effects on the full enjoyment of human rights of the economic adjustment policies arising from foreign debt and , in particular , on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development " , in which it requested the Secretary-General to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session , after high-level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies and intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon .  
As a result of our examination , we are of the opinion that the financial statements present fairly the financial position of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research as at 31 December 1996 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the financial period then ended ; that they were prepared in accordance with the stated accounting policies which were applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding financial period , and that the transactions were in accordance with the Financial Regulations and the relevant legislative authority . 
In respect of such currencies , the financial statements prepared at such intervals as may be prescribed by the Controller under delegation of authority from the Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management shall reflect the cash , investments , unpaid pledges and current accounts receivable and payable in currencies other than United States dollars , translated at the applicable United Nations rates of exchange in effect as at the date of the statements .  
In the interests of prudent financial management , up to half of the value of conditional pledges from Governments and firm pledges made by organizations of established repute are recognized as income at the time the pledge is received .  
To transform the Gambia into a financial centre , a tourist paradise , a trading export-oriented agricultural and manufacturing nation , thriving on free market policies and a vibrant private sector , sustained by a well-educated , trained , skilled , healthy , self-reliant and enterprising population , and guaranteeing a well-balanced ecosystem and a decent standard of living for one and all , under a system of government based on the consent of the citizenry .  
We must therefore concentrate our efforts on the causes , such as poverty , armed conflicts , economic sanctions , economic imbalances , ethnic conflicts , environmental problems , desertification , deforestation , inadequate international cooperation and , above all , the problems of indebtedness , technology transfers , the provision of international financial aid to developing countries and the exploitation of basic resources and unfair terms of trade , all of which lead to greater flows of refugees across international borders , as the current international situation shows .  
We have taken measures to consolidate parliamentary democracy through constitutional means ; to restore financial equilibrium through austerity and structural adjustments while enhancing business incentives and economic liberalization ; to combat corruption , drugs and terrorism which is often sponsored from abroad through effective law enforcement and speedy and fair justice .  
The fact that we have been able to emerge with dignity from the most critical phase in our independent development is , to a large extent , to the credit of the United Nations and its specialized agencies , which provided Georgia not only with moral support but with specific and timely financial and technical assistance . 
And for peace to be truly meaningful it must also be translated into concrete improvements in the living conditions of the long-suffering Palestinian people ; hence , there is an urgent need for economic , financial and technical assistance by the international community .  
Mr . Galu \ x { ea98 } a ( Czech Republic ) : Although the Czech Republic , as an associated country , endorsed the statement of the European Union presented by the representative of Luxembourg , I would like to make a few additional comments on this point .  The reason is that the situation in the former Yugoslavia , specifically in Bosnia and Herzegovina , is a long-term priority of Czech foreign policy , reflected in our intensive political , military , material and financial support for all efforts to bring stability to the region .  
It is relevant here to highlight the need for the international community to continue its cooperation with the Central American countries by providing the required economic , financial and technical assistance in sustained fashion and on favourable terms in order to make the goals of the programme of sustainable development in Central America achievable .  
Emphasizes the importance of supporting and strengthening the new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities laid down in the new sustainable development programme for the region .  
We would like first and foremost to express our gratitude to those States and international organizations that have continued to provide financial and material support to Djibouti , particularly those that participated in and made pledges during the round table on Djibouti held at Geneva in May 1997 .  
The international community is devoting considerable human and financial resources to assistance in mine clearing , which by its very nature is a long-term job ; to efficient mine clearance programmes in which the primary emphasis needs to be on helping the afflicted countries to develop national mine clearance capability ; to mine-awareness programmes ; and to the rehabilitation and reintegration into society of landmine victims .  
The achievement of that critical objective must of necessity be accompanied by a concomitant technological and financial commitment by the international community to accelerate the pace of the demining operations already under way and of all those that can not be implemented because of lack of sufficient resources .  
Regional and international arms races and military expenditure do not merely threaten international peace and security and the stability of States ; they also absorb tremendous amounts of national economic and financial resources , particularly in the developing countries that so sorely need those resources to achieve their aspirations to economic and social development .  
National mechanisms for control of the production and marketing of light weapons , and the elimination of illicit trafficking , need to be harmonized at the international level with a view to achieving effective financial control without duplication of procedures and needless bureaucratization .  
Developed countries and the international community at large , including relevant United Nations organizations , are urged to assist developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , including through technical cooperation and financial assistance , in their efforts to improve the ability and the competitive capacity to participate in global economic development and alleviate unemployment .  
The Commission calls upon Governments and the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and to use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including on concessional and grant terms .  
Copper prices , additionally , lost considerable ground after disclosures of substantial losses by a large Japanese company in trades of derivative financial instruments linked to copper , amid widely publicized speculation that the company controlled large unreported stocks of copper that had been used to manipulate market prices and prices of the derivative instruments .  
Nevertheless , the prudent advice for policy makers in capital-importing countries would be , first , to seek to build and retain investor confidence through their own cautious macroeconomic policy-making and , second , to remember that international financial markets can become highly volatile and subject to herd instincts and thus capable of moving vast volumes of funds out of , as well as into , countries on short notice .  
Since countries each have different relative strengths and all have limited financial means , considerable benefit can be realized from sharing international efforts to develop resource and environmental accounting concepts and methods .  
Typically : host institution may not benefit from widespread local support ; staff may be divided as to advisability of foreign assistance ; there may be solid resistance to necessary change ; circumstances ( financial and material ) may be poor and so on .  
At the same time the Commission further defined the mandate of the expert by requesting him to coordinate his efforts with other international actors in the field , to prepare a comprehensive plan concerning the excavation of mass graves and the exhumation of mortal remains , and to assume responsibility for securing appropriate support , including financial assistance , for these tasks .  
Weak technological infrastructures , a severe shortage of qualified human resources and limited financial means explain in part the persistent nature of the problem confronting many developing countries .  
In this sense , international cooperation , including financial and technical support , is a duty of States in the context of the HIV / AIDS epidemic and industrialized countries are encouraged to act in a spirit of solidarity in assisting developing countries to meet the challenges of implementing the Guidelines .  
One year after D + 60 , beneficiaries of both procedures shall become eligible for longer-term services provided by the Government , including financial , technical , legal and employment assistance and assistance in the areas of education , training and production projects with a view to ensuring their lasting integration into the economic , social and cultural life of the country , on the same terms as the rest of the Guatemalan population .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and inadequate access to technologies may hinder implementation and compliance with international legal instruments .  
Factors contributing to this deficiency include lack of political will , unavailability of sufficient financial means , lack of full understanding of the exact obligations of the instrument , and the compressed time schedule of many negotiations , which may leave room for multiple interpretations of the agreed text , and this may give rise to potential disputes .  
For example , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia both reported that several countries in their region expressed strong concerns regarding their problems in the implementation of and compliance with conventions due to the administrative burden imposed , and the lack of institutional and technical capacities and financial resources .  
The Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1993 / 14 , requested the Secretary _ General to prepare basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment and economic , social and cultural rights which could serve as a basis for a continued dialogue between human rights bodies and the international financial institutions .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
To realize the concrete and achievable goals clearly set out by the Conference , the mobilization of resources must be placed high on the global development agenda , and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
It will also include continuing financial contributions to the international community 's variegated activities in the humanitarian and economic and social fields , without which it will not be possible to restore lasting peace and security in the region .  
Many countries ( which have suffered and continue to suffer great material and financial damage as a result of sanctions ) are therefore completely justified in their desire to elaborate basic criteria and conditions for the application and implementation of mandatory sanctions , and develop ways and means of preventing the adverse consequences of such sanctions or , at least , reducing them to a minimum .  
Both national and international non-governmental organizations also feel that their growing role and contribution in environmental and other economic and social fields is not matched by equal growth in financial , political and technical support from Governments and international organizations .  
Although there are numerous examples of good practices by business and industry , the number of companies that are making strides in becoming sustainable development enterprises is small relative to the global total , a disappointing trend given that business and industry is the single most dominant factor influencing the direction of investments and financial flows , as well as the type of products produced and the processes with which they are made . 
The response of individual organizations of the United Nations system to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 's sustainable development agenda is assessed in terms of the three basic functions of intergovernmental organizations : ( a ) policy development , ( b ) the collection , synthesis , analysis and dissemination of data and information to inform action at all levels and ( c ) the delivery of technical and financial support to strengthen human and institutional capabilities at national and regional levels .  
Those mechanisms will have to be established in a broad and realistic manner , with the help of international cooperation , and will have to cover not only financial compensation but also measures to support and assist those families and communities which suffered the worst consequences of the internal armed conflict .  
Through its special hardship programme , UNRWA provided material and financial aid to refugee families who met the UNRWA criteria of being without a male adult medically fit to earn an income and without other financial support sufficient to cover basic needs , which represented 5.4 per cent of the registered refugee population .  
This national undertaking calls for an implementation strategy that sets realistic priorities for gradual fulfilment of the various aspects of the Peace Agreements as and when the political , institutional , financial and technical bases for their implementation are established ,  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
It should be noted that , for the purposes of the present exercise , all official development finance committed for development assistance is assumed to be dedicated to sustainable development , so that analysis focuses on any changes in the allocation of financial assistance among the economic , social and environmental components of sustainable development that may have been made in response to the series of global conferences beginning with the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and other determinants of aid composition .  
In response it was noted that the adjective " financial " had a narrow meaning in a number of legal systems , as related to transactions with currency , securities or stocks in the financial market .  Also the adjective " commercial " , which was used in some legal systems to refer to transactions covered by a particular body of law sometimes referred to as " commercial law " , might be interpreted as excluding certain categories of debtors whose transactions were not qualified as " commercial affairs " in those legal systems .  
The project has six immediate objectives : ( a ) increased awareness and improved understanding of the money-laundering phenomenon and acceptance of the need for countermeasures ; ( b ) introduction of relevant legislation , inter alia , promoting mutual legal assistance ; ( c ) improved global infrastructure , including the delivery of training services ; ( d ) improved capacity of legal and related law enforcement systems , including the establishment of financial intelligence units or similar bodies ; ( e ) reduced financial system vulnerability ; and ( f ) improved process of performance evaluation .  
This acknowledgement is given concrete meaning through the incorporation of the legal principle of common but differentiated responsibility in paragraph 4 of article 20 , which makes the obligations and commitments of developing countries contingent upon the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology .  This overriding priority is apparent in every aspect of the development and implementation of the Convention 's principles .  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Welcomes the recent initiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions , including the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and the ongoing process at the international level regarding debt relief , as appropriate , for developing countries , and calls upon the international community , including international financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives that will contribute to a durable solution of the debt problems of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to achieve social development ;  
In particular , the country had witnessed during the war forms of crimes that , given their sophistication and the means employed , were classified as organized criminal activities , in particular illicit trafficking in stolen cars , passing of counterfeit banknotes , mostly United States dollars and deutsche mark , and suspicious financial transactions that were considered to cover up money - laundering schemes .  
Particularly relevant was the legislation enacted to control money-laundering and criminal assets in general , which included a broad number of criminal activities whose revenues were to be disguised through money-laundering schemes , the reversal of the onus probandi as to the source of the assets for those who were sentenced for one of the crimes covered by the law and the obligation for financial institutions to report any suspect transaction to the competent authorities .  
Major criminal activities in which organized transnational crime was engaged were violent behaviour and the use of bribery , graft and extortion that could lead to the subversion of the political , social and economic infrastructure , drug trafficking , terrorist activities , kidnapping , prostitution , counterfeiting of currencies , manipulation of financial institutions and markets , international money-laundering and financial fraud , arms smuggling , alien smuggling and computer crime .  
His Government welcomed new mechanisms for funding and for improved financial management and supported the current reforms of the administrative and financial structure which had the potential to alleviate the financial burdens of the Organization . However , the objective of the reform must be to improve performance ; the downsizing of the Secretariat must be designed to make it more efficient and less bureaucratic and should not lead to any impairment of its effectiveness .  
A number of members of the Committee expressed concern that in the current situation of dwindling financial resources throughout the United Nations system , there was a tendency in many organizations to cut the funding for public information activities , as public information work was difficult to define in quantitative terms .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends but that face economic hardship ;  
Although more countries are adopting the programme approach , constraints identified in the UNDP 1996 internal assessment included : ( a ) a lack of clarity and training in the subject ; ( b ) the complexity of the instrument , including procedures for financial management ; ( c ) a lack of guidance on how Governments should evaluate their own programmes and conduct capacity assessments in the public sector and civil society ; ( d ) the need to harmonize procedures of donors at country level .  
The new UNDP structure will reflect an effort to recognize three distinct components or functions : headquarters , being those units whose functions concentrate on organizational policy , global advocacy , management oversight and quality control and global resource mobilization ; operating units , comprising the country offices and the regional bureaux ; and common administrative and financial services .  
This unique financial arrangement has enabled UNDP / PAPP to finance its staff of 125 , largely composed of highly skilled Palestinian technical , engineering and programming professionals , and enhanced by tapping the Junior Professional Officer ( JPO ) Programme , thanks to funding received from a number of bilateral donors .  IX .  
UNCTAD provides inputs to annual reports prepared under the leadership of DESIPA to the Second Committee of the General Assembly and to the Economic and Social Council ( recurrent reports : external debt , net flows and transfer of resources between developing and developed countries , global financial integration , and integration of economies in transition into the world economy ; non-recurrent publications : various , depending upon the agenda ) . 
That resolution reaffirmed the priority of the Programme ( para . 3 ) , requested the Secretary-General to strengthen it further by providing it with the resources necessary for the full implementation of its mandate ( para . 6 ) , called upon States and United Nations and other international , regional and national funding agencies to make significant financial contributions for operational activities of the Programme , and encouraged all States to make voluntary contributions for that purpose to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Fund .  
The role of IMF was to foster fiscal consolidation ; firm anti _ inflationary policies , liberalization of financial sectors and pursuit of a realistic exchange rate ; opening up of the economy to international trade , foreign capital and competition ; price liberalization ; and public enterprise reform . a world economy dominated by the rich industrialized countries . 
The general basis for securing sustainable development is the presence of adequate institutions , knowledge , skills and access to technology and financial resources , which will need to converge in the design and demonstration of sustainable - that is , responsible in a long-term perspective - ways of managing the environment , producing goods and services , meeting basic needs , and improving the economic and social standards of living for the world as a whole , especially for the poorest communities . 
The Trust Fund so established is open to voluntary financial contributions from States , inter-governmental organizations , regional economic integration organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations as well as natural and juridical persons .  
While recognizing that forest land rehabilitation would be required in many areas and that that would need international assistance , including financial resources and technology transfer to support local and national efforts , the Panel emphasized the need for prevention , rather than mitigation and restoration , wherever practicable , with emphasis on improved and sustainable management of existing natural forest and other vegetation .  
The Panel recognized that in developing countries , domestic resources for financing the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forest are scarce and international financial sources remain vital .  
It reiterated the need for external support through ODA and the provision of new and additional financial resources , and emphasized the need to mobilize new , innovative and additional forms of finance at the public , private , international , domestic and local levels .  
However , while recognizing the important potential in innovative financial packages and new types of public-private partnerships , the Panel emphasized the continuing importance of international public finance and of existing commitments to it , and the need to promote the predictability and continuity of flow of financial resources .  
Efforts in developing countries to secure additional financial resources and technology at domestic level need to be strengthened , and should be supplemented from international sources .  
The Panel agreed that forest-related international , regional and bilateral agencies and organizations , existing legal instruments , financial and trade institutions and treaty bodies should mobilize their respective strengths and capacities in implementing the proposals for action in the Panel 's report , and should further promote policy dialogue , consensus-building and international cooperation , recalling Agenda 21 and paragraph 10 of the Forest Principles .  
The Panel agreed that in order to achieve the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests it is necessary to deal coherently with all the interrelated social , cultural , economic , trade , environment , development , production , financial and technology issues that have a concrete impact on those objectives .  
The extent and shape of the international presence in Haiti following the withdrawal of UNSMIH will necessarily be based on the careful consideration of such factors as the degree of professionalization of the HNP ; the security situation as it relates to the ability of the HNP to carry out its mandate ; the state of the Haitian economy ; the commitment of the Government to promoting national reconciliation ; domestic political support for continued international presence ; and the financial and other constraints facing the United Nations .  
Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
Taking into consideration the modest financial capabilities of the State , in this short period it has been impossible to supply the appropriate equipment and arms for the armed forces of the Republic of Macedonia at a level that would provide for an appropriate initial reaction or a possible urgent military action ;  
Noting with regret the negative effects of the structural adjustment and reform policies conceived and imposed by the international financial organizations and bilateral creditors on the debtor countries to deal with the effects of the foreign debt , on the enjoyment and realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially among the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market access , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of financial resources and better access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Emphasizes the need for new flows of financial resources to the indebted developing countries , and urges the creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase financial assistance on favourable terms as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms , combating poverty , and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Requests the Secretary _ General to submit to the Commission , at its fifty _ fourth session , after high _ level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies , and with intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon on the effective enjoyment of human rights of the people of the developing countries , and in particular of the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ;  
The development of exportable health services is seen as a means of : ( a ) generating the resources required to reduce the financial pressure of the fiscal deficit created by the need to grant universal health care coverage ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ( hospital facilities and other complementary structures ) by utilizing the resources resulting from serving foreign demand ; and ( c ) upgrading technological capacities with a direct impact on the national health system which can be assimilated into and / or adapted to the existing human resources infrastructure .  
In paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 50 / 97 , the Secretary-General is requested to convene another meeting of governmental experts from land-locked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems in the land-locked and transit developing countries with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating specific action-oriented measures [ 1 ] .  
First of all , in the view of ACC members , the report does not take sufficient account of the broad variety of NGOs , whose roles , operational procedures and financial requirements are quite different , ranging from large international organizations to national support NGOs and representative peoples ' organizations .  
With regard to the financial management of resources devoted to NGOs , ACC members agree with the need for a better accounting and reporting procedure , however they are not convinced that the resulting ability to produce comparative statistics will be particularly useful , since the operating budgets of organizations and agencies are very different and their individual needs in terms of cooperation with NGOs are fully adapted to their respective roles and mandates .  
The elements of macroeconomic balance and stability , such as inflation , fiscal deficits and current account deficits ( which reflect the gap between domestic savings and investment ) are widely acknowledged to affect foreign trade and external financial inflows through their effects on interest rates , exchange rates , rates of return on investments and credit ratings , among others .  Sources : ESCAP , 1995 ESCAP Population Data Sheet ( Bangkok , 1995 ) ; United Nations , World Population Prospects : The 1994 Revision ( United Nations publication , Sales No .  
Their economic and social achievements have raised their international credit standing to such a degree that it induces very substantial private investment and financial flows .  
Considering the crucial importance of financial investigations designed to target the wealth of organized crime and thereby deprive it of one of the most important means of its power , the working group agreed that measures could be implemented to detect and monitor the physical transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments at the border , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information thereby obtained and without impeding in any way the freedom of movement of legitimate capital .  
Twelve reports on finance for development ; global financial integration and the strengthening of collaboration between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions , in particular IMF ( two ) ; external debt crisis and development ( two ) ; sustainable development and international economic cooperation : implementation and follow-up to major consensus agreements on development ; financing of development , including net transfer of resources between developed and developing countries ; and overall socio-economic perspective of the world economy ;  
Mr . van Boven was requested to submit , without financial implications , in time for the Sub _ Commission 's consideration at its forty _ eighth session , a revised set of proposed basic principles and guidelines on remedies in the light of existing relevant international instruments , taking into account the new comments received from States and intergovernmental organizations and non _ governmental organizations , as well as the relevant sections of the report of the working group on the administration of justice and the question of compensation .  
In its decision 1996 / 117 , the Sub _ Commission decided to request Mr . Osman El _ Hajj to prepare , without financial implications , an expanded working paper on ways and means of promoting democracy , how democracy can ensure economic , social , cultural and political rights and how to overcome obstacles to democracy , and to present the expanded working paper to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to promote regional economic cooperation by identifying and addressing major development issues and regional concerns and priorities in trade , investment , financial , information technology , industrial and technological areas , and recommend policy options and measures to achieve tangible results and enhance national capacities to meet new challenges .  
To realize the concrete and achievable goals set out by the International Conference on Population and Development , the mobilization of resources , both domestic and external , must be placed high on the global development agenda and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
Recognizing that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential in achieving sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , and that North-South and South-South transfer of environmentally sound technologies is essential for sustainable development , and recognizing also that the fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their sustainable development requirements has not materialized ,  
Also considering that in spite of the commitments made at Rio by the industrialized countries to facilitate transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries and to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , the progress has been very disappointing ,  
Emphasize that trade and environment policies should be mutually supportive in a manner that contributes to sustained economic growth and that positive measures such as financial flows , technical and technological assistance are preferable to trade measures for tackling environmental measures ;  
Strongly urge the developed countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance immediately ;  
In any event , the conditions under which social services are provided must be determined by the State and reflect the rights of citizens , not simply be the result of a private contractual relation between individuals and private firms .  30 .  The State must reclaim the central role in the formulation of public policies , which it sometimes has lost to the private sector and international financial institutions .  
The United Nations should promote regional information-sharing among local and regional governments - e.g . , through regional United Nations workshops and seminars for regional government executives and through the actual involvement of financial managers in the budgetary process and simulation programmes .  Successful cases of programmes in which unregistered entrepreneurs are encouraged to migrate into the small-business sector , should be shared through the United Nations with other developing countries .  
Despite the advances that have been registered in the processes of national reconstruction and development , on which I shall be submitting a separate report to the General Assembly pursuant to the request contained in Assembly resolution 50 / 58 C of 12 December 1995 , the technical and financial assistance of the international community remains necessary .  
Inability on the part of UNOPS to meet administrative costs or to respond to the financial consequences of extraordinary or unanticipated contingencies could result in claimant demands that alternative financing arrangements be placed before the Executive Board , including that responsibility be shared with or assumed by UNDP , the United Nations , or other UNOPS clients .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 9 above , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 87,793,328 dollars gross ( 92,251,479 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1996 ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina until payment is effected .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would indeed have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .

At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti until payment is effected .  
The Committee noted that while the shift in emphasis from the concept man as breadwinner that underpinned current welfare reforms was intended to give women autonomy and reduce humiliating financial dependence , it was concerned that those reforms posed real risks for women who had been homemakers , and not part of the paid workforce , or whose careers had been interrupted by childcare and other responsibilities and for older women who had little earning capacity .  
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
A prominent example is the sensitive investment climate , which had begun to stabilize in 1995 following the adoption of a Law for the Promotion of Investment , the consolidation of the local banking system and related regulatory and institutional developments .

Ferero Ucros to prepare , without financial implications , a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , assessing the utility , scope and structure of a study on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering .  
A further challenge to effective enforcement and regulatory procedures to counter money-laundering is posed by the growth of payment facilities , based on high technology , that enable global financial transactions to be made by coded electronic means .  
The main body of the report shall be comprehensive , informative and analytical in a way that will allow Member States to examine and assess , inter alia , through the debate on the report , the extent to which mandates given by the General Assembly have been fulfilled , as well as to set priorities in the context of the major political , economic and social , administrative and financial issues on its agenda .  
For example , consider the launching of programmes by Governments , United Nations agencies and other international organizations , and major groups , on which consensus was developed by IPF ; consider appropriate mechanisms for the mobilization of institutional , human and financial resources and capacity-building ; and encourage the development of voluntary codes of conduct for the private sector ;  
Consider the feasibility of establishing an international fund to support activities for sustainable forest management ; and explore innovative ways both to use existing financial mechanisms more effectively and to generate new and additional public and private financial resources ;

The international community could contribute to the implementation of the sustainable development programmes required for economic and social progress in the developing countries by providing financial and technical support to those countries and facilitating access to environmentally sound alternative technologies .  
The draft resolution was essentially a procedural document dealing with institutional links between the United Nations and the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the necessary financial support , but listed in its preambular part the main events that had occurred during the year pursuant to the Convention , which was of crucial importance to many developing countries . 
It should be noted that the countries concerned have paid priority attention to certain important dimensions , such as the mission of national steering committees for the process , internal efforts to mobilize financial resources and the intensification of the consultative process based on efforts to achieve a convergence of views with the main bilateral and multilateral partners .  7 .  At the subregional level , all of the competent organizations are now fully engaged in the formulation of subregional action programmes .  
Ukraine invited all States and international organizations , pursuant to resolution 50 / 134 adopted by the General Assembly at its previous session , to provide technical and financial assistance to the scientific and technological research programmes being conducted under the auspices of the International Scientific and Technological Centre recently established in Chernobyl .  
The International Monitoring Committee to supervise the implementation of the Bangui Agreements , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
While it is evident that crime , particularly economic and organized crime in its transnational dimensions , is detrimental to the sustainable development of the African countries , financial cuts in this research area may have negative long-term consequences for the continent as a whole .  
Legacies to future generations are a collective responsibility of todays citizens be this the legacy of natural capital ( the environment ) , physical capital ( infrastructure , plant and equipment ) , financial capital ( savings ) , social capital ( institutions and structures ) and cultural capital ( the values , principles and concepts that are handed down ) . 
The participants noted the need for increased financial and technical assistance from a variety of sources , including export credit institutions , as well as import promotion agencies in the developed countries , for viable projects promoting the exports of developing countries , and encouraged governments and enterprises to make full use of the existing sources of assistance .

The responsibility for preventing involuntary displacement fell to the international community , which must also provide humanitarian and financial assistance to the affected countries , bearing in mind that such measures should be part of a comprehensive strategy to promote peace , security and economic and social development in the countries concerned .  
With regard to the efforts to restructure UNHCR , his delegation supported the measures to increase its efficiency , while stressing that any lasting solution would have to be based on national , regional and international solidarity , which entailed the mobilization of considerable financial and human resources .  
Encourages relevant United Nations funds and programmes and specialized agencies , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to support local , national and international programmes and projects for the Year and also encourages them , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , as well as international financial institutions , to ensure that the concerns and contributions of older persons are integrated into their development programmes ;  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
Given the severe and irreversible health effects of lead poisoning , particularly on children , it is important to accelerate the process of eliminating unsafe uses of lead , including the use of lead in gasoline worldwide , in light of country-specific conditions and with enhanced international support and assistance to developing countries , particularly through the timely provision of technical and financial assistance and the promotion of endogenous capacity-building .  
Consideration should be given to the gradual implementation of pricing policies that are geared towards cost recovery and the equitable and efficient allocation of water , including the promotion of water conservation , in developed countries ; such policies could also be considered in developing countries when they reach an appropriate stage in their development , so as to promote the harmonious management and development of scarce water resources and generate financial resources for investment in new water supply and treatment facilities .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the debt problem , including debt relief in the form of debt rescheduling , debt reduction , debt swaps and , as appropriate , debt cancellation , as well as grants and concessional flows that will help restore creditworthiness .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
The discussions will be videotaped and the taped footage will be utilized to produce a one-hour course on international law which will be distributed , subject to financial constraints , to schools , universities , research institutions , parliamentarians and foreign ministries to promote both knowledge and understanding of international law and international relations .  
At the public sector level , action may include the regional harmonization of taxation ; the regional harmonization of regulation , supervision and financial disclosures , preferably based on international standards ; and monetary and fiscal harmonization .

In Madrid in October 1994 , the Interim Committee of IMF adopted a declaration on a partnership for sustainable global growth , 4 which the Committee updated and broadened at its autumn ( northern hemisphere ) meeting in 1996.5 This set of international guidelines for macroeconomic and financial policy was intended as a framework for policy-making by all IMF members and to guide the Funds policy discussions with members . 
The financial sector , however , continues to be viewed as deserving of special consideration because of its central role in the national economy and the far-reaching damage that financial disruption , caused for instance by imprudent lending or unanticipated changes in prices , can produce in the domestic economy .  
As a result of the increased volume of financial transactions both within and across major national and international payment and settlement systems , there has been concern about the ability of the present institutional arrangements to manage the load , in particular the settlement risk ( i.e . , the risk of the failure of one party to a transaction to complete its obligations in a timely fashion ) .  
As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on sources for the financing of development ( see A / 52 / 399 ) , there has been a shift in the composition of financial flows to developing countries from public to private sector sources , with the latter now accounting for an overwhelming share of the total ( albeit not for all individual countries ) .  This situation is unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future .  
The International Monitoring Committee , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
The relief services programme provides direct material and financial aid to those refugee families without a male adult medically fit to earn an income and without other identifiable means of financial support sufficient to cover food , shelter and other basic needs . 
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , will be undertaken so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-servicing obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their associations and networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions , is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to participate effectively in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes . 
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to the Agenda .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries and monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
The somewhat positive performance by the service sectors is based on growth in the financial sector and , to a lesser extent , in community and personal services , as the preliminary figures for the remaining service sectors show negative movement .  
Within the context of increased financial flows to developing countries and the continuing surge in foreign direct investment , equity and bonds , he noted with optimism the rapid turnaround in private sector financial flows to Mexico and Argentina after the crisis of 1995 and the modest private sector flows to Africa .  
For the developed countries , those responsibilities included a sound global financial system , open trade and investment regimes and consistent and sustained growth in the advanced economies .  
Financial barriers which resulted both from underdeveloped financial infrastructures and from huge external indebtedness prevented developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular from participating actively in the global economy , since such barriers limited their volume of foreign trade and their access to international financial markets .  
In order for developing countries to be able to attract private capital flows , they must maintain good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and close , cooperative working relations with international financial organizations .  
Such comprehensive and balanced reform should be constructed on three pillars , that is , reform in the political area , including the Security Council , reform in the economic area , especially on development , and reform in the financial area , focusing on how truly fair and equitable methods of financing the activities of the Organization are to be realized .  
Further , implementation strategies advocated were not adopted at the country level , the nascent African private sector was not fully prepared to assume the new responsibilities in the industrial investment process and financial support , including term lending , from both domestic and foreign sources was not readily available for industrial projects .  
He welcomed the report of the Secretary-General on the operational framework for the International Year ( A / 52 / 328 ) , paragraph 43 of which stressed that the promotion of active ageing in developing countries needed technical and financial international support .  
The Secretary-General proposed to convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .  
His delegation also endorsed the proposal contained in paragraph 12 of the report that the Department of Economic and Social Affairs should convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .  
He identified the following areas where Yemen required increased technical assistance : general training in trade matters ( under TRAINFORTRADE ) , training to operate ASYCUDA , quality control in the agricultural and food industries , trade information technology , establishment of a financial market , and policy advice and experience in the area of foreign trade and trade negotiations .  
Recognizing that the problem of laundering of money derived from illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , as well as from other serious crimes , has expanded internationally to become such a global threat to the integrity , reliability and stability of financial and trade systems and even government structures as to require countermeasures by the international community as a whole in order to deny safe havens to criminals and their illicit proceeds ,  
Calls upon the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Division of the Secretariat to continue to work , within the framework of their global programme against money-laundering , with relevant multilateral and regional institutions , organizations or bodies engaged in activities against money-laundering and drug trafficking and with international financial institutions to give effect to the above principles by providing training , advice and technical assistance to States upon request and where appropriate .  
Welcomes Commission on Narcotic Drugs resolution 6 ( XL ) of 25 March 1997 concerning the revised budget for the biennium 1996-1997 and the proposed outline for the biennium 1998-1999 of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , and urges all Governments to provide the fullest possible financial and political support to the organization by widening the donor base of the Programme and increasing voluntary contributions , in particular general-purpose contributions , to enable it to continue , expand and strengthen its operational and technical cooperation activities ;  
The needs of the audiovisual library may be included in the annual circular note of the Secretary-General requesting financial assistance for different components of the Programme as one of the items for which States , their institutions or private individuals may wish to make voluntary contributions in monetary terms or in kind ( tapes , equipment , etc . ) .  
The Government of the Republic of Angola has always opposed the economic blockade , and the trade and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America on the Republic of Cuba , in violation of the principles of international law and , on the several occasions when this question was discussed in international forums , particularly at the United Nations , Angola voted in favour of an unconditional lifting of such blockade , on the basis of a frank and constructive dialogue , for the benefit of the people of both countries .  
The already slow process of development in those countries would be further impeded , requiring three types of countermeasures : slowing of population growth , promotion of North-South partnership , such as that envisioned in Agenda 21 and the final documents of other major United Nations conferences , and the eradication of poverty through the creation of an international economic climate favourable to the opening up of markets , debt reduction and increased financial resources flows from North to South .  
Although hampered by financial and administrative constraints , the field operation has successfully accomplished a number of tasks , including compiling information on the human rights situation ; verifying information received , including through investigative missions ; alerting the Special Rapporteur to trends and developments so that she might take timely action ; and organizing the Special Rapporteurs missions .  
This relationship has gained a new momentum , especially in the current international situation , which has witnessed the diversion of a large proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources and has placed a heavy burden on the economies of all nations , particularly the developing countries .  
It was realistic in that it focused on concrete partnerships and practical solutions , and would tap the human , technological and financial resources which had been beyond the reach of the United Nations , and which had become far greater than official development assistance .  
In the light of the current financial situation of the United Nations , the Committee 's attention is drawn to the established practice that all activities related to international conventions or treaties that , under their respective legal instruments , are to be financed outside the regular budget of the United Nations may only be undertaken when sufficient resources to cover the activities in question have been received from the States parties in advance .  
He underscored the importance of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries and said that additional resources were needed in support of such cooperation from the United Nations system , international financial institutions and other public and private sources .  
Although the commercial private sector and non-profit civil society provided a volume of investment and development activities which dwarfed the financial flows channelled through the United Nations , the vast majority of speakers in the plenary meetings of the General Assembly as well as in the Second Committee had reinforced the central role of the United Nations in development cooperation .  
The main needs of developing countries with respect to EMS and ISO 14001 include assistance in awareness building , access to information , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , technical and financial support for participation in the development of international standards , infrastructure requirements including through assistance in the development and implementation of related legislation , the training of local auditors and consultants , sharing experiences on implementing EMS , and support for SMEs .  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
It is noteworthy that the financial resources of the Centres continued to decline in the post-cold-war era despite a broad recognition that the Centres could play a meaningful role in the changed international security environment where regional approaches to disarmament have acquired increasing importance .  
Decisions by substantive legislative bodies requesting new publication ( s ) , subsequent to those approved in the programme budget , should be taken only after the careful review of , among other things , information on the potential for duplication and financial implications , and a time-frame should be incorporated .  
Calls upon the relevant international financial institutions to give favourable consideration to regional developmental plans , including projects and programmes of the Economic Cooperation Organization , in order to extend their assistance in the implementation of these programmes and , in particular , to the establishment of a comprehensive transport and communications infrastructure in the region of the Economic Cooperation Organization that would provide the landlocked countries with greater mobility to promote interregional trade and to establish mutually beneficial economic and commercial interaction with other regions ;  
Invites the relevant international financial institutions to give appropriate consideration to regional developmental plans , including projects and programmes of the Economic Cooperation Organization , in order to extend their assistance in the implementation of these programmes and , in particular , to the establishment of a comprehensive transport and communications infrastructure in the region of the Economic Cooperation Organization that would provide the landlocked countries with greater mobility to promote interregional trade and to establish mutually beneficial economic and commercial interaction with other regions ;  
Among the cross-cutting development constraints hampering the private sector were an ineffective or shallow financial sector ; lack of a legal and regulatory system ; weak infrastructure ; obsolete technology , poor on - and off-farm storage facilities , high taxation , and generally inadequate support services ; an inadequate policy framework ; an inefficient and overly dominant public enterprise sector ; misdirected development assistance ; high transaction costs ; and lack of trust in the interaction between the Government and the private sector .  
The Commission concludes that Governments and other organizations should work together with UNCTAD to create an enabling environment for micro finance institutions ( MFIs ) and that to work with MFIs in mobilizing funds from sources such as the international financial market is timely and important .  * As agreed at the Commissions third ( closing ) plenary meeting on 5 December 1997 .  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Noting that the globalization of financial markets can generate new risks of instability , including interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations , which have the potential to aggravate the volatility of short-term capital flows and to adversely affect the international financial system , requiring all countries to pursue sound economic policies and to recognize the external economic impact of their domestic policies ,  
Recognizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries and monetary and financial authorities and institutions so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Also recognizes the importance of ensuring transparency and accountability at the national level to achieve policy credibility and confidence-building as well as sound regulatory and supervisory arrangements so as to strengthen the domestic financial system , and further recognizes the importance of a stable international economic environment and stability in the international monetary system ;  
Stresses the need for strengthened international cooperation through strengthened regional and multilateral cooperation to prevent future currency crises , which negatively affect not only developing countries but also the international financial and monetary system ;  
Recognizes the benefit of exchange rate stability and a stable financial environment , and the potential impact on all countries of lack of stability in the foreign exchange markets , and in that regard invites the International Monetary Fund to fully exercise its mandate to sustain effective surveillance over the underlying macroeconomic policies of its member countries , in particular those countries whose economies are particularly relevant for the stability of the international monetary and financial system ;  
Also recognizes that an effective International Monetary Fund surveillance mechanism requires , among other elements , the regular and timely provision of reliable economic and financial data from all Fund members , and in that regard invites the Fund , within its mandate , to explore how data can be gathered from other relevant sources in order to contribute to the effectiveness of its surveillance mechanism ;  
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene in 1999 , within the overall level of resources for the biennium 1998-1999 , another meeting of governmental experts from landlocked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems , including sectoral aspects , as well as transit transportation costs , with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating necessary action-oriented measures ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , international financial organizations and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;  
Emphasizes the importance of supporting and strengthening the new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities laid down in the new sustainable development programme for the region ;  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of the region ;  
Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti has begun to implement a structural adjustment programme , and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences , in particular the social consequences , of the adjustment policy being implemented , so that the country may achieve lasting economic results ,  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic , financial , political , social and legal environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
The financial situation of the Agency was becoming more disturbing with every year that passed , and in that connection the European Union called on the international community to provide maximum political and financial support to the Agency and to give it sufficient resources to enable it to carry out its tasks until a just , lasting and comprehensive solution had been found to the political problems which had led to the appearance of Palestinian refugees in the Middle East . 
The system of financial assistance for returnees had set the stage for these changes as early as 1982 , but it was not until 1986 with the introduction of strict controls on foreigners ' entry and stay in France and widespread identity checks , that all immigrant groups were designated as potentially responsible for everything wrong with French society , an attitude which encouraged a particularly disturbing racist and xenophobic movement in France , especially at the electoral level . 
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;  
A wide range of applications were planned through those services , including distance learning , corporate training , collaborative work-groups , telecommuting , telemedicine , wireless backbone interconnection ( that is , wireless Local Area Network-Wide Area Network ) , video distribution , DTH video and satellite newsgathering , as well as the distribution of software , music , scientific data and global financial and weather information .  
Treaty bodies were encouraged to appoint individual members to liaise with specialized agencies or other intergovernmental bodies of most relevance to their respective mandate and to invite representatives of international financial institutions and other international and multilateral and development institutions to present to them an analysis of the impact of their activities on women 's enjoyment of economic and social rights in the light of international standards in general , and in relation to particular States .  
In addition , information is provided on the serious problems facing the Cuban economy resulting from the severance of economic relations with the former Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe , which were Cuba 's main trading partners ; the effects of the almost 40-year economic , commercial and financial blockade of Cuba ; problems affecting its principal exports , especially cane sugar ; and natural disasters , including hurricanes and tropical storms and infestation by a new agricultural pest .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
The main body of the report shall be comprehensive , informative and analytical in a way that will allow Member States to examine and assess , inter alia , through its debate the extent to which mandates given by the General Assembly have been fulfilled , as well as for priority setting by Member States in the context of major political , economic and social , administrative and financial issues on its agenda .  
First , there is a need to evolve a genuine partnership which recognizes the inequality and disadvantaged situation of the developing countries in the global economy and thus an imperative for the developed countries to have the much-needed political will to support the development efforts of developing countries through the provision of concessional financial flows , preferential treatment in market access , durable debt-relief measures , favourable terms in the transfer of technology and support for South-South cooperation .  
It also reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development .  
To respond to those urgent humanitarian needs , the Government , lacking other resources , had to redeploy , on an emergency basis , a major part of the State budget and financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes .  
In addition to that proposal , various other topics were mentioned with respect to which it might be worthwhile to explore the desirability and feasibility of work at the international level ; those were : legislative treatment of cross-border insolvency in the banking and financial services sector , preparation of model agreements or practices for cross-border cooperation in reorganizations of insolvent enterprises , conflict-of-laws solutions in cross-border insolvency cases , and the effects of insolvency proceedings on arbitration agreements and arbitral proceedings .  
Many countries ( which have suffered and continue to suffer great material and financial damage as a result of sanctions ) are therefore completely justified in their desire to elaborate basic criteria and conditions for the application and implementation of mandatory sanctions , and develop ways and means of preventing the adverse consequences of such sanctions or , at least , reducing them to a minimum .  
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
One critical constraint had been the lack of adequate financial resources , both from national budgets and from traditional sources of development assistance to support TCDC activities and another was the ineffective functioning of TCDC national focal points .  
The constant state of financial difficulties , a very lengthy period of transition and the crippling effect of serious time constraints on all participants in the legislative process has led to a situation where budgetary approval comes about not as the result of an orderly process but rather as an achievement arrived at in an ad hoc manner often in the absence of sufficient data , analysis and justification .  
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .  
On the contrary , they have become even more marginalized in the global economy for the very simple reason that they lack the physical , financial and human resources as well as the institutional infrastructure necessary for effective competition and integration in the international markets .  
In the current post-transition phase , the results achieved in the democratic processes and economic reform , which have been recognized by the international community and financial institutions , qualify Romania legitimately to play a clearer and more active role in defining and designing common projects of security and progress in the region and in the world , including within the United Nations and its specialized agencies .  
Our debates will have to take into account the recent trends in world economy such as high rates of growth , far exceeding those of gross world product achieved by world trade ; transportation ; and the volume of direct investment and international financial transactions and the necessity of ensuring a wider access of goods produced in developing countries to the developed countries ' markets and enhanced cooperation on third markets .  
There can be no universal environmental preservation without a genuine change in the unsustainable consumption patterns that bring about the increasing deterioration of the global environment , without adequate financial assistance for development in percentages proportional to gross domestic product , and without adequate facilities to access modern technologies .  
Over the last six months , we have used this peace-building fund for the following purposes : to provide critical start-up funding for the historical clarification Commission in Guatemala ; to assist the preparatory commission for the establishment of an international criminal court by underwriting the participation of delegates from developing countries ; and to provide financial assistance for the work of the joint United Nations / Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) Special Representative for the Great Lakes region of Africa , Mr . Mohamed Sahnoun .  
It highlights the continuation of the basically adverse nature of an international economic environment characterized by the North 's increasing monopoly of the decisive elements of development : trade , financial and stock markets , flows of capital and investment , and technology transfer .  
Like other members , I noted with particular interest that President Clinton first at the Waldorf Astoria hotel on the evening of 21 September , then the following day in this Hall forcefully and germanely stressed the need for the United Nations to ensure that the globalization of the economy does not create deep disparities between rich and poor and that it establishes innovative partnerships between the private sector , non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
While , to be sure , it is first and foremost up to the African countries to make the greater part of the effort , the excessively restrictive procedures and conditionalities for the granting of loans , and the lukewarm reaction of certain creditors to the idea of simply cancelling the foreign debt of poor countries , are obstacles to the effective mobilization of the expected financial resources .  
Today the developed countries have the moral duty to be as concerned as Africans themselves about the destiny of Africa , not to abandon Africa along the roadside of globalization and to make available to it part of their enormous material , technological and financial strength , in order to support Africa 's efforts in the struggle to emerge from underdevelopment and to enter the modern age .  
In this regard , our objectives are to correct the economic , financial and structural imbalances ; to achieve steadiness and stability in the economy as a whole ; to activate the role of the private sector in the competitive free-market economy ; to achieve sustainable development ; to foster stable environments so as to attract foreign investments ; to upgrade the basic necessary services of society ; and to build the new State and improve the standards of living of all citizens .  
This leads me to say that a country such as Yemen , which mainly depends on foreign aid to carry out its internal policy that is , its economic , social and cultural development has to take into account , in seeking the financial and technical assistance needed to achieve the objectives of the internal policy , certain basic considerations that might seem to others supplementary and not mandatory .  
We are convinced that at a time when the question of more rational use of United Nations resources , including financial resources , has become a priority , the Secretary-General 's decision to focus on the activities that the United Nations can best carry out , from the standpoint both of using existing intellectual potential and of meeting the requirements of a large group of members of the international community , is very wise .  
Within the context of an increasingly integrated and complex global economic system of production and distribution , trade liberalization and globalization of financial markets , the major thrust of the development strategy of the Government of the Republic of Suriname lies in the revitalization and strengthening of production and export capacity as the main engines of growth while maintaining financial and monetary stability .  
For meaningful development to take root in the developing countries , an enabling international environment should be established which can address such issues as macroeconomic stability , more open trade regimes in developed countries , stable financial systems , reasonable debt initiatives , such as those proposed under the World Bank 's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and greater financial flows from developed countries to the developing countries .  
And we seek the active partnership of the multilateral institutions as well as of the international community , through joint ventures , technological transfers and financial and technical assistance to provide the impetus to sustained economic growth .  
Information provided both by the Secretariat and by specialized agencies gives an objective quantitative picture of where the phenomena of poverty , unemployment and social disintegration are most acute : the same places experiencing an increased deterioration in the terms of trade ; protectionism ; a fall in the prices of exported raw materials ; and the drying up of financial flows .  
In this spirit , the United Nations must look for the best ways and means to make its activities in the area of social development more effective , including by strengthening coordination between economic and social activities and improving coordination with international financial institutions , since only through concrete and pragmatic programmes can our Organization get more out of the aid and assistance it provides to States for the establishment of social policies .  
Algeria is keen to preserve what it has achieved , in spite of economic difficulties due to financial constraints and the requirements of economic and institutional restructuring , which are designed firmly to put Algerian society on the path to progress and modernity through the creation of a more efficient market economy and the establishment of a pluralistic democratic society .  
The international economic system must be overhauled to enhance the trade prospects of the poor countries and to facilitate their access to science and technology , technical assistance and increased financial flows , both private and official .  
All national development efforts need a vision a focal point to make coordinated and sustained improvements supported by political will , the participation of the people and solid organizational and financial backing .  
Without a supportive external economic environment that includes cooperation in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies , trade liberalization , mobilization of new and additional financial resources , financial stability , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , and productive investment in technologies , our efforts would be akin to trying to roll uphill .  
An essential element in propagating a culture of peace is to refrain from implementing policies that would widen the gulf between the rich developed countries and poor third world countries , unable to ensure growth , to make the best use of their natural and human resources , with the resultant unemployment , financial deficit and indebtedness worsening year after year .  
For the East Asian region , which has been subjected to extreme volatility of currency and stock markets , the urgent need for critical regulatory safeguards in respect of international financial markets is unambiguous .  
The resolution calls for a report that is more easily directed to assessing the way in which mandates of the General Assembly have been fulfilled over the past year and setting priorities for the period ahead in the major political , economic and social , administrative and financial areas .  
The increasing necessity and demand for activities in the field of peacekeeping and related areas , and the simultaneous political and financial problems connected with these United Nations activities , have made it clear at an early stage that the involvement of regional organizations in this area has to be enhanced , for their mutual benefit .  
Similarly , it is recognized that implementation of the Summit 's Declaration and Programme of Action will require the mobilization of financial resources at the national and international levels and that the specific cases of Africa and the least developed countries will need additional resources and more effective development cooperation and assistance .  
However , we believe it is fitting to express our thanks for the support and cooperation of the United Nations , the friendly countries that directly supported the peace processes in Guatemala , Nicaragua and El Salvador , and the cooperating community , whose technical and financial assistance complemented the political and diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region .  
It is precisely because of our recognition of the specific and peculiar problems faced by the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories most of which are small island Territories that suffer from impediments created by the interplay of such factors as economic and geographic size , isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters and lack of technological and financial resources , including problems of accessibility to international credit markets that the international community should give specific priority and attention to the process of decolonization affecting the peoples of those Territories . 
Thailand also strongly feels that it is only just and logical that those who manufacture , export and earn profits from landmines should have special responsibility in bearing at least a major portion of the costs of financial and technical aid to mine-affected countries , rehabilitation programmes for the stricken societies and communities and humanitarian assistance to the victims and to mine survivors themselves and their families .  
On the one hand and thanks to the praiseworthy support of the Organization of African Unity , the League of Arab States , the French Republic and the assistance of the international community its goal was to lay the foundations for the reconstruction of a country that has for so long been buffeted by numerous acts of external aggression that have engendered enormous economic and financial difficulties that have significantly hampered its development . 
If any attempt were made to make a list of such elements , however , it would have to include many others that affect international peace and security and relations of respect and cooperation between States , such as the implementation of unilateral measures of political , economic and financial coercion and the arbitrary and indefinite imposition of Security Council sanctions that do not take humanitarian limitations into account .  
Since our Secretary-General presented his proposals for reform in July , the Central American countries have expressed firm support for his ideas about a modern , efficient , nimble Organization with better coordination in line with current administrative and financial trends , an Organization enabling us , without further delay , to move from lofty aspirations to real actions that will help everybody , especially those in developing countries , which comprise the overwhelming majority of the members of this body .  
That process was expected to result in the preparation of a comprehensive and balanced document to address both security and humanitarian aspects of the problem , and to make provisions for financial support and the transfer of relevant advanced technology to affected countries , enabling those States to overcome this serious problem .  
We believe that measures aimed at curbing mines should be accompanied by serious and concrete steps geared towards mine clearance in affected countries that are unable to achieve that objective on their own , by providing technical and financial support and through the transfer of necessary advanced technology to enable these States to overcome this tragic legacy . 
In the view of Argentina , before deciding to convene the special session , and after having carefully studied its financial implications , it would be advisable to ensure the proper preparation of the session and provide it with some real content so that we do not repeat past mistakes .  
The mutual recognition of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1993 , the signing of the Declaration of Principles and the subsequent withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and some areas of the West Bank , as well as the establishment of an elected Palestinian Authority , were historic milestones along the road to peace that the international community encouraged and nurtured with political and financial support .  
This session is confronted with the onerous task not only of pointing to the imbalances that have emerged since Rio between the advances in political and economic reforms achieved in the third world and the clearly diminishing resources to fund sustainable development , but also of securing a renewed commitment , with firm assurances , to stronger financial aid .  
Although the world community set out on the right path with the adoption of Agenda 21 in Rio , and although steps are being taken on the national and international levels towards achieving our goals , globalization , economic and social disparities , pressing agricultural and industrial needs , serious financial constraints and technological deficiencies all combine to make sustainable development an elusive target .  
Most developing countries , however , and particularly the least developed countries have not been able to expand their trade , to become integrated into world financial markets , or to attract much foreign investment , due primarily to lack of human resource development , infrastructure , political and economic stability , or networking .  
For most developing countries , continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet the needs for investment capital , foreign exchange , and human development priorities .  
In addition to national systems of financial regulation , international standards are also needed to promote sound financial principles and practices and avoid destructive competition and inconsistency between countries .  Such international standards should be developed through the existing international bodies that coordinate financial regulation and supervision .  
The trend to policy convergence towards the open-economy model derives in part from the demonstrated or perceived successes of that model ; it is also driven by global market actors , in particular developed country Governments and international financial and trade institutions that make such policies a condition for access to resources . 
In the face of the tendency of global financial markets and international financial institutions to demand fiscal and monetary austerity , especially of the weaker economies , constraining both national and international economic growth , there is a need to develop new national and international policy instruments to promote growth and employment while maintaining macroeconomic stability . 
Volatile financial flows not only pose threats to the solvency of national financial institutions , whether public or private but also have the potential to destabilize the international financial system , given the increasingly integrated nature of world capital markets .  
Reduction of poverty requires not just providing goods and services to people living in poverty but also improving opportunities for access to productive resources and capital accumulation , including human capital ( education , health ) , financial capital ( microcredit ) , physical capital ( appropriate technology ) and natural resources ( land , water , energy ) .  
Continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet those needs , to support structural adjustment , and to enable the least developed countries and other low-income countries to benefit from globalization and to generate sustained growth .  
Developed countries should continue to reorient their ODA in favour of the least developed countries , whose trade and investment opportunities are otherwise limited , and in favour of those new social-sector targets agreed upon by the OECD Development Assistance Committee ( DAC ) at its ministerial meeting in May 1996.1 Furthermore , given the rapid emergence of advanced developing countries in Asia and Latin America as new donors , South / South cooperation could be encouraged with financial assistance from developed countries . 
While national systems of regulation and control are essential prerequisites for financial stability and sustained capital flows , international standards are needed to promote sound principles and practices and to avoid competition and inconsistency between countries .  
The attention of the Commission is also drawn to Economic and Social Council decision 1996 / 295 of 24 July 1996 , by which the Council , taking note of Commission on Human Rights decision 1996 / 111 of 23 April 1996 , decided to authorize , if possible within existing financial resources , 40 fully serviced additional meetings , including summary records , in accordance with rules 29 and 31 of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , for the Commission 's fifty _ third session .  
In accordance with the resolution and arrangements : voluntary contributions paid to the Fund are distributed , through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals who have been tortured and to their relatives ; the Fund is administered by the Secretary-General with the advice of a board of trustees authorized to promote and solicit contributions and pledges ; and an annual report is submitted by the Secretary-General to the Assembly and , as appropriate , to the Commission on Human Rights .  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter , in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
Reaffirms the importance of ensuring the uniform and consistent application of the Convention and a coordinated approach to its overall implementation , and of strengthening technical cooperation and financial assistance for this purpose , stresses once again the continuing importance of the efforts of the Secretary-General to these ends , and reiterates its invitation to the competent international organizations and other international bodies to support these objectives ;  
Clearing arrears and establishing a sustainable debt-servicing position create an opportunity which , combined with structural adjustment and official financial support , can promote foreign and private investment and , thus , economic growth .  
Two points should be made clear : ( a ) at a time when the Human Rights Operation in Rwanda was advising staff not to travel on Cameroon Airlines aircraft and to be careful in their choice of airlines , the Special Rapporteur was forced to travel by Cameroon Airlines ; this is particularly regrettable in that experts and special rapporteurs have no insurance coverage ; ( b ) the Special Rapporteur 's budget of $ 69,770 for the current financial year had not yet been touched , although the year was drawing to a close . 
The Conference of the Parties decided that the restructured GEF should continue , on an interim basis , to serve as the institutional structure on an interim basis , and in its decisions II / 6 and II / 7 instructed GEF to facilitate urgent implementation of articles 6 and 8 of the Convention by making available to developing country Parties financial resources for projects in a flexible and expeditious manner .  
Countries are still a long way from attaining the objective of providing incentive measures to enhance local benefits from biodiversity , including establishing secure property or use rights ; providing education and relevant technologies ; providing compensation for damage to crops , livestock and other property damaged by wild animals / predators ; involving local communities in biodiversity management ; and providing endowment funds or other financial mechanisms that ensure predictable and secure sources of income , such as user fees , franchises , land-use taxes and bonds .  
Cooperation and corporate responsibility of the private sector in acknowledging and addressing public concerns over unintended consequences of technological applications , including biotechnology , are essential for the success of economic and financial policies of Governments , including the implementation of transparent EIAs on proposed projects .  * The report was prepared by the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , as task manger for chapter 15 of Agenda 21 , in accordance with arrangements agreed to by the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development ( IACSD ) .  
Constraints include : ( a ) scarcity of human and financial resources ; ( b ) low institutional capacity ; ( c ) lack of coherent realistic policies in some countries , and on occasions lack of political will ; and ( d ) inadequate awareness and understanding of the potential benefits and risks of the technology , as well as of the requirements for its environmentally sound management .  
As noted above , while there has been a rapid development of land-related information systems in those economies having access to adequate financial and technological resources , information systems in many developing countries have been severely limited by the non-availability of basic natural resource data and information , by undeveloped market infrastructure , and by a lack of institutional capability .  
The need for improved access to funding is recognized by the innovative proposal to establish a global mechanism to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms and to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial financial resources to affected developing country Parties to the Convention .  
Since rural energy problems persist and energy is not playing its full role as a motor for rural development , the following issues have emerged as complementary priorities or as new areas of focus : ( a ) more emphasis on the micro or household level ; ( b ) renewed interest in eco-village projects , solar villages etc . ; ( c ) promotion of innovative financial schemes to promote small businesses ; and ( d ) emphasis on the impact of rural energy on agricultural productivity .  
At the international level , some promising progress has been achieved by joint implementation programmes , international environmental funds and national environmental funds , which have started attracting external financial resources .  
The main objectives of chapter 33 of Agenda 21 are ( a ) to establish measures concerning financial resources and mechanisms for the implementation of Agenda 21 ; ( b ) to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable ; and ( c ) to seek the full use and continuing qualitative improvement of funding mechanisms to be utilized for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Given the current scarcity of public resources , additional funds need to be mobilized through increased use of economic instruments ( general tax reforms , eco-taxes , subsidy reduction and tradeable permit schemes ) , increased private-sector involvement , national environmental funds and innovative international financial mechanisms .  
There are some successful models for international financial mechanisms , such as joint implementation programmes ( e.g . , the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly ( AIJ ) established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its first meeting and international environmental funds ( e.g . , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and the Montreal Protocol Environmental Fund ( MPEF ) ) which have transferred developed country resources to developing countries for investments in sustainable development related to the protection of the global environment . 
Egypt is aware of the magnitude and severity of the problems related to the proliferation of anti _ personnel landmines , which is above all a humanitarian issue given the suffering they inflict on civilian populations , the heavy financial burden and the limited nature of the technology used in the detection and deactivation of these mines . 
While legal and institutional instruments have definitely improved the basis for sustainable development of oceans and coastal areas , implementation lags behind owing , among other things , to ( a ) the difficulty in making political decisions regarding resources and wealth allocation ; ( b ) the difficulty of improving inadequate or inefficient institutions ; and ( c ) in many cases , difficulties in meeting the related financial commitments .  
Urges Member States carefully to consider the problems posed by the international aspects of corrupt practices , especially as regards international economic activities carried out by corporate entities , and to study appropriate legislative and regulatory measures to ensure the transparency and integrity of financial systems and transactions carried out by such corporate entities ;  
Decides that the preparatory process for the special session of the General Assembly should be funded through the regular budget of the United Nations , bearing in mind the need to keep financial costs to a minimum , and that Governments should be invited to make extrabudgetary contributions to meet those costs ;  
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
Noting the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
Considering , in particular , that in order to respond to those urgent humanitarian needs the Government of the Comoros , in the absence of other resources , had to reallocate as a matter of great urgency the major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State and the financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes ,  
Acknowledges the interest in holding the next informal round table in the Latin American and Caribbean region , to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa , and invites interested States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the convening of these informal round tables on communication for development , with the participation of the international financial institutions and the regional banks , at the country level ;  
By its decision 51 / 406 of 17 October 1996 , the General Assembly decided that , for Member States that had fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of $ 1,970,718 gross ( $ 1,718,168 net ) for the period from 16 May 1995 to 12 January 1996 should be set off against future assessments .  
Fund-raising and promotional efforts directed towards increasing funding opportunities resulted in several project-specific donations and , thanks to the continuous support of Italy , the host country , the overall financial situation of UNICRI stabilized at a somewhat more viable level , although demands for assistance and services are still greater than the capacity of UNICRI to provide timely and adequate responses to them . 
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
Calls upon Governments to invite and encourage the active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , local community groups and the media , as well as financial and non-profit organizations for the implementation of the Platform for Action ;  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Emphasizing the importance of cooperation and international solidarity in supporting the efforts being made by the peoples and Governments of Central America for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace , and the need to strengthen the new programme of cooperation and economic , technical and financial assistance for Central America in the light of the new situation in the region ,  
Supports the treatment accorded to Nicaragua in the light of its continuing exceptional circumstances , so that the international community and financial institutions can incorporate that treatment into programmes to support the country 's economic recovery and social reconstruction ;  
The emphasis by the CSD " that for all developing countries to benefit more fully from trade liberalization , the achievement of other objectives identified in Agenda 21 , particularly better functioning of commodity markets , increasing foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in developing countries and financial assistance , including debt relief , are important " 6 continues to be relevant to policy efforts .  
Policy-makers have therefore increasingly focused on positive measures largely based on market mechanisms and financial incentives to capture the numerous external benefits provided by biologically diverse ecosystems . 63 These mechanisms include debt-for-nature swaps , transferable development rights , green taxes on eco-tourist activities , watershed protection payments , and managed harvest rights in protected areas . 
Mexico noted that there was a lack of clarity in the idea put forward in the Working Group that " in exceptional cases , when the Committee deemed that there was no other reasonable way to lodge a communication , some other means could be accepted , such as oral presentation , or taped submissions " . 6 On that point , the view was taken that consideration should be given to the practical difficulties that an oral presentation would give rise to , including significant financial implications . 
Close to 40 formal case-studies were commissioned and three very successful international workshops were held , with financial support mobilized from a wide variety of sources : a regional workshop for Africa ( Dakar , June 1995 ) ; an international workshop for Asia and other regions ( Madras , February 1996 ) ; and a global meeting during the Habitat II .  
The objective will be to develop an integrated and multidimensional strategy for the implementation , coordination and promotion of the right to development in accordance with the Declaration on the Right to Development and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , aimed at facilitating action to be taken by relevant bodies of the United Nations system , including human rights treaty bodies , and international development and financial institutions and non _ governmental organizations . 
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
The Government of Iraq resorted to the imposition of a tax on travel as a purely administrative and financial measure that was not intended to impede travel by citizens or discriminate between them on political or social grounds ; it was necessitated by the situation brought about by the iniquitous economic embargo imposed on Iraq .  
The assessment team meets with interested parties , both governmental and non-governmental , in close cooperation with the United Nations Resident Coordinator , United Nations agencies and programmes , as well as local donors , and compiles detailed information on current policies , legislation , and human and financial capacities in key areas .  
All the while , a core of supporting multilateral agencies , despite severe financial constraints , have provided some of the required support and sought together , in a pragmatic manner , to identify their comparative advantages in responding to the countries ' perceived needs and in identifying the respective areas of complementarity .  
UNDP has played a key role in the development of a common understanding of the programme approach which is now contained in the Operational Activities Reference Manual published in 1996 by the Consultative Committee on Programme and Operational Questions ( CCPOQ ) with significant substantive and financial support from UNDP . 
As indicated in the report on follow-up to the decisions taken by the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 1996 , CCPOQ , with considerable substantive and financial assistance from UNDP , published an operational activities reference manual , which has now been forwarded to all country offices and will serve as a unifying framework within which each agency will operate using its own detailed operational procedures .  
Thus , it should support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development .  
Encourages relevant United Nations funds and programmes and the specialized agencies , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to support local , national , and international programmes and projects for the Year , and also encourages them , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , as well as the international financial institutions , to ensure that the concerns and contributions of older persons are integrated into their development programmes ;  
There is need for a coherent set of legislative measures with programmes to achieve strengthening of the small business [ and informal ] sector through the development of appropriate legal , management and financial structures , to enable the sector to develop in a sustained and organized way ; and to initiate and strengthen financing mechanism that enhance small business [ and informal ] sector access to financial services and to reduce the cost of providing and acquiring these services .  
The Committee will consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , informational and financial matters .  
The Vienna Programme of Action [ 5 ] adopted by the Conference addressed three major areas : ( i ) strengthening the science and technology capacities of the developing countries ; ( ii ) restructuring the existing pattern of international scientific and technological relations in the transfer of technology ; and ( iii ) strengthening the role of the United Nations system in promoting new ways of technology cooperation as well as considerably increasing the provision of financial resources for such purposes .  
Constraints to external communication and public affairs identified through the change management exercise were : ( a ) unclear policy messages in written and oral communications , which are frequently jargon-ridden and lacking in hard facts ; ( b ) uneven collaboration between DPA and line units ; ( c ) a media-shy culture in UNDP as a whole ; and ( d ) insufficient financial investment in communication .  
While gratis personnel had played a valuable role in advancing the implementation of approved activities , particularly in the current climate of budgetary constraint , his delegation concurred with the Advisory Committee 's view that gratis personnel should not be sought solely for financial reasons but should be recruited to enhance the efficiency of the United Nations by bringing experts with needed skills and experience into the organizational fold .  
Pointing to the danger that the High-level Working Group could take decisions which were actually contrary to those adopted by the General Assembly , she proposed that all administrative and budgetary questions currently addressed by the High-level Working Group , including the review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations and human resources management , should be considered by the Fifth Committee during the resumed fifty-first session .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the highly indebted poorest countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , comprehensive , durable and development-oriented solutions , including such measures as debt reduction , debt swaps , debt cancellation , and increased grants and concessional flows . 
Policies for promoting domestic resources mobilization should include macroeconomic and structural reforms , public expenditure reforms , the promotion of environmental taxes and charges , a review of existing subsidy policies , and financial sector development to promote personal saving and access to credit , taking into account the characteristics and capabilities of individual countries .  
Secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity and human resources , and adequate access to technology may promote the implementation of international legal instruments .  
It is important for Governments , financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , civil society , women 's organizations and other relevant actors to promote women 's entrepreneurial and self-employed activities through technical assistance services or programmes ; information on markets ; training ; the creation of networks , including those at the regional and international levels ; and adequate financial support ; and where appropriate , by developing incentives .  
Everyone has the right [ is entitled ] , individually and in association with others , to solicit , receive and utilize voluntary financial or other contributions , for the purpose of promoting and protecting , through peaceful means , [ universally recognized ] human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to issue specific administrative instructions to establish clearly the responsibility and accountability of programme managers for proper use of human resources , as well as sanctions in accordance with staff rule 112.3 for any financial loss suffered by the United Nations as a result of gross negligence , including improper motivation , wilful violation or reckless disregard of the Staff Regulations and Rules and established policies regulating recruitment , placement and promotion ;  
In contrast , the principle was recognized long ago in the environmental area in which many of the arrangements made in relation to key treaties provide for financial and other forms of assistance to help States to undertake the necessary monitoring , to prepare reports and to implement some of the measures required in order to ensure compliance with treaty obligations .  26 .  Thus the principal question in the present context is what measures might be taken in order to facilitate achievement of the oft-confirmed goal of universal ratification of the six core treaties ?  
It has been suggested in a number of places in this report that the provision of advisory services , or technical cooperation in the field of human rights , has a vital role to play in relation to those States which do not have the administrative capacity , technical expertise or financial resources required to prepare the reports they are legally obligated to provide under the relevant treaties .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to issue specific administrative instructions to establish clearly the responsibility and accountability of programme managers for proper use of human resources , as well as sanctions in accordance with staff rule 112.3 for any financial loss suffered by the United Nations as a result of gross negligence , including improper motivation , wilful violation or reckless disregard of the Staff Regulations and Rules and established policies regulating recruitment , placement and promotion ;  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
The international community will in future have to supply technological , economic and financial assistance to support political stability and balanced development , democratic institution-building and respect for human rights .  
Stressing the link between peace and development , noting that significant international assistance is indispensable for sustainable development in Haiti , and stressing that a sustained commitment by the international community and the international financial institutions to assist and support the economic , social and institutional development in Haiti is indispensable for long-term peace and security in the country ,  
Invites States , intergovernmental organizations and all those participating in the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction to provide technical and financial assistance , including national capacity-building , to developing countries to support global and regional observation systems and research , including the dissemination of data on El Ni �� , to prevent , mitigate and redress the negative effects of the phenomenon ;  
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene in 1999 within the overall level of resources for the biennium 1998-1999 , another meeting of governmental experts from landlocked and transit developing countries , and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems , including sectoral aspects , as well as transit transportation costs , with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating necessary action-oriented measures ;  
Calls upon both the bilateral and multilateral donor communities to mobilize adequate financial resources to supplement efforts by small island developing States , at both the national and regional levels , in the implementation of the programmes referred to in operative paragraph 5 above , including support to existing regional and subregional institutions ;  
However , the functioning of local government remains incomplete in important financial and legal areas : most municipalities can not provide basic communal services because they have not received sufficient funds ; only half of them have finalized plans for economic reconstruction ; and the boundaries of the new municipalities drawn before the April elections have not been legally recognized , creating doubts as to their existence after the end of UNTAES .  
The pace of future movements is inhibited by three main factors : legal and financial obstacles to the recovery of property ; unrealistic government deadlines for Serb applications for reconstruction assistance and delays in government funding for reconstruction of Serb houses ; and the uncertain economic and social situation in areas of potential return .  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in support of national efforts in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Emphasizes that , in developing countries , rural development remains central to poverty eradication efforts , and this often includes agrarian reform , investment in infrastructure , extension of rural financial intermediation ensuring food security , better education and greater utilization of appropriate technology , ensuring fair prices to provide incentives for agricultural investment , and increasing productivity , including productivity in the informal sector ;  
Invites the international community , including multilateral financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives taken regarding debt relief for developing countries , including Naples terms and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ' Debt Initiative , and to continue their efforts in this field with a view to contributing to a durable solution to the debt problems of developing countries , and encourages donors to ensure adequate financing of these mechanisms and / or initiatives , particularly in African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to eradicate poverty ;  
In the interests of equity , binding commitments for non-Annex I Parties could not even be envisaged until agreement had been reached on a fair system of apportionment of emission limits , a globally agreed reduction pathway and a projected sustainable future emission level on an equitable basis , and until there was reliable and predictable financial provision for the acquisition and adaptation of sound technologies , know-how and production systems in developing countries .  
Such a strategy should be based on three principles : developed countries should take the lead now in committing themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 level ; developing countries should also take actions to address climate change problems in promoting their sustainable development , taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities under the Convention and their respective capabilities ; and developed countries should strengthen their partnership with developing countries through the provision of financial and technological support for mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions .  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , the international financial organizations , and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
Noting further that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
In the event , a persistent failure to implement a coherent programme of structural reform finally came to a head in Bulgaria in the spring of 1996 with a massive financial and economic crisis which has still to be resolved ; instead of growing by a forecast 3 per cent , Bulgarian GDP actually fell by 10 per cent . 
A recent study1 has stressed that a current account deficit of more than 5 per cent is likely to become a problem only when a range of conditions apply : when the export sector is small , debt service is large , domestic savings are low , and the financial sector is weak and dominated by banks subject to weak regulation .  
It also needs to be emphasized that , unlike the western European countries in the late 1940s and 1950s which benefited from Marshall aid and other official support for financing their current account deficits over a number of years and thus sustaining growth and reconstruction , the transition economies are largely dependent on private financial flows which are much more nervous and fickle than official commitments .  
The underdevelopment of the financial sector is a particularly important example of this general problem : in the absence of an effective institutional and regulatory framework for banking and other financial activities , credit risks will not be undertaken on the basis of a commercial evaluation of risks and returns , and this lack of financial discipline leads to the financial sector being an obstacle rather than a support to sustained economic growth and the creation of a modern capitalist economy .  
It is against this background that developing and transitional economy countries must grapple with the problem of maximizing the mobilization of financial resources from both domestic and foreign sources while at the same time ensuring that those resources are used in the most efficient and productive way so as to benefit all classes of the population , including the poor , and that public financial operations are reliably accounted for so as to inspire confidence among both citizens and foreign donors and investors .  
Efforts to increase the aggregate volume of personal savings deposited with financial institutions have involved the use of various incentives adapted to the social and economic conditions in the countries concerned .  
However , in Central and Eastern Europe ( including the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ) the difficulties inherent in introducing viable market and State mechanisms ab initio to replace the defunct system of control and command took a severe toll , with sharp declines in industrial output , shortfalls in agricultural production , disruption of trade flows , external financial strains and fiscal imbalances .  
A number of delegations expressed their concerns in regard to the serious financial situation of the Centre , with many noting that the financial resources available to the Centre were inadequate and that the Centre required enhanced financial as well as human resources if it were to meet its challenges at the global , regional , national and local levels .  
The arrangements agreed stress cooperation and coordination , and are rooted in recognition by all those involved of the need to achieve and maintain a streamlined process , avoiding duplication of effort and promoting efficiency and cost-effective use of human and financial resources while ensuring provision of the necessary information to the various fora charged with monitoring the actions of governments , their partners in civil society and those of international institutions , working in a coordinated manner to achieve the Summit objectives .  
In this connection , some Governments have argued that the acceptance of gratis personnel performing mandated activities would not , therefore , involve additional financial liability for the Organization since support costs have already been included in the budgets ; this argument is valid only if the gratis personnel are to be considered a substitute for staff to be recruited against authorized posts for the implementation of the approved activities .  
One critical constraint had been the lack of adequate financial resources , both from national budgets and from traditional sources of development assistance to support TCDC activities and another was the ineffective functioning of TCDC national focal points .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti until payment is effected .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force until payment is effected .  
While every effort was made to anticipate potential problems in the process leading up to the conclusion of the Memorandum of Understanding on the basis of which the programme is being executed , the complicated nature of the programme , including its managerial , administrative and financial aspects , has led to a number of difficulties and delays in the initial stages of its implementation .  
Missions , at the request of Governments , to provide assistance in the fields of governance and public administration policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform , electoral assistance , government capacity for improved performance in the public sector , government capacity for developing infrastructure and protecting the environment , post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction of government machinery , government capacity for social development , financial management , government accounting and reporting and public-private interaction ; ( ii ) Group training .  
In 1995 , the gross domestic product stood at US $ 96 million , while per capita it increased to $ 6,415 .  4 .  The performance of the Turks and Caicos economy in 1995 was characterized by continued rapid growth in tourism , a steady rise in offshore financial services business and an increase in fishing activities , combined with lower inflation rates and a slight reduction in the unemployment rate .  
General information on the Territorys offshore financial services industry is contained in the previous working paper prepared by the Secretariat ( A / AC . 109 / 2051 , paras . 12 and 13 ) .  15 .  Among the attractions for offshore companies are the use of the United States dollar as the official currency , the absence of direct taxation , a growing financial infrastructure , fast and straightforward company registration procedures , extensive financial freedom and confidentiality .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 9 above , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of [ 102,706,078 dollars gross ( 105,971,529 dollars net ) ] in respect of the period ending 30 June 1996 ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium until payment is effected .  
This environment , in turn , is determined primarily by the monetary , fiscal , trade and other policies of major industrialized countries , by market and technological forces and trends and , for developing countries at least , by the policies pursued by multilateral financial institutions and WTO , as well as by the state of development cooperation in general .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
In a world of integrated financial markets and rapid capital movements , it is also essential to ensure the soundness of the banking system through prudential regulations , better assessment of credit risks , stringent capital requirements , actions to prevent money laundering , improved management of banks and better regulation of security markets .  
The Council may urge that structural reforms aimed at establishing a competitive domestic financial system , privatization and / or restructuring of public enterprises continue to be implemented in order to enhance the efficient allocation of resources and support private sector development ; such reforms are also expected to boost domestic savings and investment and thereby contribute to higher economic growth .  
As the scale of foreign capital has increased in the financial markets of certain developing countries , these markets have become highly vulnerable to shifts in sentiment among international investors and fund managers , especially since an important part is of a short-term speculative nature .  
The amount of resources potentially available under NAB is roughly $ 47-billion , double the amount that has been available under the General Arrangements to Borrow ( GAB ) , and the number of potential participating countries or monetary authorities with the financial capacity to support the international monetary system has increased to 25 , including a number of developing countries .  
In response to an initiative at the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven , a Working Party of the Group of Ten and emerging market economies is developing , with the support of all relevant institutions , a concerted international strategy to promote the establishment , adoption and implementation of sound principles and policies needed for financial stability . 
Among the contributing factors to this surge in private flows are the high growth rates experienced by many developing countries , the spread of market reforms and , in particular , the deregulation of private capital flows , the liberalization of world trade , the rise of global institutional investors and the accelerating capitalization of emerging markets and their integration into world financial markets .  
The potential negative effects of trade liberalization on the least developed and net food importing countries should be mitigated by increased financial and technical assistance .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti until payment is effected .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 9 above , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 87,793,328 dollars gross ( 92,251,479 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1996 ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina until payment is effected .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium until payment is effected .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force until payment is effected .  
The planned improvement of the mechanism of trade and economic relations must provide for the creation of the necessary conditions for developing market-based cooperation , broader access of Russian and Ukrainian capital to each other 's markets , the development of joint investment projects , the formation of transnational financial and industrial groups and the creation of intergovernmental special-purpose programmes .  
Under current trends in global interdependence , international governance would require reaching a global compact on means to enhance job creation at the national level through orderly management of financial and trade flows and through promotion of democratic systems and respect for fundamental labour standards . 
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
UNDP has played a key role in the development of a common understanding of the programme approach which is now contained in the Operational Activities Reference Manual published in 1996 by the Consultative Committee on Programme and Operational Questions ( CCPOQ ) with significant substantive and financial support from UNDP . 
As indicated in the report on follow-up to the decisions taken by the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 1996 , CCPOQ , with considerable substantive and financial assistance from UNDP , published an operational activities reference manual , which has now been forwarded to all country offices and will serve as a unifying framework within which each agency will operate using its own detailed operational procedures .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
It is of the utmost importance that the Commission be granted the necessary financial means to start operating as soon as possible , in order to maintain the current momentum in favour of clarifying the past so that the country can move forward in the daunting tasks of national reconstruction and reconciliation .  
The second option would be to deploy a United Nations peacekeeping force , composed mainly of African contingents provided with adequate military capability and with sufficient financial and logistical support to fulfil the challenging tasks entrusted to it .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its decision 1996 / 114 , mindful of the need for and merit of having a consolidated set of the rules of procedure that are fully applicable to it , decided to entrust Mr . Ribot Hatano with the task of preparing , without financial implications , a working paper relating to the methods of work of the Sub _ Commission , to be submitted to it at its forty _ ninth session as a basis for discussion , which would contain :  
The Committee recommended the establishment of specific machinery located at the highest policy level , with adequate financial and human resources , that would coordinate and guide action in favour of women , would be able to prevent the persistence of attitudes , prejudices and stereotypes that discriminate against women and would narrow the gap between de jure and de facto equality .  
Referring to Recommendation No .  3 of the Committee 's eighth session , in which the Committee invited the Director-General to examine the possibility of establishing an international fund intended to facilitate the restitution of stolen or illicitly exported cultural objects in cases where the countries concerned are unable to meet the related financial costs ,  
The inventory of financial needs and the data base of financial sources would have the following characteristics in order to ensure their effective use : ( i ) available to participants in the CCD consultative processes ; ( ii ) disseminated through various channels , including the Internet ; ( iii ) packaged to meet the needs of customers ; and ( iv ) frequently updated .  27 .  Inventory of financial requirements .  
While it was true that developing countries bore the primary responsibility for solving their human settlements problems , the international community , and the developed countries in particular , should endeavour to create a favourable international environment for the development of human settlements by providing sufficient financial resources and technologies to the developing countries .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
Given the severe and irreversible health effects of lead poisoning , particularly on children , it is important to accelerate the process of eliminating unsafe uses of lead , including the use of lead in gasoline worldwide , in light of country-specific conditions and with enhanced international support and assistance to developing countries , particularly through the timely provision of technical and financial assistance and the promotion of endogenous capacity-building .  
Consideration should be given to the gradual implementation of pricing policies that are geared towards cost recovery and the equitable and efficient allocation of water , including the promotion of water conservation , in developed countries ; such policies could also be considered in developing countries when they reach an appropriate stage in their development , so as to promote the harmonious management and development of scarce water resources and generate financial resources for investment in new water supply and treatment facilities .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the debt problem , including debt relief in the form of debt rescheduling , debt reduction , debt swaps and , as appropriate , debt cancellation , as well as grants and concessional flows that will help restore creditworthiness .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
Indeed , while we applaud the recognition granted to local government in Chapter 28 of Agenda 21 , the two pages in that Chapter hardly reflect the immense financial , infrastructure , administrative and governmental contribution of local Governments to the green and brown agendas or to the agendas of the North and South .  
Specifically , we advocate increased official development assistance , more transparent and democratic financial mechanisms , the transfer of suitable and environmentally benign technologies on concessional terms , the reorientation of technical cooperation to respond to the forces of demand in developing countries in such a way as to utilize and build indigenous expertise , the development of human resources and an improvement in the management systems and processes that run our institutions .  
Accordingly , the developing countries committed themselves to doing everything to preserve and protect the environment , while the developed countries , beyond their ecological obligations , were to provide new and additional financial resources in order to create an international economic environment conducive to the struggle against poverty .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .  
Unfortunately and I repeat , unfortunately the persistent reluctance of the countries of the North to respect their commitments to the developing countries by granting additional financial resources , increasing public development aid to 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and transferring eco-technologies under favourable conditions , is considerably restricting the capacity of these countries to meet the requirements of sustainable development . 
Violations committed on national territory , most of which are considered to be justiciable offences , include : misappropriation of public funds , misuse of company assets , corruption , tax and customs evasion , financial speculation , fraudulent or unlawful enrichment , exploitation of illegal labour and migrant workers , etc .  
In order to achieve the efficient utilization of resources and the streamlined and transparent financial and budgetary procedures envisaged in resolution 49 / 233 , the Special Committee urges the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to develop a coherent strategy for logistic support of peacekeeping operations .  
It should determine specific measures to foster an enabling international environment conducive to providing developing countries with increased financial and technical assistance , access to financial flows on a predictable and assured basis , increased foreign direct investment and a durable solution to debt problems .  
The Seminar pointed out the fundamental contradiction between the increasing restrictions to individual mobility and the free flow of goods and services as encouraged by transnational corporations and international financial institutions .  
The success of collective response to humanitarian crises depends not only on a well _ coordinated and integrated plan of action , but also on the availability of the human , material and financial resources necessary to ensure that timely assistance is provided .  
The Fund has maintained a solid financial standing and has been utilized by operational organizations of the United Nations system on 48 occasions to meet urgent relief requirements .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium until payment is effected .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force until payment is effected .  
They shall take joint actions in international financial and economic organizations with a view to ensuring appropriate funding for projects agreed on at the trilateral level , including requests to make use of the European Union 's integrated international assistance programmes , such as Poland-Hungary Aid for the Reconstruction of the Economy ( PHARE ) and technical assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States ( TACIS ) , as well as appropriate programmes within the framework of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation .  
In paragraph 11 of the resolution the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to convene in 1997 another meeting of governmental experts from land-locked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems in the land-locked and transit developing countries and to explore the possibility of formulating specific action-oriented measures .  
In order to facilitate the review of the progress in the development of transit systems by the above mentioned meeting of governmental experts convened pursuant to paragraph 11 of General Assembly 50 / 97 , the Secretary-General of UNCTAD made arrangements , with the financial support of the UNDP , to undertake comprehensive regional and subregional analytical studies which highlighted recent developments on the transit transport sector of land-locked and transit developing countries and made recommendations for future action .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
In addition to expertise and support relating to the political , diplomatic and military aspects of designing and negotiating a disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programme , financial and developmental assistance from the international donor community , humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations have proven equally essential .  
In the face of those developments , on 20 July 1997 , Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus announced a number of measures which would be implemented towards economic and financial integration to alleviate the effects of the illegal embargoes on the Turkish Cypriots and to forge closer ties in defence and foreign policy with a view to protecting the legitimate interests of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 46 / 122 of 17 December 1991 by which it established the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery to assist representatives of non _ governmental organizations to participate in the deliberations of the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery by providing them with financial assistance and to extend through established channels of assistance , humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been severely violated as a result of contemporary forms of slavery ,  
The International Monitoring Committee to supervise the implementation of the Bangui Agreements , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
This section analyses provisions on financial transfers and mechanisms in recent MEAs ( in particular provisions on " compliance assistance " contained in the Montreal Protocol , the CBD and the FCCC ) , as well as other ways of generating new public and private financial resources to assist developing countries in promoting sustainable development and more particularly in tackling global environmental problems .  
Ensuring " additionality " in JI raises several conceptual and practical questions , including those relating to methods for establishing and calculating baselines , determining emissions reduced or sequestered , financial additionality , and moral hazard ( incentives for parties to a project to exaggerate its impact ) .  
MicroStart provides institutional and capital support to micro finance institutions and networks in 25 pilot countries , thereby increasing direct access to financial services and building on the indigenous economic capacity of poor people and microentrepreneurs .  24 .  UNDP also supported a project on social exclusion that analysed the processes and patterns that prevent people from taking part in the economic and social life of their community .  
Although the world economy was becoming more integrated through trade and other financial flows , and offers mutual benefits and growing opportunities for economic expansion to participating countries , it also generated social dislocation and demands difficult policy adjustments .  
Some of the concerns included the fact that economic policies were increasingly affected by the sentiments of a globalized financial market ; that greater openness also implied greater vulnerability to shocks in the international economic system ; and that heightened international economic competition and greater capital mobility weakened the bargaining position of labour , exerted downward pressure on labour standards and compromised the capacity of Governments to implement countervailing social policies .  
For this purpose , and in order to ensure a broad-based origin and application of such a methodology , the Department of Economic and Social Affairs should convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .  
Major impediments on the supply side are production and export structures that concentrate on only a few products , poor endowment with financial and human capital , weak technological capacity , inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks , and bottlenecks in physical infrastructure . 
It should be noted that , in view of the budgetary austerity and the restrictive monetary and fiscal environment accompanying the structural adjustment of Bulgaria 's economy , effective attainment of the goals of the National Plan of Action would require the extensive cooperation of international organizations and institutions and also financial contributions .  
Successful implementation of the Platform for Action depended on the contribution of all the participants - Governments , civil society and international organizations - and while the primary responsibility for implementation lay at the national level , international cooperation was crucial , particularly with regard to fulfilling commitments to provide financial resources .  
The enormous cost of and rapid change in information and communications technology were posing immense financial and technical difficulties , thus increasing the gap between developed and developing countries in that field .  
The closure had had a negative effect on the economic and social situation of the occupied territories with at least 10 per cent of the population living below the poverty line and the losses resulting from the current closure estimated at more than US $ 6 million a day , which was more than the financial assistance provided by foreign donors .  
Recognizing also that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , and fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements ,  
Strongly urge the industrialized countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources to meet their commitments under and the requirements of Agenda 21 and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent gross national product ( GNP ) as official development assistance immediately , and also to ensure that within that target 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of GNP is earmarked for least developed countries ;  
His delegation looked forward to the special session of the General Assembly for the review of Agenda 21 , which it hoped would provide policy guidelines in the critical areas of sustainable development and adopt measures to achieve sustainable development goals , in particular through the provision of adequate financial resources , the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the creation of institutional mechanisms . 
Other measures taken included the provision of additional developed land and adequate financial assistance , the promotion of energy-saving building materials and cost-effective construction technologies , the upgrading of unusable housing , special programmes for the disadvantaged and for women , programmes linking improved housing to the eradication of poverty , the support for development of the informal sector , the introduction of land reform , and public and private-sector partnerships .  
Today 's cities were faced with a lack of financial resources and socio-economic and demographic pressures ; the gap between rich and poor was widening , providing basic social services was increasingly difficult , health , environmental and security problems were getting worse and unsustainable patterns of production and consumption were becoming widespread . 
A common vision had developed that sound financial and economic policies , including development of human resources and respect for human rights , good governance , individual initiative and the private sector , were critical to creating an environment conducive to economic growth , environmental sustainability and social equity .  
In view of the limited budgetary resources allocated to development , some sectors had shown a marked interest in broadening the purview of the financial institutions and intergovernmental organizations with respect to development issues , which would , in the long run , have the effect of reducing still further the participation of developing countries in the international decision-making process , contrary to the principles of the Charter and to the global dimension which should characterize the solution of the world 's problems .  
For the first time , more than half the gross domestic product had been generated by the private sector , and more favourable conditions for national and foreign investors had been created through the ongoing privatization process , the completion of the first phase of financial stabilization , the gradual liberalization of domestic and foreign trade and the introduction of a new national currency .  
The adverse effects included an increase in poverty , a reduction in the financial resources that were vital for development , the placing in jeopardy of fiscal and monetary policy and economic reform , and an erosion of the capacity of the country targeted to participate fully in world trade and capital markets .  
That was of particular importance in the preparatory process for the World Food Summit , which would deal with the fundamental right of every human being to be free from hunger and malnutrition , international cooperation for the elimination of unilateral economic and trade measures , eradication of poverty , and international mobilization and channelling of technical , technological and financial resources so as to improve access to food for all .  
While his delegation supported the reform of the Economic and Social Council , the reform process would not solve all the problems facing the international community , since institutional reforms must be complemented by a sound resource base for implementing approved strategic and financial plans .  
These mechanisms consist , among others , of annual financial reports , semi-annual reports , quarterly reports , audited reports by internal and external auditors , field visits by agency personnel , regular monitoring by geographical desks , narrative reports on progress , regular operational reporting and meetings , as well as mid-term and final reports on activities and finance ( see table 6 below ) . 
Owing to the increasing globalization of the economy and the interdependence of national economies , the external debt problem must be addressed through a comprehensive , integrated and development-oriented approach , involving an open , rule-based and non-discriminatory international trading system , increased financial flows and increased access to technology .  
Lastly , he endorsed the view expressed in paragraph 51 of the report that limiting the exposure of middle-income countries to the more volatile forms of finance before their economies were ready and maintaining the confidence of international financial investors was central to avoiding new crises , and that while individual countries had a central responsibility in that regard , the international community was also undertaking to play a greater role . 
The efforts of developing countries to mobilize domestic resources should be supported by external resources commensurate with their needs ; accordingly , the depletion of financial assistance agreed and committed by the developed countries , particularly official development assistance , was cause for concern .  
In that regard , the figures contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the net transfer of resources between developing and developed countries ( A / 51 / 291 ) showed the unpredictable and unsustainable nature of financial flows in the international capital markets , which was aggravated by increasing interdependence and financial integration .  
Since debt problems varied considerably from country to country , debt relief measures needed to be adapted to the needs of each case ; to that end , through an evolving debt strategy , the international financial community had contributed significantly to the introduction of improvements in developing countries based on sound economic policies and programmes of adjustment and reform .  
The situation was particularly difficult for the developing countries since the liberalization of their foreign transactions made them increasingly vulnerable to the unpredictable fluctuations of private capital flows in the international financial markets .  
Despite the decisive role of domestic policy in respect of the influx of private capital , it was essential to take measures at the international level to ensure the effectiveness of domestic reforms ; in that respect it should be recalled that , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 50 / 91 , cooperation and coordination must be broadened among interested countries and the Bretton Woods institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries .  
She stressed the urgent need for the international community and the multilateral financial institutions to formulate strategies that would significantly reduce the debt stock to a sustainable or manageable level that would not impede the implementation of development programmes or deter investors .  
She hoped , however , that the international community would not limit its efforts to the application of that initiative but would also propose solutions that were suitable to the developing countries , especially the least developed ones , so that they could use their national financial resources to undertake economic reforms that were vital for their development .  85 .  Mr . OUCH ( Cambodia ) said that he fully supported the statement made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China .  
The Government of the United States of America has not only deliberately ignored the opinion and decisions of the international community and the purposes and principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations , but has also decided to step up its economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba , in this case by means of the law known as the Helms-Burton Act , whose scope exceeds that of all previous legislation by grouping together , intensifying and conferring legal status on all earlier measures and provisions relating to the blockade . 
The International Monitoring Committee , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
At its sixth session , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice again discussed the smuggling of illegal migrants . 47 Members of the Commission noted that the smuggling of illegal migrants not only caused mental and physical harm and financial hardship to the illegal migrants , but also affected the social stability and bilateral relations of the countries involved . 
It needs to be questioned to what extent this secrecy is compatible with the access to information necessary for democratic practice and social justice and whether , in some cases , instead of contributing to long-term security , it may conceal information about processes ( ecological , financial , military , etc . ) which are a potential threat to everyone and which need therefore to be addressed collectively . 
For example , financial contributions to relevant multilateral institutions and programmes were often not reported , many national communications provided limited detail on bilateral programmes related to the implementation of the Convention , and there was little discussion of transfer of technology through the private sector . 
If the Council approved his recommendations , the Secretary-General intended to dispatch a technical team to the mission area during the first half of October 1997 to reassess the resources required for the deployment of MINURSO at full strength and would revert to the Council in November , with a comprehensive report including a detailed plan , timetable and financial implications for the holding of the referendum of self-determination and fulfilment of the United Nations objectives in Western Sahara . 
In general , receiving departments have accepted the Investigations Section \ x { e5b8 } recommendations , but implementation is delayed for reasons that include the need to obtain additional legal advice on implementation methods and processes ; administrative and / or disciplinary processes are begun that take protracted periods of time ; financial implications are assessed ; and all due process requirements are observed .  
Those audits disclosed various financial control weaknesses and recurring problems , such as delayed or unreliable financial and narrative reporting , making it difficult for UNHCR to determine the extent to which funds were being used for the intended purposes .  
After years of living under centrally planned regimes where the private sector hardly existed as in the countries of eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union most fledgling entrepreneurs lacked financial and business experience and the facilities were not available for them to start operating .  
As a result , the Organizations financial situation today is characterized by continuing arrearage levels in absolute terms ; mounting arrearage levels in relative terms ; continuing shortages and persistent intervals of regular budget cash deficits ; prolonged periods and increasing levels of borrowing from peacekeeping cash for regular budget purposes ; and persistent levels of debt to Member States for troops and equipment .  
As a result of that practice , the Organization 's financial situation was characterized by continuing levels of arrears in absolute terms and mounting levels of arrears in relative terms ; continuing shortages and persistent intervals of regular budget cash deficits ; prolonged periods and increasing levels of borrowing from peacekeeping cash for regular budget purposes ; and persistent levels of debt to Member States for troops and equipment .  3 .  At the end of September 1997 , preliminary figures for unpaid assessments for the regular budget , peacekeeping operations and the international tribunals totalled $ 2.417-billion .  
Many countries acknowledged that the root causes of the continuing financial crisis were , on the one hand , a poorly thought out and excessive expansion of the scope of United Nations activities during the previous decade , which had had an adverse impact on the effectiveness of the activities of almost all the specialized agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations , and , on the other hand , the unjust apportionment of the Organization 's expenses among its Member States .  
Despite the severe economic difficulties brought about by the unjust economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba , her Government had paid the sum of $ 1.193-million to the Organization during the previous week ; that was a reflection of Cuba 's commitment to the Organization .  
Promote and co-operate in providing the necessary financial and technological resources for the sustainable management , conservation and enhancement , as appropriate , of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol , including biomass , forests and oceans as well as other terrestrial , coastal and marine ecosystems .  
Promote and co-operate in providing the necessary financial and technological resources for the full , open and prompt exchange of relevant scientific , technological , technical , socio-economic and legal information related to the climate system and climate change , and to the economic and social consequences of various response strategies , including through the establishment of relevant mechanisms for this purpose in the subsidiary bodies of the Convention .  
In the opinion of the Government of Cuba , unilateral coercive measures are also blatantly interventionist and discriminatory and are applied through a wide range of economic instruments , basically related to trade , financial , technological or investment restrictions , which in any of their variants are designed to cause a critical economic situation that will force the State concerned to change the policy or policies objected to by the State applying the measures .  
Since recovering its full independence in 1959 , Cuba has been subjected to all manner of coercive measures , characterized by pressure , threats and hostilities whose stated purpose is to subvert the political , economic and social alternative chosen by the Cuban people in exercise of their sovereignty .  The clearest expression of this increasingly aggressive conduct is the permanent economic , commercial and financial blockade unilaterally imposed against Cuba for almost four decades by the Government of the United States of America , involving an endless list of various types of coercive economic measures .  
Under those circumstances , the international community has shown its recognition of the urgent need for the creation of a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system through the adoption of various resolutions and agreements at all levels . 
Given a wide variety of types of sanctions , all cases were divided into three categories : ( a ) limited , that is , minor financial , export , cultural or travel sanctions ; ( b ) moderate , that is , broader trade or financial sanctions ; and ( c ) extensive , that is , comprehensive trade and financial sanctions .  
IPA will be promoted through various means : first , by ensuring that inter-ministerial national drug-control commissions are fully involved in operational activities , thus strengthening their coordination and planning functions ; secondly , by promoting planning and operational linkages with Governments , agencies in the United Nations system , international financial institutions , and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations through the incorporation of the drug dimension into mainstream socio-economic development programmes ; and thirdly , by fostering broader social awareness of the deleterious political , social and economic consequences of drug abuse and the illicit drug industry .  
The drug dimension was incorporated with UNDCP assistance into mainstream national health , education , social welfare , critical poverty and rural development programmes , by elaborating new drug-control partnerships with sectoral ministries , relevant United Nations organizations , international financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , private industry and other partners .  
Similarly , most UNDCP technical and financial resources for alternative development in the Andean region no longer support a wide range of isolated model projects , but rather aim at strengthening the institutional capacities of national alternative development entities and their programmes .  
Activities will encompass the provision of advisory services to Governments ; assistance for the introduction of relevant legislation , such as promoting mutual legal assistance ; support to improve the capacity of legal and related law enforcement systems , including the establishment of financial intelligence units or similar bodies ; organization of major international training events ; applied research into economic and legal aspects of the problem , and further development of the AMLID database system .  
Funds received or pledges recorded as receivable , attributable to future financial periods and , therefore , not credited to the income account of the period reported on .  
In the interests of prudent financial management , up to half of the value of conditional pledges from Governments and firm pledges made by organizations of established repute are recognized as income at the time the pledge is received .  
In developing countries and in western financial capitals , there is now a growing acceptance that premature liberalization of capital markets has been a primary cause of the current crisis .  
We believe that this should be linked to a new system of international financial markets which would be more transparent and efficient and thus responsive and adaptable to the changing financial conditions in the world markets .  
Therefore , we support the search for effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and monetary fluctuations in order to ensure fair competition and to organize financial transactions on sound and solid bases .  
Our interdependence is increasing through international legally binding commitments , the adoption of policies reaching across national borders , enhanced trade and financial flows , and markets which have become fully integrated on a global scale .  
Much concern has been expressed about the devastating social consequences of the current financial crisis , particularly massive unemployment , the loss of health and educational services , and the consequent increase in poverty in affected countries .  
Transnational corporations now have greater freedom to set up in countries where , owing to political , economic or social constraints or a lack of human and financial resources , environmental legislation is rudimentary , non _ existent or poorly enforced .  
Because many MFIs do not have a clear legal status , are not currently regulated by banking authorities and can not issue negotiable instruments , innovative ways are required to address the economic , financial , legal and administrative issues raised .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
This paragraph refers to the need for additional financial resources to halt the continuing deterioration in the health and nutritional status of the Iraqi people and in the relevant infrastructure , which has a direct impact on the worsening of the situation .  
Although his Government had been successful in attracting private capital through a policy of privatization and facilitating foreign investment , financial flows to developing countries were determined largely by the major industrialized States .  
In conclusion , the developing countries continued to need a considerable infusion of external resources at the national level , but would also need to be given voice and justice in the international councils on financial and monetary issues .  
There is , however , a continuing need for strong action in this area since small island developing States remain constrained by limited financial , human and technical resources .  
The Special Committee had considered practical steps to ensure that future peacekeeping operations would have a sound logistical and predictable financial basis .  
The vast financial and human resources available to the illicit drugs trade , in many cases exceeding the resources of national Governments , have made international cooperation and coordination imperative to an effective anti-drugs strategy .  
Furthermore , the distribution of private financial flows to the developing countries had remained highly uneven , so that the rapid growth of foreign direct investment did not represent a growing benefit for all the developing countries .  
There is , however , a continuing need for strong action in this area because small island developing States remain constrained by limited financial , human and technical resources .  
This objective can be served by multilateral mechanisms that monitor all national economic policies affecting international capital flows and other monetary and financial variables .  
The vast financial and human resources available to the illicit drugs trade , in many cases exceeding the resources of national Governments , have made international cooperation and coordination imperative for an effective anti-drugs strategy .  
Where a countrys capacity to develop and implement a comprehensive economic programme has been disrupted by conflict , consideration must be given to relaxing the normally strict financial conditions imposed by international lending institutions .  
We appeal to all parties at the global , regional and country levels to ensure that adequate financial resources are forthcoming so that the immense potential of volunteer contributions , now and into the next century , are fully realised .  
The meeting concluded that a comprehensive report examining the adequacy of observational networks , identifying the existing gaps and quantifying the financial and human resources required , should be prepared for the ninth session of the SBSTA .  
Pursuant to various legislative mandates , the United Nations Programme in Public Administration and Finance has sought to meet the expressed needs of developing countries in improving their administrative and financial management systems for development .  
A well developed financial sector is critical in stimulating private domestic savings and investment in Africa to achieve sustained economic growth and development .  
Four main drivers may be identified : ( i ) regulations and market _ based instruments ; ( ii ) education , information and public pressure ; ( iii ) economic and financial considerations ; and ( iv ) tax policy .  
Tax administrators from developing and transitional economy countries encounter considerable difficulties in understanding the controversial taxation issues involved in , for example , transfer pricing mechanisms and innovative financial instruments .  
The evaluations show that a major factor for achieving positive results is the availability of a critical mass of financial resources in order for the national programmes that the United Nations system is supporting to be effective .  
The need to set indigenous language literacy teaching within a well _ defined legal , administrative , financial and technical framework would appear to be self _ evident .  
But it is self-evident that our national and international commitment , as well as limited human financial and material resources , mandates bilateral and regional cooperation in battling the better-equipped narco-traffickers .  
While global financial integration had its positive aspects , it posed enormous challenges to some developing countries , particularly in view of the fluctuating international financial markets .  
If the benefits of the free movement of capital flows are to be retained , the problems of financial instability and negative socio-economic effects of financial turmoil need to be addressed at the national and international levels .  
For the medium term , his delegation supported calls for the development of a new international financial system based on increased accountability and global governance arrangements that were in keeping with the needs of the current globalized economy .  
The current financial turmoil , coming in the wake of the Mexican crisis , had exposed the inadequacy of existing institutions at the national and international levels , particularly in dealing with short-term capital flows .  
As the most representative of the existing multilateral institutions , the United Nations must be involved in all aspects of a process that had such broad economic , financial , political and social implications .  
First , obstacles or barriers ( including political , legal , bureaucratic , physical , financial , social and informational ) should be reduced .  
Ongoing civil and international conflicts , financial crises and natural disasters around the world ( including volcanic eruptions , hurricanes , tidal waves and floods ) have had severe impacts on the efficacy and efficiency in the delivery of social services .  
Bocalandro ( Argentina ) said that the current critical social situation which was due to unsuitable industrial structures , excessive bureaucracy and structural adjustments had been aggravated by the international financial crisis .  
His delegation supported the phasing out of gratis personnel and their replacement by international civil servants , and was opposed to any arbitrary financial ceiling that might adversely affect backstopping of peacekeeping operations .  
Regretting that the financial markets have exhibited extreme volatility , which has resulted in higher interest rate spreads and a sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Until the current crisis , the high level of global financial integration had allowed economies in transition to obtain the foreign direct investment they required owing to their insufficient domestic savings .  
In conclusion , he said that he wished to reiterate that UNEP needed a solid financial base in order to discharge its strengthened mandate and meet the growing environmental challenges worldwide .  
It was convinced that the adoption of appropriate economic policies and the committed participation of the industrialized countries and international financial institutions would make it possible to meet the challenges of sustainable development .  
In addition , the conversion of policy declarations into concrete policies and actions at both the national and the international levels required not only political will but also adequate allocations of financial and human resources .  
While the report attempted to reflect the total requirements of human and financial resources from all sources , it ought to have been more focused and analytical , and the assertions it contained were not supported by convincing analysis .  
In the interests of prudent financial management , up to half of the value of conditional pledges from Governments and firm pledges made by organizations of established repute are recognized as income at the time the pledge is received .  
The Act contains provisions common to all recent national legislative acts and addresses the basic concepts of literary and financial copyright , holders of copyright , the free use of protected works , period of copyright and means of protecting copyright .  
Thirdly , rather than providing temporary services for the poor , the main objective of IFAD is to develop viable and financially sustainable rural financial systems , especially for the very poor living in remote areas in many developing countries .  
All staff with supervisory / managerial responsibilities are required to have additional goals that relate to managing human and financial resources ; leading , motivating and developing staff ; and demonstrating gender and cross-cultural responsiveness ;  
They may include disrupted production due to the absence or higher cost of sanctioned supplies , suspended financial inputs and services , foregone profit tax or tariff revenues , lost jobs or income and the ensuing increase in social expenditures .  
IMF undertakes a periodic review of global capital markets , and principles adopted in the BIS committees may be included by IMF in its surveillance of the financial sectors of individual developed and developing countries .  
He noted that despite global economic and financial turmoil in several regions in the world , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) had continued to grow in 1997 and early 1998 , surpassing the growth of other aggregates such as GDP , exports and domestic investment .  
The need for preferential market access treatment remained strong , especially in the light of the economic slump in several dynamic developing countries as a result of the global financial crisis .  
In parallel , the system of international cooperation must be strengthened in order to transfer the financial , technological and scientific resources of the most highly developed economies to the developing countries .  
It stated that the prevention of financial crises required enhanced early warning mechanisms , including improved and effective surveillance of national and international financial market developments .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Regretting that the financial markets have exhibited extreme volatility , which has resulted in higher interest rate spreads and a sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Despite economic hardships exacerbated by the illegal economic , commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America , Cubas Government continued to devote a significant and growing proportion of its budget to social protection programmes .  
It was also apparent that prudential norms and strong supervisory capacity were required as much for facilitating efficient international intermediation of volatile capital flows as they were for an efficient domestic financial system .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , both domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
A sound financial sector , good governance , broad-based social investments , respect for human rights , and transparency in both the public and private sector were factors at the national level conducive to economic and social growth and development .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
Globalization phenomena should not be considered only for their impact on physical and financial capital flows , but also on human and natural capital , as well as on national sovereignty and cultural diversity , including at the local and community level .  
Under green aid , we would utilize official development assistance and private financial resources to cope with the issues of energy and global warming and promote cooperation with developing countries through the development of human resources .  
There are many obstacles to resolving the acute problems and to raising public awareness of the need to protect the environment during the current period of financial difficulties and economic instability coupled with poverty and weak discipline .  
An enabling external financial environment to support domestic measures could require , inter alia , adequate and transparent supervision of volatile , short-term capital flows .  
He said that the current economic outlook for Africa was not encouraging , as the region was suffering from the effects of the international financial crisis , reduced export demand and falling commodity prices .  
Ad hoc requests by international agencies lead to ad hoc data collection , crowding out limited financial and human resources , and thus interfering with regular national statistical programmes ;  
An enabling external financial environment to support domestic measures could require , inter alia , adequate and transparent supervision of volatile , short-term capital flows .  
He noted that despite global economic and financial turmoil in several regions in the world , foreign direct investment ( FDI ) had continued to grow in 1997 and early 1998 , surpassing the growth of other aggregates such as GDP , exports and domestic investment .  
An enabling external financial environment to support domestic measures could require , inter alia , adequate and transparent supervision of volatile , short-term capital flows .  
The need for preferential market access treatment remained strong , especially in the light of the economic slump in several dynamic developing countries as a result of the global financial crisis .  
In order to consider adequately the financial feasibility of the proposals and the likelihood of subsequent increases in the proposed prices , additional criteria may need to be considered , such as the costs for design and construction activities ; annual operation and maintenance costs ; present value of capital costs and operating costs ; and the amount of subsidy , if any , expected from the Government .  
Although the prime responsibility for the execution of regional programmes and projects rests with small island developing States Governments , in view of the meagre resources of individual small island developing States and the high costs of regional programmes there is an obvious need for adequate financial support from the international community for timely and effective implementation of regional programmes .  
Owing to the difficulties experienced by the UNOSOM administration during the life of the Operation which were attributable to the complexity of the political , military and security situation in the mission area , compounded by the magnitude of the residual administrative and financial tasks involved , the originally envisaged time-frame for the completion of the Operations liquidation process proved unrealistic .  
The Global Programme of Action states at the outset that its implementation will require new approaches by and new forms of collaboration among Governments , organizations and institutions with responsibilities and expertise relevant to marine and coastal areas , at all levels national , regional and global including the promotion of innovative financial mechanisms to generate needed resources .  
In the light of the above recommendations , the Special Representative urges the international community to adopt a comprehensive and systematic approach to providing financial and technical assistance to Rwanda , bearing in mind both the requirements of long-term development and the fact that the country has experienced a genocide combined with a continuing determination by the perpetrators to pursue their efforts at extermination .  
We are particularly concerned that poverty continues unabated ; financial resources have taken a downturn ; the transfer of environmental technologies has not materialized ; human-induced climate change has increased ; trade and investments have become more difficult for developing countries ; and globalization has unleashed new threats to sustainable development .  
With this in mind , Ecuador considers it necessary to promote initiatives to reevaluate the rural sector ; implement appropriate land-ownership policies to benefit the indigenous communities ; encourage internal and external financial mechanisms to allow them successfully to develop their productive capacities ; and strengthen the protection of their traditional and ancestral knowledge and practices regarding biodiversity .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
In light of the repatriation of the military engineering support unit during the 1998 / 99 financial period , it is proposed that the Missions civilian staffing establishment be reduced by 5 international and 10 local posts authorized in connection with the deployment of the unit ( see A / 52 / 730 / Add . 2 , paras . 23 and 24 ) .  
First , concerning the relationship between quality and quantity in the services provided by the Department and the resources allotted to its activities in the prevailing critical financial situation , it was evident that given the increased demand for public information the Department could not be expected to continue undertaking further responsibilities without additional resources .  
While welcoming the Departments efforts and noting its enormous advances in the electronic information field , his delegation believed it necessary to point out that , because of the manifold economic and financial problems faced by countries with economies in transition , the traditional mass media were still the principal sources of information there .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
However , despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of developing countries , including Mozambique , had implemented structural adjustment programmes , liberalized their economies and undertaken other reforms which had had serious social consequences , financial resource flows had diminished , resulting in a vicious circle of economic stagnation and financial crisis .  
To that end , international cooperation would have to be intensified by improving trade relations and access to markets , sharing new technologies , creating a favourable international financial and economic order and allocating increased development resources to developing countries .  
The current financial crisis , caused by massive inflows of private capital and their sudden reversal , had , however , forced the Committee to view the implications of private capital flows into developing countries from a completely different perspective .  
The current global financial crisis and the reduction in foreign investment capital flows had coincided with the implementation of an economic reform policy in Egypt which included a stabilization and restructuring process aimed at attracting investment capital flows and establishing a modern financial infrastructure , as well as the development of the banking sector and the creation of a stock exchange , again with a view to attracting investment and promoting privatization . 
Turning to the Secretary-Generals report on the financing of development ( A / 53 / 228 ) , she observed that the report was a reminder that there were dangers as well as opportunities in the international financial market place , such as the sudden change of direction in capital flows to the developing countries and the continuing shrinkage of official development assistance .  
Despite the efforts of the affected countries and the intervention of the multilateral financial institutions , the crisis had not abated and the potential consequences for those countries included a reduced rate of liberalization ; the possibility that they might seriously consider defaulting on their debt ; the contraction of expenditure , which inevitably meant reduced spending on social services ; and the possibility of widespread social and political upheaval .  
In terms of national strategies , many countries had undertaken policies aimed at strengthening fiscal performance , increasing domestic savings , strengthening financial sectors by improved regulation and monitoring and greater capital requirements , and increasing macroeconomic stability .  
The financing of development was a much bigger concern than the establishment of a new international financial system or the strengthening of the existing one , for it touched on the core requirement of development , namely , financing and encompassed a host of interrelated issues , including the mobilization of domestic resources ; development cooperation and official development assistance ; and the resources generated from trade and other export services . 
Mr . Beti ( Observer for Switzerland ) said that the area of activity of UNITAR was training and institutional capacity-building , which consisted of assisting developing countries and countries in transition to better understand international issues such as negotiation , the peaceful settlement of disputes , modern information and communications technologies , environmental development or sound financial management .  
The Assembly had mandated UNCTAD to undertake analysis of current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups . 
Concerning external debt , the agreed formulations on problems relating to debt workouts by countries hit by financial crisis and on the slow progress in the implementation of the World Bank / IMF HIPC initiative represented a significant advance in international consensus on the subject .  
Most developing countries encounter enormous difficulties in providing timely responses to the demands and to implement the substantive objectives of most instruments and conventions and in putting into practice their compliance requirements , due to their limited institutional and financial capacity , lack of manpower and managerial skills and inadequate or non-enforced national legislative frameworks to support these instruments .  
Such issues as trade , market access and transparency , and economic , environmental and social policies which directly or indirectly affect the forest sector , as well as governance and corruption , private investment , financial resources and transfer of technology , need to be addressed in an integrated manner to achieve efficiency and effective results . 
Second , financial aspects , recognizing that it is very difficult to rely on mobilizing domestic financial resources in very poor and populous countries where natural resources are degraded , and international cooperation will need to play a very key role .  
This would be accomplished by capitalizing on existing and potential public and private-sector financial resources , primarily at the global level , with a specific view to leveraging higher levels of private sector finance .  
The financial needs of developing countries with low forest cover require special consideration , balancing their genuine need for forest products and services with ecological , technical , financial and social feasibility .  
There was a growing realization that business was not only about wealth creation but also about assuming social responsibilities for issues such as humans rights and sustainable human development , and that globalization and trade liberalization had had some unforeseen negative effects , including financial instability .  
My Governments pattern of payments clearly reflects its unshakable determination to meet its budgetary obligations despite the extraordinary difficulties it is facing as a result of the rigid , irrational and inhuman economic , commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America on Cuba for more than three long decades .  
The Council expressed its concern at the fact that lack of adequate resources might impede progress in the operationalization of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme and called upon potential donors and relevant funding agencies to make significant and regular financial contributions for the formulation , coordination and implementation of technical assistance projects elaborated within the framework of the Programme .  
The degree of dangerousness will be assessed through a multidimensional approach based on different conceptual areas and related indicators that characterize organized criminal groups , such as financial strength , use of violence , capacity to infiltrate public institutions and legal environment in which they operate .  
It is obtained on the financial market primarily by means of loans extended to the project company by national or foreign commercial banks , typically using funds that originate from short - to medium-term deposits remunerated by those banks at floating interest rates .  
Many global and regional financial institutions and bilateral development funding agencies have established guidelines or other requirements governing procurement with funds provided by them , which is typically reflected in their standard loan agreements ( see also chap . 
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Failure in the implementation of policies for forest conservation and protected areas , because of inadequate coordination or existence of conflicting polices and practices , inappropriate implementation strategies or a lack of institutional financial and human resources , is widely acknowledged as a major reason for the failure to achieve forest conservation goals in some countries .  
Urge bilateral and international cooperation / development agencies and financial institutions to provide adequate resources to support the achievement of objectives of forest conservation , including protected forest areas , through institutional strengthening and capacity-building , research and education , access to and transfer of technology , technical and scientific cooperation , and community education and extension .  
While stabilization strategy is designed to calm financial and economic turbulence by curbing high inflation rates and curtailing enormous budget deficits in the short term , structural adjustment is aimed at restructuring the productive capacities in order to increase efficiency and help restore growth and , therefore , extends over the medium and long term .  
Emphasizes that , in developing countries , rural development remains central to efforts to eradicate poverty and that this often includes agrarian reform , investment in infrastructure , extension of rural financial intermediation , measures to ensure food security , the provision of better education , greater utilization of appropriate technology , fair prices to provide incentives for agricultural investment and increased productivity , including productivity in the informal sector ;  
In its assessment of UNDP financial risks , the international consulting firm engaged by the Administrator advised that organizations such as UNDP , which do not have access to the capital markets nor the ability to borrow from banks to cover periodic cash flow needs , should maintain in liquidity the equivalent of 6 to 12 months ' expenditure as a prudent level .  
In explaining the link between those key documents , the Executive Director emphasized the importance of distinguishing between the funding target of the MTP , which was intended to be a financial challenge , and the more conservative financial plan , which was based on a careful analysis of projected income and used for country programme and support budget allocations .  
The Greek Cypriot administration , which tries to present itself as the champion of conservation of cultural heritage , continues , on the one hand , to show utter contempt for what is left of the Turkish-Islamic heritage in South Cyprus , where Ottoman Turkish shrines are under threat of disintegration due to total neglect , and , on the other hand , systematically blocks the flow of any external financial or technical assistance to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus for conservation purposes .  
For the developing countries to be able to extricate themselves from the poverty , hunger , gross social inequality and other negative factors impeding their development , the developed countries should reverse the downward trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) flows , increase their support for aid programmes , and fulfil commitments made at conferences and other forums to provide financial resources for development .  
Under those circumstances , the international community was currently engaged in searching for an appropriate architecture for the international financial system , which should include the following basic elements : better regulation and supervision in all countries , based on a common set of norms ; better information and transparency ; and more effective surveillance .  
In that connection , Tunisia supported the establishment of effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and currency fluctuations with the aim of ensuring fair competition and organizing financial operations on sound and solid bases .  
Notes that the United Nations Programme of Advisory Services and Technical Assistance in the Field of Human Rights does not have sufficient funds to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends but are facing economic hardship ;  
Discussions around financial resources in IPF and IFF have also included such issues as effective private sector involvement ; integration with national policies and priorities and effective coordination ; the application of economic instruments and tax policies ; the mobilization of national financial resources ; and the possibility of finding a mechanism to raise funds to establish a forest fund dedicated to support activities aimed at sustainable forest management .  
Such negative attitudes often lead to passive or hidden discrimination against migrants , and recourse to civil remedies is constrained by the difficulty of proving formal violation of rights and the financial cost involved in the legal procedures .  
The Department of Social Affairs had also tried to reduce poverty by providing financial assistance to private institutions , food assistance to primary school children and children of poor families , financial and technical assistance to groups of poor families and other social welfare recipients undertaking economic activities , and by providing assistance to the children of the unemployed .  
Bearing in mind paragraph 10 above and given the urgent need to foster closer cooperation between Governments , United Nations bodies and other international organizations , international financial institutions , in particular the World Bank and the IMF , and non _ governmental organizations on an issue of critical importance to developing countries , particularly least developed and heavily indebted poor countries , the participants agreed to recommend to the Commission on Human Rights :  
In view of the current financial turmoil afflicting some developing countries and also in view of the next round of WTO negotiations , which were likely to deal with complex issues , the issues raised by the Group of 77 should not be lost in the preparatory process or during UNCTAD X .  
While it was true that financial mediation systems were needed , and that economic activity implied a certain degree of commercial activity , it should nevertheless be remembered that microcredit functioned at the level of the individual household , existed in a natural form and was not intended to transform poor women into economic agents like their counterparts in developed countries .  
Prompt and decisive action was needed to halt the decline in living standards in countries which had fallen prey to the global financial crisis , and Governments must enact policies to expand economic opportunities quickly for disadvantaged households and communities , and make them less vulnerable to future shocks .  
On the basis of the current formula , the operational reserve was set at the level of $ 200-million in 1997 and would be calculated for the biennium 1998-1999 at the level of $ 180-million , based on the resource projection presented to the Executive Board in the annual review of the financial situation , 1997 ( DP / 1998 / 29 ) .  
At a meeting with me , on 11 December 1998 , an ECOWAS ministerial delegation on the Guinea-Bissau issues reiterated that ECOWAS needed logistical and financial support in order to proceed with the speedy deployment of the ECOMOG interposition force , the key operational support instrument for the implementation of the Agreement on the ground .  The delegation emphasized the importance of United Nations / ECOWAS collaboration and asked me to appoint a representative in that country .  
It should also be emphasized that another of its objectives was to forestall the financial crisis facing the existing social security institutions in the medium term , and thereby ensure that their income would be sufficient to meet their obligations to pensioners and their administrative costs .  
The services recognized by this Act are of three kinds : ( a ) financial , such as cash payments , pensions , etc . ; ( b ) in kind , such as prosthetic and orthopaedic appliances , medicines and mechanical aids ; and ( c ) services of an assistance nature , such as medical , dental , surgical services , tests , etc .  
Furthermore , the network of the Centre for Initiatives and Advancement for Women , as part of a project receiving financial support from the European Union , is promoting an improvement in the status of women by increasing their active participation in the countrys development and thus affording equal opportunities for women to contribute effectively to national economic , social , cultural and political processes , placing special emphasis on rural areas .  
The project has already commissioned case studies of recent experiences in Indonesia , Sri Lanka and the Philippines and has identified key factors for successful residential photovoltaic programmes and ways to overcome the financial and institutional barriers to the use of solar power .  
It was emphasized that international agencies engaged in the provision of technical and financial assistance should take fully into account the fundamental role of criminal justice systems in the achievement of social development and economic growth .  
It stands to reason , therefore , that henceforth international security will be built more and more around the concept of international civil society in which , along with governments , international organizations , economic and financial institutions , an ever more prominent role will be played by citizens and their spokesmen _ the non _ governmental organizations . 
Such a mechanism should be written into the rules and conditions governing international financial contracts , in order to promote a better assessment of risks , eliminate irresponsible behaviour and reduce speculative short-term capital flows to emerging markets . 
With regard to the volatility of financial flows , he said that while the amount of those flows to the developing countries had increased from $ 100-billion in 1990 to over $ 250-billion in 1996 , they were composed almost entirely of private capital and were concentrated in a limited number of developing countries .  
In that context , it was important to explore the many proposals put forward , including that of the Intergovernmental Group of 24 on International Monetary Affairs on the establishment of a task force of developed and developing countries to design a more effective surveillance mechanism for international financial and capital flows , as well as improved national information systems .  
Global financial integration had helped to generate a massive expansion of private capital flows to some developing countries , but also posed enormous challenges to national financial and banking systems in terms of ensuring the sustainability of those flows .  
The recent financial turmoil had shown that countries must maintain constant vigilance over all economic , financial and institutional parameters in order to guard against the volatility of other markets and contagion effects , and that each country needed not only sound macroeconomic fundamentals , but also a strong financial and banking system with adequate supervisory and regulatory mechanisms , transparency and good governance .  
The European Union recognized that external debt overhang remained a major obstacle to sustainable development in many poor developing countries and that solutions must continue to be sought to prevent the burden of debt service from offsetting the benefits of reforms in those countries and to ensure their access to financial markets .  
Mr . Amorim ( Brazil ) , speaking also on behalf of the members and associate members of the Common Market of the Southern Cone ( MERCOSUR ) , said that the worsening of the crisis in the international financial markets threatened to seriously reduce global economic activity and employment .  
The leaders of the MERCOSUR countries had been stressing for some time the need to promote closer cooperation between monetary authorities at the global level , better coordination of the macroeconomic policies of countries which had the greatest impact on international finances , proper supervision of agents in international financial markets and stabilization of currencies that were the subject of speculation .  
His Government believed that deregulation in the national financial sector should not be carried to the extreme of absolute laissez-faire , that foreign direct investment was of particular interest to the developing countries , although it should be adapted to the social , economic and environmental priorities of the receiving country , and that it was not easy to distinguish between unstable flows and long-term investment , which should be promoted .  
Ms . Cardoze ( Panama ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , said that the consequences for the Rio Group region of the global financial crisis which had begun during the previous year had included a decrease of two percentage points in the growth rate of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , a decline in imports and exports , particularly of raw materials and semi-manufactured products , an increase in the current account deficit and , in some cases , a decrease in international reserves .  
The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .  
Furthermore , pending the revision of paragraphs ( f ) and ( g ) of financial rule 110.19 as called for in General Assembly resolution 52 / 226 , paragraph 18 , he had issued a memorandum in April 1998 to ensure that the procurement of professional supplies , medicines , medical supplies , hospital or surgical supplies and prosthetic appliances were no longer exempt from competitive bidding .  
The alternative approach that was suggested ( i.e . , the inclusion of an open-ended provision describing such financial practices in sufficiently broad terms to cover existing practices and future developments ) was found to be impractical in view of the difficulty of describing a wide range of heterogeneous and rapidly changing practices with sufficient precision .  
It recognized , however , the need to extend sympathetic understanding to Member States temporarily unable to meet their financial obligations owing to genuine economic difficulties .  
The additional resources would enable the Secretary-General to make available an expanded range of programmes aimed at building and strengthening core organizational and managerial competencies ; to provide greater opportunities for staff at all levels to upgrade specific technical and substantive skills ; to support the decentralization of human and financial resource management responsibilities ; and to strengthen career support mechanisms .  
New modular programmes would be introduced to build specific core and managerial competencies and to build requisite skills for managing human and financial resources in a decentralized environment with increased delegation of authority and accountability ;  
Specifically , Member States will have received timely and effective assistance upon request to deal with new crime challenges , especially transnational organized crime , trafficking in human beings , economic and financial crimes and corruption .  
The Programme will provide advisory services to the judicial , financial and law enforcement sectors at the national level , as well as data and analysis of money-laundering issues and trends so that Member States will be aware of pressing issues , formulate and implement adequate policies to fight effectively against money-laundering .  
Concerned States will be assisted to secure adequate financial and technical assistance and support for their alternative development programmes , particularly from the international financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , relevant United Nations organizations and the private sector .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
The Report commented that effective national insolvency regimes contribute to crisis prevention by providing the predictable legal framework needed to address the financial difficulties of troubled firms before the accumulated financial difficulties of the corporate sector spill over into an economy-wide payments crisis .  
In view of the crisis with regard to private capital flows and the further decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) since 1997 , it will be necessary to again demonstrate that ODA is a main source of external funding for developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , and that the fulfilment of all financial commitments of Agenda 21 must be an integral part of the ODA reform discussion .  
While ongoing efforts to reform the international financial architecture and improve economic management will reduce the risks of future crises , there is growing recognition of the need to proceed , in parallel , with efforts to strengthen social policies and institutions , including industrial relations systems and institutions for social dialogue .  
The unacceptable and unsustainable social costs of recent financial crises have stimulated intensive discussion during the past months within the United Nations system , including the World Bank , on principles of good social policy to be applied at both national and international levels .  
However , with growth of output in Africa projected to slow to about 2 per cent in 1999 below the level of population growth this modest recovery is already being threatened by international financial crises , declining commodity prices and regional conflicts .  
As noted in document E / CN . 5 / 1999 / 4 , although the multilateral financial institutions have acknowledged the importance of protecting or compensating the poor for the adverse effects of adjustment measures , the poor nevertheless continue to bear the brunt of hardships arising from macroeconomic and structural adjustment .  
In the face of acute budgetary constraints in many developing countries and transition economies , intensified by the worldwide financial crisis , efforts to improve financing of the social sector must be seen in the perspective of a host of competing claims upon national treasuries . 
The Commission also underscored that enhanced financing of social development requires a strong political commitment by the international community , as well as well focused efforts to mobilize human and financial resources .  
Aside from the mobilization of domestic and international financial resources , effective implementation must be based on comprehensive strategic thinking , including a clear identification of capacities and constraints at national and international levels .  
While a critical analysis of the contribution of the 20 / 20 initiative to the promotion of basic social services was urged , interested parties also underscored that the initiative leads to the combination of efforts of both donors and recipients of aid in a most visible way , matching domestic funds with an equal amount of foreign financial resources .  
Having committed themselves to a domestically based strategy to achieving more balanced growth , reducing imbalances and supporting recovery in emerging market economies , the Group also pledged strong cooperation to promote stability of the international monetary system and announced the launching of a financial stability forum to help avert future global crisis . 
Recent cases of international capital flight from developing countries , which have created tremendous strains and increased poverty , have been attributed in part to shortcomings in domestic policies and institutions , for example , but they can also be seen as symptomatic of an international financial system which fails to differentiate satisfactorily the performance of individual developing countries .  
The goal of the partnership , which consists of Governments , UNAIDS co-sponsoring agencies , bilateral organizations , non-governmental organizations and the private sector , is to mobilize Governments and organizations of civil society to redirect and expand national and international political , programme and financial commitments and action to address the epidemic and its impact on life and the potential for socio-economic development in Africa .  
The study found that while weak financial infrastructure , financial liberalization and speculation were to blame for the crisis , if reliable accounting information had been available , excessive financial exposure would have been detected earlier , permitting corrective action to be taken , and thus possibly diminishing the magnitude of the crisis .  
Advisory services to strengthen the technical capacity of over 50 developing countries and countries with economies in transition to record and monitor their external debt , including institutional legal and administrative issues , and training in the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System and debt management ; and on capital market development , financial risk management , greenhouse emissions trading , and clean development mechanism .  
Sudden inflows and equally sudden outflows of foreign capital create considerable difficulties for the management of domestic monetary policy ; 27 the resulting uncertainty and higher risks implied by financial volatility lead to caution on the part of Governments ( which tend to set interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been ) and of private business ( faced with increased costs of capital and increased uncertainty over future demand ) .  
More direct controls , such as those employed in Chile , would help to contain the disruptive effects of surges in short-term capital flows on economic growth , which if successful would actually make the environment more attractive for longer-term direct investment . 37 It should also be stressed that most transition economies possess extremely small financial sectors in relation to global capital flows , most of which come from the more advanced market economies . 
As the fallout from the initial financial crisis in Thailand enters its third year , weak international trade and the negligible improvement in private financial inflows mean that most developing and transition economies continue to face a tight external payments constraint .  
IS1.2 All revenue from staff assessment not otherwise disposed of by specific resolution of the General Assembly is credited to the Tax Equalization Fund established by the Assembly in its resolution 973 A ( X ) of 15 December 1955 .  Member States are given credit in that Fund in accordance with the scale of assessments for the regular budget applicable to the financial year concerned .  
Reaffirms the particular importance of the right of the child to education and the goals of Education for All , emphasizing the need for governments to broaden and constantly redefine the scope of basic education , including early childhood care and initial education , to develop a supporting policy context and to mobilize existing and new financial and human resources , including through concerted international action and cooperation ; 37 .  Calls upon States :  
Requests the Secretary _ General , the United Nations specialized agencies and the regional economic commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stresses that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions ;  
While the process of adapting from the television analog system to the digital standard has its financial implications in terms of capital investment in production equipment upgrade , the potential benefits for the effective dissemination of visual information are enormous .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have sufficient funds to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the latest episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation do deteriorate further , and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily _ indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Despite having adopted outward looking strategies and liberal market oriented policies for integration in the global economy , many of them are suffering economic setbacks as a result of the continuing turmoil in financial and currency markets .  
This was due to a combination of different factors including , inter alia , inadequate knowledge by national staff of financial management practices and of government and donor procedures as well as insufficient monitoring and supervision at the national level .  10 .  For the 87 programmes that were ongoing on 1 January 1999 , the total expenditure rates are generally higher the earlier the programme started , with some exceptions .  
In this context , the additional resources would enable the Secretary-General to make available an expanded range of programmes aimed at building and strengthening core organizational and managerial competencies ; to provide greater opportunities for staff at all levels to upgrade specific technical and substantive skills ; to support decentralization of human and financial resource management responsibilities and to strengthen career support mechanisms .  
The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section during previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
Requests the Secretary _ General , the United Nations specialized agencies and the regional economic commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stresses that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions ;  
Reaffirms the particular importance of the right of the child to education and the goals of Education for All , emphasizing the need for governments to broaden and constantly redefine the scope of basic education , including early childhood care and initial education , to develop a supporting policy context and to mobilize existing and new financial and human resources , including through concerted international action and cooperation ; 37 .  Calls upon States :  
There is , therefore , a need for the Council to consider arrangements to allow additional funding through either bilateral or multilateral sources , over and above those made under the programme , still subject to existing financial controls established by relevant decisions of the Council .  
Given earlier experiences with international initiatives regarding African diversification , it can be expected that this approach and the preparatory phase will provide a better and more substantive base for the generation of financial and technical support , and equip the entrepreneurs in closing the connectivity gap that exists between them and the world markets .  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
The Commission expresses its profound concern over the grave situation of attacks against human rights defenders and deplores the lack of effective judicial investigations into such crimes as well as the absence of effective legal , administrative , security and financial measures to protect those social and human rights defenders who find themselves at risk .  
The Trust Fund so established is open to voluntary financial contributions from States , inter-governmental organizations , regional economic integration organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations as well as natural and juridical persons .  
Calling for common action to tackle development challenges arising from globalization and the adverse effects of the financial crisis , ACC members committed themselves to working together to monitor the impact of the crisis on societies and individuals , help individual countries carry out the necessary structural and institutional reforms , and strengthen or build basic social services , livelihood opportunities and safety nets for the least fortunate .  
In its resolution S-20 / 4 , entitled Measures to enhance international cooperation to counter the world drug problem , the Assembly set out specific actions to be taken by Member States and by UNDCP and called for UNDCP to play a catalytic role in mobilizing international financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , United Nations organizations and the private sector for work on the drug problem and for assisting interested Governments .  
Seen in relation to the total annual appropriations for ESA programmes and other national programmes , the financial leeway for full implementation of a revised space policywith respect to previous commitments to such programmesis relatively limited , at least in the short term .  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Transitional Administration and the Support Group , they shall be credited their respective share of the remaining unencumbered balance of 14,646,100 dollars gross ( 13,906,700 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1998 ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the Civilian Police Support Group until payment is effected .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , they shall be credited their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars ;  
Decides also that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , their share in the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars shall be set off against their outstanding obligations ;  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph ( b ) above , their respective share of an equivalent amount of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 ;  
Decides also that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be credited their respective share in the remaining portion of the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 after the application of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) as provided for in paragraph ( d ) above , that is , 760,075 dollars gross ( 532,675 dollars net ) ;  
While noting that the lack of financial resources due to the prevailing economic crisis in Solomon Islands leaves little scope to the State party for providing adequate educational services , the Committee nevertheless is concerned about the absence of compulsory primary education in Solomon Islands , with merely 60 per cent of school age children having access to primary education .  
Once a junior company has identified a commercial deposit and carried out initial development work , the deposit is usually sold to larger corporations with better financial and technical resources .  
Encouraging longer-term capital flows to a large number of developing countries to support development objectives with the ultimate goal of the eradication of absolute poverty , mainly through improved access to productive employment and basic services , and integrating the social dimensions of development into policy objectives in the new international financial architecture .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
It was stated that for national machineries to be effective , clear mandates , location at the highest possible level , accountability mechanisms , partnership with civil society , a transparent political process , adequate financial and human resources , and continued strong political commitment were crucial .  
Reaffirmation of the importance attached to the work of IAEA regarding multilateral technical cooperation in the development of the applications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and call again for every effort to be made to ensure that IAEA has the necessary financial and human resources to meet its responsibilities in the area of technical cooperation , safeguards and nuclear safety .

While recent steps taken by some international financial institutions , including the World Bank , have aimed at better integration of social concerns into the design of structural adjustment programmes , the International Monetary Fund has sometimes given inadequate attention to protecting public spending even for essential social services .  
Mr . Al-Kidwa ( Observer for Palestine ) said that , in the decades since its establishment , UNRWA had played a crucial and historical role in halting the further deterioration of the situation of Palestine refugees and had greatly assisted them by providing the necessary relief , health care , education and social services .  The severe financial difficulties faced by the Agency were of grave concern .  
It was imperative that the international community , especially the major donors , whether they were States or financial institutions , should not abandon the Palestinian people in such a difficult economic , political and social situation .  
An increased dialogue among the governing bodies is in response to the need for high-level discussions on policies at the national and global levels , development cooperation , and commitment to issues of common concern such as poverty , financial stability and economic and social sustainability .  
Firm-level technological development depends on external factors such as interaction with the local economic environment , which provides the human and financial resources needed for the cultivation of internal capability and essential services such as standard setting , testing , basic R &amp; amp ; D and other forms of institutional support that enable firms to conduct in-house technical work effectively . 
Lastly , the two parties expressed satisfaction that the negotiation and signature of important draft agreements on tourism , cooperation in combating illicit traffic and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , and cooperation and mutual assistance in combating illegal financial operations had reached an advanced stage .  
Enhancing coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development and avoidance of international financial crisis and excessive financial volatility , and enhancing effective participation and integration of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the global economic system , including through capacity-building ;  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its decision 1996 / 114 , mindful of the need for and merit of having a consolidated set of the rules of procedure that are fully applicable to it , decided to entrust Mr . Ribot Hatano with the task of preparing , without financial implications , a working paper relating to the methods of work of the Sub _ Commission , to be submitted to it at its forty _ ninth session as a basis for discussion , which would contain :  
In the same resolution , the Commission on Human Rights requested the Secretary-General , the United Nations specialized agencies and the regional commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stressed that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , they shall be credited their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars ;  
Decides also that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , their share in the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars shall be set off against their outstanding obligations ;  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph ( b ) above , their respective share of an equivalent amount of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 ;  
Decides also that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be credited their respective share in the remaining portion of the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 after the application of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) as provided for in paragraph ( d ) above , that is , 760,075 dollars gross ( 532,675 dollars net ) ;  
Finally , some delegations pointed out that the main constraints to the effective and expanded application of TCDC / ECDC remain the lack of clearly defined national TCDC policies , insufficient awareness of TCDC 's full potential and importance , and inadequate provision of human and financial resources for TCDC .  
Among the attractions for offshore companies are the use of the United States dollar as the official currency , the absence of direct taxation , a growing financial infrastructure , fast and straightforward company registration procedures , extensive financial freedom and confidentiality .  
The CANZ delegations would have expected any questions surrounding such material amounts to have been settled and appropriate adjustments made to the financial statements before the accounts were submitted to Member States : the problem of unliquidated obligations was not new , had been the subject of critical comment by the Board of Auditors and the Advisory Committee in the past and had a direct impact on the funds due to Member States whether as troop contributors or as recipients of credits .  
Results confirm that despite continuing challenges , progress has been made by UNAIDS and its co-sponsors at the country level and that the theme groups on HIV / AIDS provide an effective way of coordinating financial and technical support to the national response to AIDS , encouraging teamwork and providing a forum for advocacy and interaction with bilateral agencies , non-governmental organizations and people living with HIV / AIDS .  
Affirming that , in paragraphs 13 and 14 of the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements5 it was recognized , inter alia , that the Habitat Agenda could only be effectively implemented if the role and functions of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) were strengthened and adequate financial resources , including new and additional resources from all sources , were mobilized at the national and international levels ,  
In addition , many delegations expressed support for the new strategic focus on security of tenure and urban governance and voiced the hope that the revitalization of the Centre would facilitate attainment of an adequate and predictable financial base .  
A focused , transparent and accountable Centre was also worthy of support and commitment from Member States , and he urged the Commission at its current session to send a positive financial signal in that regard , otherwise some very difficult decisions would have to be made .  
Finally , some delegations pointed out that the main constraints to the effective and expanded application of TCDC / ECDC remain the lack of clearly defined national TCDC policies , insufficient awareness of TCDC 's full potential and importance , and inadequate provision of human and financial resources for TCDC .  
Within its analytical activities regarding the main trends in world economy and the challenges and opportunities derived from them , ECLAC paid a great deal of attention to the repercussions of the international financial crisis .  A report on the impact of the Asian crisis on Latin America , which provided an extensive analysis of the medium and long-term impact of the crisis and policy - making recommendations , was presented to the Commission at its twenty-seventh session .  
The first took a new approach to the subject and included detailed analysis of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) corporate strategies of major investors , and paid special attention to regional investment abroad ; the second emphasized the positive effects that the global financial crisis has had on FDI in the region . 
A number of constraints militating against the successful implementation of the recommendations of the Conference were also identified , including economic and financial constraints ; technical and institutional limitations ; poorly coordinated actions among government departments , NGOs , civil society , the private sector and external partners ; and inadequate political will related to the use of available human and institutional capacity .  
The financial sector reforms , which included closure of institutions , more stringent capital adequacy requirements and larger provision for loan losses coupled with tight monetary policies , led to sharply higher interest rates and severely constrained access to credit . 
The impact came about through three main channels : ( a ) financial ( speculation against exchange rates , fall in the prices on regional stock markets and decline of capital inflows except at very high prices ) ; ( b ) trade ( deterioration of export prices , fall in the volume of exports and some problems of competition with Asian exporters ) ; and ( c ) policy measures by regional Governments to deal with problems resulting from the other two channels ( tight fiscal and monetary stance ) .  
The stabilization and adjustment measures implemented in many developing countries in different regions since the 1980s and more recently the financial crisis have drawn attention to the need to institute social safety net programmes in order to mitigate the short - and medium-term impact of the economic measures on the disadvantaged segment of the population .  
Requests the least developed countries bilateral , regional and multilateral development partners , in particular the European Union , the host of the Conference , and the United Nations Development Programme , to provide adequate technical and financial assistance to least developed countries to ensure a substantive and effective preparatory process for the Conference at the country level ;  
Integrate inland water transport within intermodal transport systems to provide door-to-door services for the movement of domestic and international traffic , thereby responding to market demand for convenient and competitive service while optimizing the economic , financial , environmental and social benefits that can be derived from each mode in the entire transport chain ;  
Accord appropriate priority to inland water transport in policy , planning and investment based on detailed analysis of the economic , financial , social and environmental benefits , and to promote public awareness of such benefits , thereby encouraging a modal shift to inland water transport , where appropriate ;  
Continue to undertake detailed analyses of the financial and economic crisis , paying particular attention to the role of financial markets , and to present options to members and associate members which they may use , as appropriate , as inputs in the formulation of their relevant national policies , with a view to ensuring the attraction of a steady inflow of private capital ;  
In the statement , the Ministers agreed that one of the key lessons for Africa of the current crisis is the need to strengthen supervisory and regulatory mechanisms to ensure transparency in financial transaction and improve corporate governance , in consonance with the principles of financial liberalization and the development of financial and capital markets .  
They welcomed the formation , at the initiative of the Group of Seven ( G-7 ) major industrialized countries , of an ad hoc intergovernmental working group to address issues relating to the proposed reform of the international financial and monetary system , and stressed the importance of adequate African representation in this group or any other group set up for a similar purpose .  
Having reviewed and shared experiences with tax reforms in their various countries , the Ministers agreed to reinforce macroeconomic stability and deepen financial market and institutional reforms , as well as to ensure sound interest and exchange-rate policy management so as to enhance private and public savings .  
They resolved to take the necessary steps to stem and reverse capital flight , focusing on policies that create and sustain a consistent and stable macroeconomic policy environment , and promoting capital and financial markets development , as well as resolving the problem of unsustainably high external debts .  
The discussion focused on six main subjects : measures to promote recovery and sustained economic growth ; financial architecture and financial flows for development ; increasing participation and cross-sectoral coherence ; international policy on external debt ; economic crisis and social policy initiatives ; and further cooperation between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions .  
In the view of several Ministers , efforts were necessary to stabilize State revenue by means of a fair system of taxation and efficient tax administration , and to mobilize more domestic capital through an effective private sector financial system subject to adequate bank supervision .  
Also , fundamental institutional safeguards were needed rules on competition , transparency , rule of law , democratic control of the State , core labour standards , a public spending structure that made adequate provision for the poor , in particular by means of social investments and a safety net to ensure that international or national financial resources had a positive impact on development .  
Several Ministers stated that , while developing countries were generally encouraged by recent broad proposals on functioning of international financial markets and financing for development , they were concerned about the design of the initiatives to give effect to such proposals .  
In connection with regulation 2 , some delegations were of the view that the biennial financial period should not start in 2002 , since budgetary requirements to be estimated in advance of a biennial period could only be based on stable and foreseeable expenditure patterns and the Meeting did not yet have sufficient information to foresee the developments in relation to the Tribunal 's expenditures .  
With regard to the retroactive implementation of the reformed procedures for determining reimbursement to Member States for contingent-owned equipment , while the issues which had been raised by the Board of Auditors deserved further scrutiny , the problems were mainly transitional and a comparative study on the financial implications would serve no useful purpose .  
The studies carried out in those areas have all contributed to a better understanding of the real conditions prevailing in the country and have led to the adoption of better focused development plans and strategies , which in turn have improved the management of physical , human and financial resources and have guaranteed their rational use , while also yielding a corresponding increase in productivity .  
The Group of Experts observed that in the context of the evolving international economic environment and globalization , it has become necessary to explore ways and means , particularly in the international taxation area , to provide an enabling environment for expansion of international trade and capital movements across national boundaries to promote financial resource mobilization for the achievement of sustainable economic growth .  
The agenda for the ninth meeting was based on the discussions during the eighth meeting of the Group of Experts and on important issues in international taxation in the context of prevailing international economic , fiscal and financial environment .  
The Group of Experts was aware that an efficient and effective revenue administration can help developing countries and transitional economies to mobilize additional revenue resources and achieve greater financial self-reliance in facilitating and achieving sustainable economic development .  
Banking and financial institutions , international technical assistance organizations and the specialized abilities of various United Nations agencies all have a role to play in ensuring that human , technical and material resources are wisely directed to sustained programmes of applied disaster mitigation practices .  
While there is expected to be a further narrowing of interest-rate spreads in 2000 , any major perturbation in financial markets of developed countries , such as marked corrections in stock markets or significant increases in interest rates , could adversely affect investor sentiment towards emerging markets .  
Progress in domestic economic reforms , though varying from country to country , and the improved international environment , notably less unfavourable commodity prices and more stable global financial markets , have been instrumental in improving the outlook .  
There are various reasons for this : the lagged growth cycle in many emerging market economies ; the former high levels of interest rates in some of these countries , especially in real terms ; the greater , though still limited , degree of independence gained for monetary policy in the many countries that have embraced floating exchange-rate regimes ; and the improved international and domestic financial conditions in many countries . 
The internationalization of the economy of the United States as well as of that of most countries as a result of improved communications , declining transport costs , trade liberalization , and global financial integration has stimulated a wide range of economic activities and changed the international division of labour in many industries . 
They also have to overcome such institutional constraints as less liquid and deep financial markets , less developed venture capital networks , less flexible corporate structures and a higher degree of government regulation in certain areas ( such as telecommunications ) . 
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating year 2000 issues in the areas of information management , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management , as well as legal , financial and administrative issues .  
The costs of establishing and maintaining an efficient transit transport system are often so high that landlocked and transit developing countries can not accomplish this formidable task without adequate support from the international donor community in the shape of advisory and technical services and financial resources .  
Although most international financial and economic organizations do not have specifically tailored programmes to address the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries as a category , most of these countries are eligible for soft window facilities as they are amongst the poorest .  
We welcome the progress made through the chairmanship of the European Commission and the World Bank towards establishing a donor coordination process to develop a coherent international assistance strategy for the region , opening the door for all donor opportunities , as well as to mobilize additional financial support for reconstruction , regional integration , economic recovery and reform and to promote sound macroeconomic and structural policies by the countries concerned .  
In order to examine one specific set of these downside risks , a study was undertaken , utilizing the models of Project LINK , of the possible impact on the world economy of another major financial crisis , on this occasion entailing a sizeable stock market correction and credit rationing , with currency realignments and shrinkage in international capital flows .  
In this era of heightened financial volatility , the importance of sound macroeconomic fundamentals has become paramount : a sustainable fiscal position and current-account balance , a low or moderate rate of inflation , and consistency between the rate of inflation and the exchange rate are indispensable for any economy , as all economies are open ( albeit to different degrees ) .  
It is now increasingly recognized that the response to crises has to address the domestic social consequences of any economic measures that are adopted and should not be restricted to restoring macroeconomic stability and international financial confidence .  
The main features of globalization have been an increasing reliance on a deregulated global market , maximally free trade , uncontrolled flow of investment , and the paramount role of the international financial market , with the IMF and the World Bank moving to the centre stage of world power .  
Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , with the assistance of the international community , especially donors , including through bilateral and / or multilateral financial support , should ensure that social safety nets are implemented , especially in those countries most affected by the recent global financial crisis , and ensure that they are adequately funded .  
Governments should improve the management and delivery of services for the growing urban agglomerations and put in place enabling legislative and administrative instruments and adequate financial resources to meet the needs of all citizens , especially the urban poor , internal migrants , older persons and the disabled .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems . 72 bis .  
Although we fully acknowledge the importance of reproductive health programmes , their implementation still requires enormous financial and technical assistance by the international community to complement the efforts made in this regard by developing countries , and the least developed in particular , since they can not meet these demands .  
Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , with the assistance of the international community , especially donors , including through bilateral and / or multilateral financial support , should ensure that social safety nets are implemented , especially in those countries most affected by the recent global financial crisis , and ensure that they are adequately funded .  
Governments should improve the management and delivery of services for the growing urban agglomerations and put in place enabling legislative and administrative instruments and adequate financial resources to meet the needs of all citizens , especially the urban poor , internal migrants , older persons and the disabled .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
Whatever the relevance of these measures , it is important to stress that positive results objectives such as improving the living conditions of our peoples and the elimination of poverty in developing countries in general and in African countries in particular can be achieved only if there is an increased mobilization of international financial resources and a substantial alleviation of the crushing debt burden on those countries .  
Since the developing countries constitute the majority of the world population , the successful implementation of the international Programme of Action is quite inconceivable if these serious economic and financial difficulties are not overcome and if the international environment , unfavourable for developing countries , is not rectified .  
This calls for new and additional resources from donor countries and international financial institutions to complement national efforts and resources for the further implementation of the noble principles of the ICPD Programme of Action and to reverse the current decline in overall official development assistance .  
First , political will for the advancement of the Cairo commitments in many developing countries has been weakened by the recent financial crisis and continued economic stagnation , as well as by frequently recurring natural disasters .  
Achieving the multiplicity of goals set at various conferences such as Agenda 21 , the Barbados Programme of Action for Small Island Developing States and the Cairo Programme of Action is not easy , but we can fully realize that objective if the international community , international financial institutions , the private sector , non-governmental organizations and national Governments together make a firm and collaborative commitment to such a worthy undertaking .  
Comparisons with other regulatory mechanisms for analogous markets ( such as the transport of toxic wastes and hazardous products , the regulation of securities and financial markets and institutions , the marking and tracing of weapons and other commercial goods , and treaty instruments containing provisions for judicial cooperation or extraterritorial jurisdiction ) should also be examined .  
The buyer was entitled to regard the bringing forward of the delivery date to late August merely as a reciprocal concession for a financial advantage and could not be expected to have understood that a few days delay in taking delivery would constitute a fundamental breach on its part .  
The sheer magnitude of the post-Cold War problems , the levels of national and regional insecurity they generate and State reluctance to continue to meet what are seen as the rising financial , political , environmental and social costs of maintaining large refugee populations , or receiving a continuous flow has had a marked and negative impact on the willingness of countries to provide asylum .  
In the interest of prudent financial management , up to half of the value of conditional pledges from governments and firm pledges made by organisations of established repute are recognised as income at the time the pledge is received .  
Liabilities for the payment of unused accrued annual leave ( maximum of 60 days ) and the payment of repatriation grants and related expenditures for relocation upon separation from the Organization based on the number of years of service , need to be valuated and the disclosure will be incorporated in the Notes to the Financial Statements for subsequent financial periods .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
It also assumes that international financial institutions and bilateral donors would demonstrate greater flexibility in the granting of loans to countries emerging from conflicts , where the entire administrative , economic and social infrastructures have very often been destroyed .  
Decides further that Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Transitional Administration and the Support Group shall be credited their respective share of the remaining unencumbered balance of 14,646,100 dollars gross ( 13,906,700 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1998 ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the Civilian Police Support Group until payment is effected .  
As an urgent priority , UNMIK will thoroughly assess the existing legal , financial , and fiscal structure and capacities in order to put in place policies for the recovery , development and future integration of Kosovo into a healthy and expanding regional economy in Southeastern Europe .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session containing a comprehensive analysis of the organizational structure and technical , personnel and financial resources of the Non-Governmental Organizations Section , commensurate with the increased workload and the level of responsibility , necessary to implement the Secretariats mandate , as contained in Council resolution 1996 / 31 , parts 10 and 11 ;  
The Directors stressed that the successful implementation of the financial programme , including the clearance of external and domestic arrears , would hinge crucially on a sustained increase in budget revenue and the timely implementation of agreed measures .  
The work of UNRWA continued to be affected by the continuing financial crisis that the Agency has faced since 1993 as a result of repeated shortfalls in funding for the regular budget combined with increasing refugee needs .  
The Special Representative of the Secretary-General does not and can not enjoy the powers to decide at his own discretion the validity of Yugoslav laws in Kosovo and Metohija , because it is an integral part of the constitutional , legal , economic , financial , fiscal , monetary , foreign currency , customs , transport and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and those of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
In view of these circumstances , and seeking to gather more information on all aspects of the question of remote interpretation in the technical , financial and human resources fields , it has been provisionally decided to organize another experiment , as comprehensive as the one conducted earlier this year , but now entailing the servicing from Geneva of a two-week meeting to be held at Nairobi as early as possible in 2000 .  
The Commission had subsequently identified four areas for future analytical work and expert meetings : ( a ) the respective roles of government and the private sector and the interactions between them in SME development ; ( b ) inter-firm cooperation ; ( c ) SME clustering and networking ; and ( d ) the provision of sustainable financial and non-financial services for SME development .  
Governments should create an enabling environment for SMEs through stable macroeconomic policies and an open and flexible regulatory framework in order to stimulate free competition , research and development , and to create neutral conditions that fostered entrepreneurial activity , developed competitive advantages and created access to both national and foreign financial resources and new technologies .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
The Council reiterates the importance of a stable and predictable political and economic environment for local and foreign investment and other international financial flows , which remain essential for Africa 's economic and social development .  
The difficulties faced by SMEs in accessing financial services included the perceived high risks for lenders ; high transaction costs due to the absence of effective methodologies of risk assessment ; the lack of adequate information , such as accounting records and other financial documentation , from the SMEs themselves ; and lenders ' bias in favour of large corporate borrowers .  
By contributing to the Fund , States demonstrate their commitment to combating torture and their solidarity with the victims , enabling the latter to receive medical , psychological , psychiatric , financial , social , legal or humanitarian assistance and to resume a normal life . 
The programme that the independent expert is proposing in this paper would be based on international cooperation , in the form of a compact between the donor countries of the OECD , the financial institutions and the concerned developing countries , to realize three basic rights - the right to food , the right to primary health care and the right to primary education - within a specified time period .  
But the international community might like to decide to adopt a few specific international programmes to begin implementing the right to development as compacts between developed and developing countries which would take on the obligations of following policies and procedures mutually agreed upon and of providing required financial and other assistance as identified .  
Security Council resolution 1244 ( 1999 ) clearly defined the framework for the international civil and security presences in Kosovo and Metohija , which constitutes an integral part of the unified constitutional , legal , economic , financial , monetary , customs and tax systems of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Kosovo and Metohija is an autonomous province and constitutes an integral part of the single constitutional , legal , economic , financial , monetary , fiscal , foreign exchange , customs , traffic and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Some of the speakers saw an increase in public awareness about space activities and the benefits of exploring outer space as a major need and considered that such awareness would help garner the political and financial support for major national and international programmes .  
Wide-ranging applications being planned include distance learning , corporate training , collaborative work groups , telecommuting , telemedicine , electronic commerce , direct-to-home video and satellite news-gathering , as well as the distribution of music , software , scientific data and global financial and weather information .  
The experience of developing countries during the past several years has also demonstrated that financial crises are contagious ; that is , once difficulties emerge , markets do not adequately discriminate between countries with strong and weak fundamentals , or between those with strong and weak economic structures and macroeconomic management . 
Finally , recent experience has demonstrated a fundamental problem of the global economy , namely the enormous discrepancy that exists between an increasingly sophisticated and dynamic international financial world , with rapid globalization of financial portfolios , and the lack of a proper institutional framework to manage it .  
The rapid globalization of capital markets during the past two decades and the ability of a growing number of developing countries to tap those markets directly has been accompanied by the atrophy of official development assistance ( ODA ) and a significant slowing in the pace of lending by the multilateral financial institutions . 
International financial flows for development occur through borrowing abroad under commercial terms , through official development assistance , and through the regular lending activities of multilateral lending institutions , which borrow funds in international capital markets and lend the proceeds to developing countries . 
The rapid liberalization of financial transactions in developing countries without sufficient prudential regulation was an important element in the onset of the current financial and economic crisis .  
These regimes seek to strike an acceptable balance between the need for intellectual property owners to secure an appropriate rate of financial return on their investment in knowledge , and the larger social benefits that would flow from rapid and unrestricted knowledge flows .  
While the Committee is aware of the efforts undertaken by the State party to allocate substantial financial resources for the benefit of children , it reiterates its concern ( see CRC / C / 15 / Add . 24 , para . 8 ) that stringent budgetary measures and external debt , as well as the persistence of widespread poverty and uneven income distribution , are still having a negative impact on the situation of children in the State party .  
While the Committee is aware that the full implementation of the new juvenile justice system requires substantial financial and human resources as well as the development of infrastructure , as established in the document entitled Transformation and investment in the human rights of children and adolescents ( May 1999 ) , it remains concerned that the juvenile justice system is not fully implemented .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
The Secretariat should note in particular the clear and unambiguous language of paragraphs 3 and 9 of the draft resolution , which emphasized that all future and existing peacekeeping missions should be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements and that no peacekeeping mission should be financed by borrowing funds from other active peacekeeping missions .  
The increased political and financial support to UPE is a promising sign of greater international and domestic attention to creating a basis for effective recognition of the right to education .  
While the previous decades left a negative heritage , as is summarized below , the political and financial commitment to investment in education that led to UPE in 1997 promises to remedy the inherited dissociation between political and economic governance and open the way towards defining the right to education within Ugandas specific international and domestic environment .  
[ Globalization and in particular financial liberalization , the extent of resources controlled by the private sector and corporate strategies for investment have at the same time far / Globalization greatly increased trade and capital flows , opens new opportunities for sustained economic growth and development of the world economy and also permits countries to share experiences and to learn from one anothers achievements and difficulties .  
Promoting South-South cooperation , particularly in terms of economic and technical cooperation , and supporting a triangular mechanism whereby donor countries would provide [ financial / appropriate United States ] support for South-South cooperation ; considering the establishment of a generalized trust fund [ supported by voluntary contributions United States ] for triangular economic technical cooperation among developing countries .  
The eventual abandonment of this regime in favour of an independent Palestinian currency would be a natural conclusion of the transitional process , during which credibility is established , institutions are built up and financial markets mature .  
Effective integration into international capital markets requires a deepening of domestic capital markets by increasing domestic savings and developing a strong domestic institutional investor base on the one hand , and by strengthening the prudential supervision of financial markets , together with sound and efficient banking systems , on the other .  
Resulting exchange rate appreciation and abrupt compensatory movements in fiscal and monetary policies that accentuate the cyclical movements of foreign capital can entail high development costs , especially if domestic financial systems are weak and not well regulated and supervised .  
The BSEC Charters preamble reaffirms the common will of its member States to adhere to the principles of the United Nations Charter and share the vision of their regional cooperation as part of the integration process in Europe , based on human rights and fundamental freedoms , prosperity through economic liberty , social justice , and equal security and stability , which is open for interaction with other countries , regional initiatives and international organizations and financial institutions .  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating Y2K issues in the areas of information technology , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management and legal , financial and administrative issues . 
It has also contributed actively to a number of international and regional funds established to promote economic and social development in various countries of the world , including the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development , the Islamic Development Bank and other financial and economic institutions established for that purpose , and which the State of Kuwait is diligently supporting so that they can achieve the noble , humanitarian aims for which they were established . 
There is also concern that the recent emphasis in financial and economic policies has not always been development-oriented , that the dominance of a limited set of macroeconomic targets and parameters over the social , political , cultural and environmental domains has gone too far , and that social and economic policies and objectives must be fully integrated .  
Finally , the Council agreed that the international community has a key role to play in supporting efforts to eradicate poverty , promote productive employment and achieve gender equality , and that the mobilization of new and additional financial resources from all sources , national and international , is required .  
Call on the international community to provide effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , in accordance with chapter 33 of Agenda 21 , to support small island developing States [ , in particular the least developed amongst them ] in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ;  
The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels , including the international level , to strengthen support , including financial support from all sources , to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity-building and institutional building , facilitating the access of small island developing States to and transfer and use of environmentally sound technology , as set forth in the Programme of Action .  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
Building on the recent small island developing States donors meeting , with special consideration from the international community for new and additional financial commitments and disbursements of resources , as well as better and more efficient use of ODA and other existing external sources of finance , taking into account the specific development needs and priorities of small island developing States ;  
The second module , which is under development , will assess specific skills and abilities within occupational groups keyed to functional requirements ( administrative , financial , logistical , electoral etc . ) .  
This implies the full respect of the unified legal , economic , financial ( the dinar as the sole legal tender ) , tax , visa and passport systems and observance of the laws of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that are in force , in particular those relating to property , legal and status and administrative matters , registry of citizens and issuance of personal identification documents , passports and other identity papers .  
The Commission had subsequently identified four areas for future analytical work and expert meetings : ( a ) the respective roles of government and the private sector and the interactions between them in SME development ; ( b ) inter-firm cooperation ; ( c ) SME clustering and networking ; and ( d ) the provision of sustainable financial and non-financial services for SME development .  
Governments should create an enabling environment for SMEs through stable macroeconomic policies and an open and flexible regulatory framework in order to stimulate free competition , research and development , and to create neutral conditions that fostered entrepreneurial activity , developed competitive advantages and created access to both national and foreign financial resources and new technologies .  
" 17 .  UNCTAD , in cooperation with other relevant international organizations and within existing human and financial resources , should seek to assist developing countries , upon request , in understanding the implications of various legislative approaches to accommodating electronic commerce ; "  
The United States , which has continued to apply laws and measures affecting the sovereignty and legitimate interests of other States and freedom of trade and navigation , as well as inflicting tremendous pain on the Cuban people , should , in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and relevant resolutions of the United Nations , put an end to the economic , commercial and financial embargo that it has imposed on Cuba .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that while the international community is directing its efforts towards resolving tensions and the further promotion and expansion of commercial relations at global level , the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba has caused the Cuban people serious suffering and also created difficulties in global commercial and financial relations .  
That the United States of America continues to ignore the will of the international community , as embodied in the successive resolutions adopted by the General Assembly with a view to lifting the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba , is to be regarded as a flagrant violation of the principles and norms of international law and of the Charter of the United Nations .  
The policies and laws of economic , commercial and financial blockade and embargo of the United States of America imposed on the Republic of Cuba in the last decades violate the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and run counter to the common trends of our world today , namely cooperation for development on the basis of equality amongst sovereign States and non-discrimination of political systems .  
Similarly , the creation and establishment of a balanced human rights programme and the need to allocate adequate human and financial resources to capacity building , the right to development , economic , social and cultural rights , technical cooperation etc . , are also missing from the report .  Alternative recommendation 2 : To include the establishment of a balanced human rights programme on the agenda of the working group referred to above .  
Uncertainty about future developments in the international economy has grown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , which demonstrated the volatility of international private capital flows and its damaging effects on levels of economic activity and peoples livelihoods in developing countries .  
Such legislative , regulatory or administrative measures could include the use of authenticated end-user certificates , enhanced legal and enforcement measures , as appropriate , to control arms-brokering activities , requirements to ensure that no retransfer of small arms and light weapons takes place without prior authorization of the original supplier State , and cooperation in the exchange of information on suspect financial activities .  
Among the recent measures reported by Governments to underline the priority assigned to improving the financial situation of families are : expanding a cash support system for families with young children ( Norway ) ; initiating a national social security savings scheme ( Singapore ) ; initiating a Family Support Trust Fund ( Cyprus ) ; initiating child relief and tax rebates for the first to fourth child ( Singapore ) ; and providing welfare benefits for the elderly ( Thailand ) .  
The five basic commonly cited obstacles the global economic situation ; limited financial resources ; the lack of trained personnel ; insufficient inter-institutional coordination ; and the paucity of basic data and comparative research may be described as follows :  
Any decision on the venue of the international conference on the illicit arms trade must take into account the need to ensure the most advantageous financial conditions for the participants in the conference ; a broad geographical spectrum of participating countries ; maximum effectiveness of the work of the conference ; and the necessary security guarantees for delegations .  
Moreover , the joint UNDP / UNCTAD Programme on Globalization , Liberalization and Sustainable Human Development , which was initiated in 1998 , supports the development of a conceptual and analytical framework articulating globalization and sustainable human development and the strengthening of the negotiation capacities of poor countries , to enable them to participate better in the negotiations of multilateral trade , investment and financial agreements .  
The meeting requested least developed countries development partners , both bilateral and multilateral , to provide adequate financial and technical resource to the Conference secretariat to ensure an efficient and effective preparatory process .  
The ninth G15 summit , held in Montego Bay , Jamaica , in February 1999 , had emphasized the need to find appropriate solutions to the financial crisis , which had had widespread negative economic and social consequences and had increased unemployment and poverty .  
In addition , the office would manage any new United Nations civilian mission , facilitate continuing dialogue among key actors in Haiti and the international community , support the democratization process , help to mobilize international political and financial support for Haiti and provide the political framework and focal point for integrating and coordinating the activities of the international community .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance to landlocked developing countries be extended on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and substantially increased .  
Her delegation was disappointed that the " Issues for consideration " document provided few pragmatic and concrete recommendations on the role that international cooperation could play in building up physical infrastructure in the transport sector , and no concrete suggestion had been put forward on how to strengthen and improve international cooperation , particularly in improving financial resource availability for transport infrastructure development .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
Yet , as world trade , investment and financial flows continue to expand at a remarkable pace , so has the need for establishing integrated , flexible , fast , cost-effective and environmentally sound national and international transport and communications become more pronounced .  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 3 of the report ( DP / 1999 / 40 ) and the interim financial statements for the year ended 31 December 1998 that UNOPS brought the level of its operational reserve from $ 17.6-million at 31 December 1997 to $ 19.9-million at 31 December 1998 , which is the approved level of 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the prior year ( $ 499.7-million ) in accordance with Executive Board decision 97 / 21 of 18 September 1997 .  
Among the substantive issues discussed , the following warrant special note : identification of the items to be considered ; how to ensure observance of existing international standards ; activities to be undertaken ; appraisal of progress achieved and obstacles met in eliminating racism ; measures for making United Nations mechanisms more effective ; and , lastly , proposals for securing the necessary human and financial resources .  
To achieve greater coherence in global economic policy-making , which is one of the functions of WTO , and make it more operational , WTO rules and disciplines should be taken fully into account by the international financial institutions when designing macroeconomic programmes and rescue packages for individual countries .  
The future of the University is strongly tied to the political and financial support reflected not only in greater numbers of Governments acceding to the International Agreement for the Establishment of the University for Peace but also in increasing contributions of financial resources for the normal functioning of the University and the launching of new programmes .  
According to the conclusions contained in the report , regional and international financial , technical and technological assistance in rebuilding infrastructure and administrative capacity and civil society , and in economic rehabilitation for the implementation of practical disarmament measures , should include the early involvement of international financial institutions .  
A policy framework that integrates macroeconomic , financial , structural , social and human issues is imperative if there is to be equitable and sustainable development .  
In designing and implementing the policy and programme options for improving the conditions of the poor in an increasingly global context , three factors are essential for success : good governance ; an efficient administrative and institutional support structure at both the national and local levels for the effective delivery and monitoring of social development programmes ; and adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors .  
The discussion focused on six main issues : measures to promote recovery and sustained economic growth ; financial architecture and financial flows for development ; increasing participation and cross-sectoral coherence ; international policy on external debt ; economic crisis and social policy initiative and further cooperation between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions .  
IMF policy advice , financial and technical assistance has sought to improve the quality of public expenditure by shifting resources away from unproductive outlays , such as excessive military expenditure , to infrastructure , basic education and health care , which build physical and human capital and thus enhance broad-based growth and equity , and to target poverty alleviation programmes .  
While mercenaries may be recruited , trained and financed from within solid , stable countries , they are in fact used chiefly in countries affected by political violence , internal armed conflict , insurrection or insurgency and lacking the necessary financial or technical capacity to exploit their natural resources on an industrial scale .  
Further , additional financial resources will be decentralized to country offices to provide greater flexibility in providing short advisory services to member States and to facilitate regular public and private sector policy dialogue .  
Member States are encouraged to continue supporting the efforts of the Office in this area and to provide additional financial resources as part of their contributions to the programme of advisory services and technical assistance in the field of human rights , to enable the Office to further extend its activities in support of Member States that request assistance in establishing national institutions and also to support such institutions in their work .  
We have heard a comprehensive report on the evolution of the United Nations role in decolonization ; we have received prescriptions for addressing this critical issue for our small island Territories in a new millennium ; and we have listened intently to the extensive dialogue on the impact of unilateral changes on the offshore financial sector of the Territories . 
It also requested all non-governmental organizations dealing with womens issues to devote some of their activities to the study of the various harmful traditional practices and ways of eradicating them and appealed to the international community to provide material , technical and financial support to non-governmental organizations and groups working to achieve the total elimination of such practices .  
Decides further that any exceptions to this rule may be made by the body concerned only if the statements are to serve as bases for discussion and if , after hearing a statement of the relevant financial implications , the body decides that one or more statements in extenso may be included in the summary record , or reproduced as separate documents or as annexes to authorized documents .  
Within its current severe financial and staffing constraints , the Institute has been able to implement a modest but promising substantive programme of work , thus demonstrating its institutional potential and proving its capability to fulfil its unique role in pursuit of the advancement of women and gender equality .  
Links are being forged or strengthened with international , regional and sub-regional organizations ; academic and other institutions ; international financial institutions ; the private sector ; members of civil society ; and even military organizations and police structures .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of the least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance be extended to them on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and increased substantially .

A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
Yet , as world trade , investment and financial flows continue to expand at a remarkable pace , so has the need for establishing integrated , flexible , fast , cost-effective and environmentally sound national and international transport , and communications become more pronounced .  
Decides further that any exceptions to this rule may be made by the body concerned only if the statements are to serve as bases for discussion and if , after hearing a statement of the relevant financial implications , the body decides that one or more statements in extenso may be included in the summary record , or reproduced as separate documents or as annexes to authorized documents .  
Policies for the prevention and the better management of financial crises have so far concentrated on particular areas , such as improved transparency , strengthened financial regulation , financial facilities better designed to support countries experiencing large capital outflows and currency collapses , and reduction of moral hazard problems in international lending and investment .  
It provides such channels as absence of currency controls at borders ; increased and instant capital flows at the international level , making it difficult to isolate suspicious transactions ; dollarization of economies , thereby facilitating the circulation of dirty cash ; and a multiplication of the development of offshore financial services to attract foreign investments .  
Combined efforts of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , should help countries to enhance the performance of macroeconomic management , achieve greater coherence in the policies affecting economic , financial , social and environmental aspects , and protect the most vulnerable groups , and thus give the concerned country an opportunity to use this support to further its national goals while integrating better into the global economy .  
The first is the pledge of $ 220-million for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance for Kosovo and neighbouring countries ; and the second is a pledge announced yesterday in Tokyo for a preliminary $ 2-million to meet immediate humanitarian needs for East Timor , to be followed by further assistance in response to any future appeal , as well as substantial financial contributions to the United Nations trust fund to support the multinational force established by the Security Council resolution . 
As 17 of the landlocked developing countries are also classified by the United Nations as least developed countries and most transit countries are themselves developing countries facing serious economic problems , including the lack of adequate infrastructure in the transport sector , donor countries and the financial and development institutions play a critical role in providing the financial and technical assistance required to improve transit systems .  
The costs of establishing and maintaining an efficient transit transport system are often so high that landlocked and transit developing countries can not accomplish this formidable task without support from the international donor community in the shape of advisory and technical services and financial resources .  
Although most international financial and economic organizations do not have specifically tailored programmes to address the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries as a category , most of these countries are eligible for soft window facilities as they are amongst the poorest countries .  
The awarding authority must , in each case , satisfy itself that the contract proposed has been examined and approved by the legal , financial and other officers as appropriate , that adequate tenders be requested , that , all other conditions being equal , the lowest price or bid be accepted and that the contract proposed is overall in accordance with the Agencys best interests .  
In its resolution 53 / 172 , the United Nations General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with financial crises , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups .  
Pursuant to this resolution , and with a view to contributing to the report which Secretary-General Kofi Annan is to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session , the High-Level Regional Meeting Towards a stable and predictable international financial system and its relationship to social development was held in Mexico City from 5 to 7 September 1999 at the initiative of the Mexican Government and with the support of ECLAC .  
One important and urgent challenge for the United Nations is that of including , as part of its activities in the economic , social and financial fields , the in-depth consideration of issues such as financial crisis prevention and management , issues pertaining to financing for development , the rules of access to multilateral resources and the role of regional institutions , while respecting the areas in which national autonomy must be preserved .  
Regarding the groups proposals on practical measures of assistance to third countries affected by sanctions , Belarus feels that the priority step might be to dispatch to the worst-affected third countries special representatives of the Secretary-General accompanied by special missions to elaborate recommendations for alleviating the economic , commercial , financial , social , humanitarian and environmental effects .  
However , some preliminary results seem to show that aid alone can play only a limited role with respect to the three categories of possible effects of sanctions on third States , i.e . economic , trade and financial effects ; social and humanitarian effects ; and secondary effects as indicated in the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting . 
Military service has been estimated to be more straining both physically and psychologically , the actual daily / weekly time of duty is longer , there are fewer financial benefits and freedom of movement and other aspects of personal freedom are more restricted .  
Decisions to recommend projects for support are considered by interdisciplinary review entities , at substantive , administrative and financial levels , and are based on the technical quality of the proposal , its relationship to national policies and the contribution that project results are expected to make to the further equalization of opportunities by , for and with persons with disabilities .  
Even though the primary responsibility of maintaining security and the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and areas always lies with the host State , the international community is duty bound to assist governments in this task and , above all , to bear the bulk of the costs to African States whose financial and logistic capacities are limited .  
Not only are the financial and material resources devoted by the international community and the international financial institutions to combat the real causes of conflicts in Africa completely inadequate , but there is also insufficient emergency financial aid being devoted to the needs of the African continent .  
The main functions of the Division will be to plan and monitor the economic and social reconstruction of East Timor , in close consultation with the East Timorese ; to prepare and evaluate policies and to set up institutions in the economic , social and financial fields ; and to coordinate with the various donors and international financial institutions the resource mobilization efforts of UNTAET .  
The major shortcomings of the initiative are derived from the complexity of the process itself , as well as the lack of adequate funding for an expeditious resolution of all eligible cases without damage to the financial standing of the public institutions to which the debt is owed .  
A favourable and enabling investment climate which mobilizes FDI and domestic savings and channels them into productive investments also requires that the suppliers of capital have reliable , transparent and comparable financial information .  
C In cooperation with other international and regional institutions , undertake technical assistance programmes on capital market development and other specific actions to strengthen the domestic financial infrastructure , with a view to assisting developing countries to mobilize stable sources of finance ;  
C Identifying policies to address major constraints faced by many developing countries in responding to environmental challenges , such as lack of technical , financial , institutional and supply capacities , taking into account the environmental and developmental conditions of each country ;  
Policy-oriented analytical work should be carried out by UNCTAD on : ( 1 ) the impact of electronic commerce on trade policies ; ( 2 ) the fiscal and financial implications of electronic commerce ; ( 3 ) the implications for developing countries of the legal and regulatory aspects of electronic commerce ; and ( 4 ) the impact of electronic commerce on employment , productivity and economic growth .  
UNDCP is playing a catalytic role in providing the strategy for achieving this goal , in close cooperation with national and international partners and international financial institutions engaged in poverty eradication , health and education to improve the overall quality of life in areas affected by illicit cultivation of narcotic crops , thereby reducing incentives for the cultivation of illicit crops .  
Finally , UNDCP was requested to provide requesting Governments with the technical assistance that they required and to take steps to mobilize international logistical and financial support with a view to establishing national mechanisms for monitoring and verifying the cultivation of illicit crops used in the production of drugs and developing an international network for the control of illicit cultivation for the purpose of implementing the Action Plan .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 , 50 / 10 , 51 / 17 , 52 / 10 and 53 / 4 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
Notes the importance of joint efforts to overcome the constraints in implementing the Programme of Action , by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , deeper involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , and availability of financial resources ;  
While its close-knit families and strong agricultural base had enabled Thailand to weather the 1997 financial crisis , the existing social safety nets had been severely tested and the crisis had served as a reminder that social development could not be treated as secondary to economic development .  
Since ideology and determination alone could not secure social development in developing countries , there must be an effort during the special session to strengthen international partnerships with a view to mobilizing the necessary financial assistance , technical know-how and human resources .  
The main features of the Governments policy concerning persons with disabilities were to safeguard equal rights and provide equal opportunities ; promote full and equal participation by disabled persons in the social and economic life of the country , deinstitutionalize disabled persons and promote independent living ; and provide financial assistance to organizations of the disabled .  
Services were provided in medical rehabilitation ; education ; training and retraining ; vocational assessment and guidance ; placement in employment in the open market , sheltered employment , self-employment and supported employment ; provision of technical aids ; removal of social and physical barriers ; provision of allowances ; and financial assistance to disabled persons for purchasing their own homes .  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Although the current scale of assessments had been blamed by some for the Organizations financial difficulties , that scale had been based on extensive negotiations among all Member States and had proved to be fair and reasonable in practice , since it basically reflected the Members capacity to pay .  
If a substantial portion of the outstanding contributions was paid , the level of the Organizations reserves could be restored , the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund fully capitalized , amounts owed to troop-contributing countries fully paid , and the budgetary surpluses retained from earlier financial periods returned to Member States , or , preferably , used to strengthen permanently the level of the Organizations reserves , giving the United Nations the assured funding base it required .  
Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes , in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
The enormous financial gains from illicit transactions , the abundant availability of small arms and the most sophisticated weaponry alike , as well as easy access to technology all help to create an ever more dangerous type of terrorist .  
Calls upon all Governments , and all relevant United Nations organizations , and multilateral and regional financial institutions to increase allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Appeals to the international community and to relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system to continue providing financial , technical and material assistance to the Community in order to enable it to further advance the process of regional economic integration ;  
Thirdly , financial and exchange rate instability were closely related and in fact fueled one another , with the result that an integrated treatment of trade and finance was essential for designing consistent national and global policies .  
It is of considerable regret to us that some of the soldiers serving in Sierra Leone on behalf of the international community , the non-UNAMSIL ECOMOG contingents , will not be funded on this basis and will instead continue to rely on voluntary contributions , which have been desperately slow in coming and which are , at least on the basis of past practice , unlikely to relieve significantly the financial burden ECOMOG troop-contributors have assumed .  
Moreover , these strategies and policies should be formulated with a view to greater coherence between the structural , macroeconomic , trade , financial and development aspects of economic policy so as to increase the effectiveness of these policies , and help secure an open and stable economic policy framework conducive to developing countries integration into world trade , their economic and social development and poverty reduction .  
Globalisation through free trade and open investment regimes can improve the overall performance of developing countries economies provided domestic policies are enhanced by strengthening competition on domestic markets , by opening up new market opportunities abroad for developing countries exports and by increasing the financial resources available for investment in physical capital and intangible assets , including indispensable public goods . 
Stability and efficiency of the national as well as regional financial markets , increased domestic savings and optimal allocation of resources are a sound basis for sustainable economic growth .  
Whereas some emerging economies have taken full advantage of the possibility of attracting foreign capital , most LDCs were unable to do so due to a lack of adequate macro-economic policies and to the structural weakness of their institutional and legal framework , and in particular of their financial sector , as well as to the risks resulting from the volatility of financial markets .  Capital flow liberalisation must continue .  
the promotion of effective prudential supervision as well as the promotion of norms on capital flow transparency so as to consolidate domestic financial sectors in developing countries and to prevent global systemic crises ;  
Urgent measures were required , therefore , to remedy that situation through , inter alia , the provision of the technical , human and financial resources commensurate with the tasks and responsibilities of the Office of the Special Coordinator , which , even with extremely limited human and financial resources , had accomplished many commendable tasks . 
The Asian financial crisis has accelerated initiatives to improve the timeliness and quality of information concerning key macroeconomic variables as well as the financial reporting of banks and non-financial firms . 8 These are viewed as essential for better decision-taking by private lenders and investors , greater market discipline over policy makers , more effective policy surveillance by multilateral financial institutions , and strengthened financial regulation and supervision . 
Regarding key macroeconomic variables , an initiative had already been taken after the Mexican crisis when IMF established the Special Data Dissemination Standard ( SDDS ) in April 1996 to guide member countries in the public dissemination of economic and financial information in the context of seeking or maintaining access to international financial markets .  
In April 1998 , the Interim Committee proposed a broadening of SDDS , so that the system would also cover additional financial data such as net reserves ( after allowance for central banks liabilities under forward or derivative transactions ) , the debt ( in particular the short-term debt ) of economic agents and other indicators bearing on the stability of the financial sector .  
However reasonable the original managerial decision to make a loan or acquire an asset , and however justified its initial classification as low-risk by banking supervisors , the loan is vulnerable to a possible eventual deterioration in its status . 17 So long as cycles of financial boom and bust are features of the economic system , so also will be unforeseeable deteriorations in the status of many bank assets . 
The failure of IMF surveillance in preventing international financial crises reflects , in part , belated , and so far only partial , adaptation of existing procedures to the problems posed by the large autonomous private capital flows ; but perhaps more fundamentally that failure is due to the unbalanced nature of these procedures , which give too little recognition to the disproportionately large global impact of monetary policies in a small minority of OECD countries .  
Recognizing that mutually supportive efforts at the national and international levels are imperative in the pursuit of sustainable development , which includes , inter alia , the provision of financial resources and the transfer of technology for the application of cost-effective energy systems and wider use of environmentally friendly , renewable energies ,  
In order to carry out those difficult but necessary changes , Africa needed the international communitys support , including increased financial and humanitarian assistance , contributions to peacekeeping efforts , reduction of the debt burden , better access to export markets and incentives for foreign direct investment .  
While globalization and market liberalization had had a positive impact on some countries , the aspirations of many of the worlds peoples , especially those of the least developed nations , remained unattainable because of their worsening economic and financial problems and their burden of foreign debt .  The continued decline of commodity prices , along with protectionism on the part of the developed countries , had wrought severe hardship on the developing countries .  
Requests the Secretary-General , the specialized agencies and the regional economic commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stresses that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions ;  
Noting that the territorial Government continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Tunisia supported the idea of establishing a multilateral mechanism to control foreign capital and speculative flows in order to stabilize and regulate the international financial and monetary situation so as to respond better to the development requirements of the countries of the South and promote their progressive integration into the world economy .  
With consistently negative economic growth and development indicators , the African countries needed an international economic and financial climate that promoted fair trade ; increased market access for African products ; stimulated net capital inflows and , above all , gave globalization a human face .  
Those overall trends masked the serious debt problems faced by the heavily indebted poor countries and the fact that a growing number of middle-income developing countries had experienced serious payments problems , aggravated by the contagion effects of the Asian financial crisis ( A / 54 / 370 , paras . 3 to 5 ) .  
Many developing-country speakers stressed that the vulnerability of developing countries to external shocks , particularly to swings in commodity prices , volatility in international capital flows , and financial contagion , had increased as a result of greater global integration .  
Calls for effective governance of globalization through democratization of international economic policy decision-making ; integrated consideration of trade , finance , technology transfer and developmental issues by the relevant international institutions ; and reform of the international financial architecture and , in this context , calls for close cooperation and coordination between the United Nations , the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization ;  
Calls upon the developed countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of the development of developing countries ;  
It agreed on the need for good governance , an efficient administrative and institutional support structure , adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors ( A / 54 / 316 , para .  44 ) .  
Economic growth was strongly correlated with poverty alleviation , and thus the most useful approach lay in the creation of a sound macroeconomic foundation for sustainable growth , with open markets , transparent regulatory systems , strong financial oversight and participatory decision-making .  
Greater access to the markets of industrialized countries , international financial stability and technological cooperation on an equitable and sustainable basis were indispensable to improving the conditions of developing countries in the era of globalization .  
Conditions which might assist developing countries in addressing poverty issues at the macroeconomic , institutional and policy levels were , respectively , globalization ; the awareness-building role of civil society and the role of the private sector , particularly in creating jobs and spurring rapid economic growth ; and the achievement of a balance between the economic and financial aspects of development and social , cultural and institutional concerns .  
Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
Invites United Nations financial and developmental institutions , operational programmes and the specialized agencies , as well as other regional and international organizations , in accordance with the existing procedures of their governing bodies :  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating year 2000 issues in the areas of information technology , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management and legal , financial and administrative issues . 
Mr . Aleman ( Ecuador ) stressed the need for concerted action to solve the international financial crisis , and welcomed the Cologne debt initiative of the major industrialized countries as a sign of solidarity with countries like Ecuador , which had struggled with the impact of structural adjustment over the past several years .  
As national governments had the primary responsibility for setting macroeconomic , structural and social policies that would generate growth and contribute to poverty reduction , such comprehensive strategies should be country-driven and elaborated in close cooperation with the international financial institutions . 
Serious efforts should also be directed towards securing adequate market access for developing countries products , access to technology , stable exchange rates , reasonably low levels of interest rates and predictable and assured financial flows .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security , often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
Yet , as world trade , investment and financial flows continue to expand at a remarkable pace , so has the need for establishing integrated , flexible , fast , cost-effective and environmentally sound national and international transport and communications become more pronounced .  
The costs of establishing and maintaining an efficient transit transport system are often so high that landlocked and transit developing countries can not accomplish this formidable task without support from the international donor community in the shape of advisory and technical services and financial resources .  
Although most international financial and economic organizations do not have specifically tailored programmes to address the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries as a category , most of these countries are eligible for soft window facilities as they are amongst the poorest countries .  
Requests the Secretary-General , the specialized agencies and the regional economic commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stresses that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions ;  
In order to achieve respect for cultural differences within a context of national unity , national reconciliation and democratic coexistence , it is essential to implement a comprehensive , nationwide programme of civic education , for which the necessary human and financial resources must be provided .  
Invites United Nations financial and developmental institutions , operational programmes and the specialized agencies , as well as other regional and international organizations , in accordance with the existing procedures of their governing bodies :  
In conclusion , he stressed the importance of enhanced technological cooperation and financial assistance from industrialized countries in order to build the capacity of developing countries to meet environmental challenges .  
Measures requiring financial institutions and other professions involved in financial transactions to utilize the most efficient measures available for the identification of their usual or occasional customers , as well as customers in whose interest accounts are opened , and to pay special attention to unusual or suspicious transactions and report transactions suspected of stemming from a criminal activity . 
Adopting regulations imposing on financial institutions the obligation to report promptly to the competent authorities all complex , unusual large transactions and unusual patterns of transactions , which have no apparent economic or obviously lawful purpose , without fear of assuming criminal or civil liability for breach of any restriction on disclosure of information if they report their suspicions in good faith ;  
The growing openness of some economies made them more vulnerable to adverse external effects and promoted the spread of local economic troubles to other regions of the world , as the recent financial crisis in Asia had demonstrated .  
International financial markets and rapid capital movement drained financial resources from newly emerging economies through currency speculation , and huge transfers of resources from the developing to the developed economies continued unchecked .  
The developing countries , for their part , were dependent on limited overseas markets and exports and were at the mercy of the international financial institutions ; they suffered the negative consequences of globalization but had virtually no role in defining the rules of the game , and their repeated calls for democratic governance of the global economy had fallen on deaf ears .  
However , the internal conflict had considerably diminished the pool of financial and human resources required for economic growth , and the underground economy spawned by drug trafficking had caused huge distortions , not only of economic data but also of social indicators .  
Capital movements had played a large part in the recent financial crises , and developing countries must honestly evaluate whether their economic policies were adequate to face the challenges of the abrupt demographic , economic and technological changes resulting from globalization .  
While no effort should be spared to maintain that generally beneficial tendency towards a free market economy and liberalization , there was obviously an urgent need for much better regulation and supervision of the international financial system , based on common sets of norms and standards .  
In order to cope with global challenges , there was a need for a range of measures , such as international cooperation and partnership to reform the international financial architecture , including early warning systems and the introduction of responsible domestic policies , good corporate governance and efficient and transparent financial sectors . 
Besides sound macroeconomic fundamentals , a strong domestic financial and banking system with adequate supervisory and regulatory mechanisms , transparency and good governance were extremely important in order to guard against vulnerability to shifts in market sentiment and to contagion effects from policy weaknesses in other countries . 
Given the difficult financial situations faced by many Member States , however , he called on UNRWA to explore creative measures to alleviate its financial difficulties through alternative sources of income such as contributions from the private sector and expanded joint programmes with international organizations .  
Reaffirms the importance of ensuring the uniform and consistent application of the Convention and a coordinated approach to its overall implementation , and of strengthening technical cooperation and financial assistance for this purpose , stresses once again the continuing importance of the efforts of the Secretary-General to these ends , and reiterates its invitation to the competent international organizations and other international bodies to support these objectives ;  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
Calls upon the international financial institutions to ensure that in their development cooperation activities , the developing countries are not required to undertake obligations with regard to their development policies , strategies and programmes in trade and trade-related areas in excess or additional to those undertaken within the framework of rules agreed within the multilateral trading system ;  
Recognizing that the increasing globalization of financial markets and capital flows has presented Governments , the multilateral financial institutions and the international community at large with new challenges and opportunities for the mobilization of adequate and predictable resources for promoting economic development and social welfare ,  
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,  
Recognizing that the recent financial crisis has exposed the weaknesses of the present international financial system , and underlining the urgent need to work on a wide range of reforms for a stable and equitable international financial system in order to enable it to respond more effectively and in a timely manner to the challenges of development in the context of global financial integration ,  
Emphasizing that the United Nations , in fulfilling its role in the promotion of development , in particular of developing countries , should play a central role in the international efforts to build up the necessary international consensus on the wide range of reforms needed for a strengthened , stable and equitable international financial system responsive to the challenges of development , especially in the developing countries ,  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
It was high time that the basic rights recognized for national civil services and enshrined in ILO Conventions No . 98 and No . 154 should be recognized , with appropriate adjustments , for the international civil service , since it was unthinkable that ILO and the international financial institutions should fail to apply internally the basic rules they would like to see implemented internationally .  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to continue to implement the programme for the sustainable development of the region ;  
Again stresses the need for the international community to maintain its cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , with the Central American countries and to provide them with the necessary financial resources , in a sustained manner and on soft terms , with a view to promoting effectively sustainable human development and the consolidation of peace , freedom and democracy in the region ;  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to seek the cooperation of Governments , international organizations and non-governmental organizations to provide , within a mutually agreed framework of cooperation , the financial and technical support necessary for the reconstruction of a human rights infrastructure , including a strong civil society , in particular for the effective functioning of the National Human Rights Commission ;  
Good governance and transparency , good management of the State and financial and social policies should include : developing strategies for meeting the basic needs of the community , such as access to credit , in particular for women workers in the informal sector ; popular participation in decisions concerning the community ; equal opportunities in the competitive market economy and accountability in regard to the use of multilateral and bilateral financial aid .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 , 50 / 10 , 51 / 17 , 52 / 10 and 53 / 4 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
The Committee reiterates , in this connection , its request contained in its report on review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations that all future proposals by the Secretary-General on gratis personnel and the subsequent implementation of legislative mandates be in full compliance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and fully respect the relevant policies , procedures and regulations of the Organization ( A / 54 / 470 , para .  4 ) .  
Similarly , the rules of the multilateral financial institutions , implicit in the conditionalities of the IMF and the World Bank , which are applicable only to deficit countries or borrowing countries , should be reshaped so that the standardized package of policies , which is inflexible , is not imposed on countries , irrespective of time and space , particularly where some of its elements are not consistent with national development objectives in the long term .  
But almost all such diversification has occurred in the larger countries , with have more extensive economic infrastructures , higher levels of labour and technical skills and better access to financial sources , than the small or poor countries , especially those exporting commodities in structural surplus .  
Such low-income countries find considerable difficulty in attracting private foreign investment or loans from commercial banks , while loans from the international financial institutions have generally been concentrated in the larger countries .  
First were matters relating to the macroeconomic management of the world economy : institution of more effective macroeconomic coordination and of improved monitoring and surveillance of international financial flows , arrangements for quicker response to crises , and ending of a system where the private sector was too readily rescued from the risks attendant on its own imprudence .  
Globalization should therefore be re-examined from four broad perspectives : democratization of international economic decision-making ; integrated consideration of trade , finance and developmental issues by international institutions ; reform of the international financial architecture ; and effective action against the marginalization of developing countries .  
His delegation was convinced that the success of all the measures envisaged would be contingent on the restructuring of the international financial and monetary architecture to ensure a more stable and participatory system and the provision of coherent links between finance , trade and development .  
The solution lay in a globalization of development , and Pakistan therefore proposed the consideration of the following issues : creation of an enabling international economic environment ; reform of the global financial architecture ; integrated consideration of trade , finance and developmental issues ; a comprehensive and durable solution to the debt problem ; and fulfilment by the developed countries of their commitment to provide 0.7 per cent of their GNP to ODA .  
His Government was troubled by the financial crises that had emerged in recent years , in view of their considerable impact on the international system , and it urged the establishment of a stable monetary system at the regional level .  
The rapid growth of capital markets and financial liberalization was the other key pillar of globalization which had been projected as providing a definitive solution to the resources constraint that developing countries had traditionally faced .  
The issue becomes even more complicated when common procurement , personnel and budgetary services covering all organizations and specialized agencies at Geneva are considered , since those entities have , inter alia , different mandates , funding sources and modalities , varying budgetary and financial rules , and divergent personnel policies and procedures .  
Recognizing the valuable and effective economic and financial contribution that some organs , organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and the international community have made to complementing national and subregional efforts to advance the process of democratization , rehabilitation and development in southern Africa ,  
Appeals to the international community and to relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system to continue providing , where appropriate , financial , technical and material assistance to the Community in order to enable it to implement fully its Programme of Action and to meet the reconstruction and rehabilitation needs of the region and to further advance the process of regional economic integration ;  
Considering that the Caribbean Sea area includes a large number of States , countries and territories , most of which are developing countries and small island developing States which are ecologically fragile and economically vulnerable and also affected by , inter alia , their limited capacity , narrow resource base , need for financial resources , social problems , high levels of poverty and the challenges and opportunities of globalization ,  
Recognizing that mutually supportive efforts at the national and international levels are imperative in the pursuit of sustainable development , which includes , inter alia , the provision of financial resources and the transfer of technology for the application of cost-effective energy systems and wider use of environmentally friendly , renewable energies ,  
Calls upon Member States to promote the facilitation of cooperative actions between the United Nations system and the civil society , through national volunteer corps , in order to strengthen the United Nations capacities for early and effective response to humanitarian emergencies , and invites them to make the commensurate financial resources available through the special financing window of the Special Voluntary Fund of the United Nations Volunteers ;  
Calls upon all countries to ensure the provision of sufficient financial resources , on a stable and predictable basis , for the successful implementation of the work programme for the biennium 2000-2001 , and reiterates the recognition by the Commission on Human Settlements at its seventeenth session that this implementation will require substantial additional funding and its request to the Executive Director to raise more funds from all sources and to broaden the donor base ;  
The relationship between the environment and mankind had been discussed at Rio , where it had been recognized that States had common but differentiated responsibilities and that sustainable development required adequate scientific , technical and financial resources .  
Regrettably , the United Nations system continued to face constraints already addressed in earlier sustainable development efforts , including lack of financial and human resources , lack of institutional capacity , and vague mandates and roles of agencies , as mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report ( A / 54 / 131 ) .  
A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) on geographically mobile activities and financial and other service activities , referring to what it described as harmful tax practices , wrongly identified a number of Caribbean countries as tax havens and proposed a number of punitive measures that apart from being unjustified would be detrimental to those countries growing dependence on the important financial services sector .  
Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti is continuing to implement a structural adjustment programme , and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences , in particular the social consequences , of that adjustment policy , so that the country may achieve lasting economic results ,  
I , General legislative and institutional framework , para . 25 ) , one of the initial steps that should be taken by the Government in relation to a proposed infrastructure project is to conduct a preliminary assessment of its feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility .  
In order to consider adequately the financial feasibility of the proposals and the likelihood of subsequent increases in the proposed prices , additional criteria may need to be considered , such as the costs for design and construction activities ; annual operation and maintenance costs ; present value of capital costs and operating costs ; and the amount of subsidy , if any , expected from the Government .  
Calls upon all Governments and all relevant United Nations organizations and multilateral and regional financial institutions to consider increasing allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to strengthen funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Recognizing the valuable and effective economic and financial contribution that some organs , organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and the international community have made to complementing national and subregional efforts to advance the process of democratization , rehabilitation and development in southern Africa ,  
Appeals to the international community and to relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system to continue providing , where appropriate , financial , technical and material assistance to the Community in order to enable it to implement fully its Programme of Action and to meet the reconstruction and rehabilitation needs of the region and to further advance the process of regional economic integration ;  
Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
Noting with great concern that one of the major obstacles to the speedy implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative is financial constraints , stressing the need for fair , equitable and transparent burden-sharing among the international public creditor community and other donor countries and , in this regard , stressing also that the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Trust Fund must be adequately funded ,  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Considering that the Caribbean Sea area includes a large number of States , countries and territories , most of which are developing countries and small island developing States which are ecologically fragile and economically vulnerable and also affected by , inter alia , their limited capacity , narrow resource base , need for financial resources , social problems , high levels of poverty and the challenges and opportunities of globalization ,  
Recognizing that mutually supportive efforts at the national and international levels are imperative in the pursuit of sustainable development , which includes , inter alia , the provision of financial resources and the transfer of technology for the application of cost-effective energy systems and wider use of environmentally friendly , renewable energies ,  
To encourage and persuade other States Parties and financial institutions to join them in the transfer of technology and increased technical cooperation by providing more training programmes and modern equipment to developing countries in order to assist them in achieving the objectives of this Convention . 3 .  These measures shall be without prejudice to existing foreign investment commitments or to other financial cooperation arrangements at the bilateral , regional or international level .  
The Forum underscored the need for implementation of strategies in terms of investment , mobilization of domestic and international resources and in the case of developing countries , with special attention to least developed countries and developing countries with low forest cover appropriate financial mechanisms and / or measures including support through official development assistance ( ODA ) .  
Recognizing that the increasing globalization of financial markets and capital flows have presented Governments , the multilateral financial institutions and the international community at large with new challenges and opportunities for the mobilization of adequate and more stable resources for promoting economic development and social welfare ,  
Recognizing that the recent financial crises have exposed weaknesses in the international financial system , and underlining the urgent need to continue to work on a wide range of reforms for a strengthened and more stable and international financial system , with a view to enabling it to deal more effectively and in a timely manner with the new challenges of development in the context of global financial integration ,  
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts , in order to promote international financial stability , and to this end to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Reiterates its call upon the international community to pursue national , regional and international efforts to contribute to minimizing negative impacts of excessive volatility of global financial flows , reiterates in this context the need to consider the establishment of regulatory frameworks for short-term capital flows and trade in currencies , and invites the International Monetary Fund and the relevant regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
The need for greater support for the developing countries had to be seen in the context of four important realities : firstly , unless effective measures were taken at national and global levels to regulate , supervise and control financial activities and international capital flows , financial instability would continue to recur with increasing frequency and ferocity , destroying the most fragile economies and vulnerable populations and crippling their efforts to eradicate poverty .  
While developed countries had remained relatively unscathed by the recent financial crisis , in developing countries the gains of decades of economic and social progress had been erased overnight and millions had been thrown back into poverty .  
A continuing debate on institutional issues was essential in order to promote a stable and equitable international financial system that was supportive of long-term development .  
Global financial integration had helped generate strong private capital flows to some developing countries , but had also posed enormous challenges to national financial and banking systems in terms of ensuring the sustainability of those flows .  
Mr . Robertson ( New Zealand ) said that his delegation was committed to joining in the efforts to address the issues raised in the wake of the recent international financial crisis , namely , how to address stability in financial markets , how to find appropriate domestic and international policies to meet developmental challenges and how to secure greater coherence in the international financial and development system .  
On the basis of that resolution and in order to provide input to the report being prepared by the Secretary-General , his Government , with the support of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean , had organized a High-level Regional Meeting Towards a stable and predictable international financial system and its relationship to social development , which had been held in Mexico City from 5 to 7 September ( A / 54 / 384 ) .  
Many countries were unwilling to sustain the increasingly heavy financial , political , environmental and social burdens that resulted from accommodating vast numbers of refugees .  
Calls upon all countries to ensure the provision of sufficient financial resources , on a stable and predictable basis , for the successful implementation of the work programme for the biennium 2000-2001 , and reiterates the recognition by the Commission on Human Settlements at its seventeenth session that this implementation will require substantial additional funding and its request to the Executive Director to raise more funds from all sources and to broaden the donor base ;  
Measures requiring financial institutions and other professions involved in financial transactions to utilize the most efficient measures available for the identification of their usual or occasional customers , as well as customers in whose interest accounts are opened , and to pay special attention to unusual or suspicious transactions and report transactions suspected of stemming from a criminal activity . 
Adopting regulations imposing on financial institutions the obligation to report promptly to the competent authorities all complex , unusual large transactions and unusual patterns of transactions , which have no apparent economic or obviously lawful purpose , without fear of assuming criminal or civil liability for breach of any restriction on disclosure of information if they report their suspicions in good faith ;  
In accordance with current procedures , the Advisory Committee expects that full justification for the requirements of all support account posts will be provided in the context of the comprehensive annual proposals on the total requirement for human and financial resources from all sources of funding for all departments involved in the backstopping of peacekeeping operations to be submitted to the General Assembly , through the Advisory Committee , in spring 2000 .  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Noting with great concern that one of the major obstacles to the speedy implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative is financial constraints , stressing the need for fair , equitable and transparent burden-sharing among the international public creditor community and other donor countries , and in this regard stressing also that the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Trust Fund must be adequately funded ,  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to seek the cooperation of Governments , international organizations and non-governmental organizations to provide , within a mutually agreed framework of cooperation , the financial and technical support necessary for the reconstruction of a human rights infrastructure , including a strong civil society , in particular for the effective functioning of the National Human Rights Commission , was revised to read :  
While the military authorities and police had improved their methods and capabilities for combating drug trafficking by acquiring greater logistical , financial and human resources , international cooperation still remained essential , since it enabled the States concerned to exchange reliable information and advanced technologies .  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasising also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,

Transnational organized crime includes tax evasion , the forgery of clothes and electronic equipment , fraud against international financial institutions , unfair competition on international markets , industrial espionage , the import and export of protected plants and animals , trafficking in works of art and the illegal dumping of toxic industrial waste .  
Some studies indicate that criminal groups are slowly abandoning their involvement in visible economic activities and are diverting criminal profits towards the more secretive financial sector . 7 This diversion is said to make detection more difficult and the confiscation of assets problematic . 
The entry of transnational criminal operators in the financial world is believed to herald potential disruption , distortion of rules , erosion of ethics and suppression of competition ; ultimately , it is assumed to foster a purge among entrepreneurs , leading to the survival of those more criminally fit . 
In accordance with a guideline laid down by the Board of Trustees , the Fund as a rule only finances up to a third ( 33.33 per cent ) of any programme of assistance submitted to it and only finances those activities of an organization that are intended to provide the victims of torture with direct medical , psychological , psychiatric , economic , social , humanitarian or legal assistance ; it does not provide financial aid for other victims or other activities of the help organizations .  
At the 42nd meeting , on 18 November , the representative of Guyana , on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Group of 77 and China and Mexico , introduced a draft resolution entitled Towards a stable and equitable international financial system , responsive to the challenges of development , especially in the developing countries ( A / C . 2 / 54 / L . 38 ) , which read : The General Assembly ,  
Recognizing that the increasing globalization of financial markets and capital flows has presented Governments , the multilateral financial institutions and the international community at large with new challenges and opportunities for the mobilization of adequate and predictable resources for promoting economic development and social welfare ,  
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,  
Recognizing that the recent financial crisis has exposed the weaknesses of the present international financial system , and underlining the urgent need to work on a wide range of reforms for a stable and equitable international financial system in order to enable it to respond more effectively and in a timely manner to the challenges of development in the context of global financial integration ,  
Emphasizing that the United Nations , in fulfilling its role in the promotion of development , in particular of developing countries , should play a central role in the international efforts to build up the necessary international consensus on the wide range of reforms needed for a strengthened , stable and equitable international financial system responsive to the challenges of development , especially in the developing countries ,  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
At the 49th meeting , on 14 December , the Vice-Chairman of the Committee , Giovanni Brauzzi ( Italy ) , introduced , a draft resolution entitled Towards a stable international financial system responsive to the challenges of development , especially in the developing countries ( A / C . 2 / 54 / L . 72 ) , which he submitted on the basis of informal consultations held on draft resolution A / C . 2 / 54 / L . 38 . 
Recognizing that the increasing globalization of financial markets and capital flows has presented Governments , the multilateral financial institutions and the international community at large with new challenges and opportunities for the mobilization of adequate and more stable resources for promoting economic development and social welfare ,  
Recognizing that the recent financial crises have exposed weaknesses in the international financial system , and underlining the urgent need to continue to work on a wide range of reforms for a strengthened and more stable international financial system with a view to enabling it to deal more effectively and in a timely manner with the new challenges of development in the context of global financial integration ,  
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts to promote international financial stability and , to this end , to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crises in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
Stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , inter alia , through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements in the countries of both origin and destination of international capital flows ;

States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
That was why Tunisia supported the establishment of a multilateral mechanism to control foreign capital movements and speculative flows in order to stabilize and regulate the international financial and monetary system .  
In the present case the need was to pursue the globalization of development , a process entailing the creation of an enabling international economic environment , reform of the global financial architecture , a comprehensive solution to the problem of the external debt of the developing countries , the provision of adequate aid for them , and the establishment of a fair trade agenda .  
The matter of displaced persons and refugees could be settled only with the participation of the international community as a whole in establishing plans for integrated economic and social development through increased financial and technical cooperation .

Noting further that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
In view of the serious financial implications of the increased and unprecedented number of ex post facto presentations by field missions , regional economic commissions and international criminal tribunals to their respective local Committees on Contracts , and , when required , to the Headquarters Committee on Contracts ( " the Committee " ) , and in order to ameliorate the adverse consequences of this improper practice , the following provisions should be implemented immediately :  
We attach particular importance to paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution , by which the General Assembly emphasizes that all future and existing peacekeeping missions shall be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements and shall be provided with adequate resources for the effective and efficient discharge of their respective mandates .  
During the past four years under Mr . Ricupero ' s stewardship , UNCTAD has played a positive role in promoting the economic growth and development of the developing countries and has helped them significantly to integrate into the world economy , participate effectively in multilateral trade negotiations , predict and analyze financial crises and assess the impact of such crises on the promotion of international investment.He has also helped to channel assistance to the least developed countries .  
Notes the importance of joint efforts to overcome the constraints in implementing the Programme of Action , by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , deeper involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , and availability of financial resources ;  
Enhancing coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development and avoidance of international financial crisis and excessive financial volatility , and enhancing effective participation and integration of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the global economic system , including through capacity-building ;  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
The view was expressed that an educational institution should have been included among the public non-profit sector employers in order to have at least one employer working in the same substantive field as UNESCO , instead of four financial sector employers . 6 Furthermore , it would have been preferable if a more representative employer such as the French career civil service or the Ministry of Culture ( instead of the Snat ) , had been included . 
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
The liberalization of international trade , production and financial transactions , the increasing influence of global corporations and developments in information technology and communications all components of the globalization process are increasingly being considered from the perspective of their individual and collective impact on respect for human rights .  
In this context , the additional resources would enable the Secretary-General to make available an expanded range of programmes aimed at building and strengthening core organizational and managerial competencies ; to provide greater opportunities for staff at all levels to upgrade specific technical and substantive skills ; to support decentralization of human and financial resource management responsibilities and to strengthen career support mechanisms .  
The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section in previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .  
In order to give a rough idea of what that volume of capital means , I must point out that a single day of operations in the financial markets is equivalent to twice the annual gross national product of all the African countries .  
This policy has also included the organization and support of armed groups ; air and naval raids against our territory ; the hatching of over 600 plots to assassinate the leader of our revolution ; a military invasion by a mercenary army ; the most serious threat ever of a global nuclear conflict , in October 1962 ; and finally , a brutal commercial and financial blockade and a ferocious economic war against my country that have now lasted 40 years .  
For this fight against poverty and this campaign for emancipation to succeed , we must agree to a decisive review of the mechanism that underlies the economic fluctuation , that causes financial tension and its attendant social consequences , and that tolerates massive exploitation of the weakest by forces that are often impersonal and unidentifiable .  
The State of Bahrain is pleased and willing to contribute to international efforts aimed at achieving increased international economic cooperation , due to its stability and strategic location , and the trade and investment environment it enjoys elements that have helped it attract foreign capital and enhance its standing as an advanced financial and commercial centre .  
The eradication of poverty remains the foremost challenge for the developing world , where policy makers struggle on a daily basis to respond to the most basic needs of their peoples despite dwindling financial resources , disappointing economic growth rates and their countries growing marginalization in the worlds economy .  
These include strengthening the financial and economic architecture at the macro level , while at the national level promoting explicit pro-poor policies , investment in basic social services , participatory strategies and the empowerment of women .  
The inherent burdens of a weak banking and financial system , insignificant foreign investment , unfavourable market conditions and inefficient State enterprises , coupled with a lack of free - market traditions and experience , have compounded the reform challenge .  
To some extent , we are losing sight of the fact that political , humanitarian and financial crises have serious social consequences that have a particularly harsh impact at the community level long after necessary and welcome decisions begin to have a positive effect in specific areas .  
In the four years since the Summit , the developing countries have enjoyed little in the way of the technical and financial cooperation for development that was committed and certainly they have not engaged the path to rapid , broad-based sustainable development.It is in fact somewhat difficult to undertake a review of progress made in follow-up activities when the economic picture today is bleaker than it was at the time of the Summit .  
Here , too , it is apparent that without a more favourable international environment , without significant financial input , without real alleviation , if not outright cancellation , of the debt and without a sustained and lasting rate of growth , the laudable and courageous efforts and the sacrifices made so far by the African countries will prove insufficient , if not useless , in the face of the great needs of the African peoples .  
Thus , as was so well pointed out by the Economic and Social Council during its substantive session in 1999 , the international community has a deciding role to play in supporting action to eliminate poverty , promote productive employment , achieve gender equality and mobilize new and additional financial resources in order to guarantee the implementation of the agreed objectives of social development .  
The ensuing concentration of power and influence lies in the hands of those nations , institutions and individuals that can master the wealth of information on all aspects of human interaction , be it economic , financial , political , social or cultural .  
The IPU has taken up the cause of the large segment of humanity which is not a beneficiary of globalization and , at the recent conference in Berlin , discussed the need to revise the current global financial and economic model , and adopted a resolution which called for special initiatives for underdeveloped , debt-ridden countries .  
One-thousand-six-hundred representatives from 131 countries came to Berlin and cooperated in the drafting of important resolutions on the promotion of international humanitarian law ; on the peaceful coexistence of ethnic , cultural and religious minorities , including migrant populations within a single State ; and on the need to revise the current global financial and economic model .  
Our strong moral , political and financial support for the Tribunal will ensure not only that future dictatorial regimes will be effectively prosecuted for their actions , but that there will never be a repeat of genocide in our continent or , indeed , worldwide .  
Mr . Mra ( Myanmar ) : First of all , I would like to express my delegations appreciation for the Secretary-Generals report contained in document A 54-259 , dated 18 August 1999 , on agenda item 33 , entitled Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
In keeping with these positions and on the basis of the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter and universally recognized principles of international law , Mali will this year again associate itself with the Member States calling for the lifting the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba by the United States of America .  
The rejection of this hostile policy directed at Cuba was also expressed by the leaders of the non-aligned countries during their twelfth summit meeting , held in Durban in September 1998 ; Malaysia strongly supported the final document of that summit , wherein the heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries reiterated their call upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial actions against Cuba .  
In this light , it is pertinent to note that the meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and heads of delegations of the Non-Aligned Movement during the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly , held in New York on 23 September 1999 , once again called on the parties concerned to strictly comply with the relevant United Nations resolutions and emphasized the need to terminate the economic , commercial and financial sanctions against Cuba .  
In the context of the process of growing interdependence , even as calls are being made for free access to financial markets , goods , services , it is paradoxical to witness situations in which obstacles to such interaction are erected unilaterally and without regard for their effects upon the human development of a people even more so when we see that those obstacles are erected by applying internal norms with extraterritorial scope or effects that run counter to international public law .  
The report ( A 54-259 ) of the Secretary-General shows , as have his previous reports on the subject , the destructive results of the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba as a coercive and unilateral measure .  
Mr . Nejad Hosseinian ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) : In almost all United Nations resolutions and decisions on financial and commercial issues and related final declarations and conclusions of high-level meetings in this system , the critical need for an equitable , secure , non-discriminatory and predictable multilateral trading system has been emphasized .  
Continued financial assistance from the international community for the Bethlehem 2000 project is needed for the creation of a strong , self-sufficient and sustainable economic infrastructure for Bethlehem that would provide a sound underpinning for social and political stability , which is a prerequisite for peace in the region .  
In the light of extensive measures under way to firmly set the University for Peace on a strong platform , adequate and proportionate financial support from various sources is required .  
The first stage was mine removal associated with the demarcation of the Peruvian-Ecuadorian border , which , under mutual agreement with Ecuador , was performed with national resources and the supplementary technical and financial support of four friendly countries : Canada , Spain , the United States and Japan , to whom we reaffirm our gratitude for their swift and favourable acceptance of our requests for assistance . 
Due to the magnitude of the problem and the climatic and geographic characteristics of mined zones , we believe that this stage can be executed within the time-frame stipulated by the Ottawa Convention only if we can gain access to technical and financial cooperation and to logistical support given by other States parties to the Ottawa Convention , non-governmental organizations and international organizations that are committed to the cause of achieving a world free of anti-personnel mines .  
My delegation also wishes to emphasize the fact that , for a country like Cambodia , which is one of the least developed countries , as long as the mine problem is our main concern , continued financial and technical assistance will remain essential to our mine clearance efforts if we are to rid ourselves of this silent and indiscriminate killer .  
Therefore we hope to continue to have the solidarity and the support of the United Nations system , as well as of international financial organizations and the donor community , especially those that pledged their commitment in the Stockholm Declaration , as their invaluable assistance is vital in order to overcome the structural problems underlying the effects of natural disasters .  
With its unsurpassed costs in terms of human and financial numbers , claiming some 50 , 000 victims and causing economic losses exceeding $ 90-billion throughout the world , 1998 was an annus horribilis , that clearly illustrated the extreme vulnerability of developing countries to natural disasters of all types .  
As our experience suggests , the greatest challenge that committed leaders of a developing country with a transitional economy and a new democracy face is to manage the tension that exists between democracy , seen and perceived as meaning a better life , and the harsh reality of financial constraints , lack of resources , structural inefficiencies and bad practices that need time to be fully addressed and resolved .  
New or restored democracies need : fair treatment with respect to the debts they inherited from anti-democratic governments ; preferential access to major world markets ; concessionary credit policies by international financial institutions ; cooperation in the economic , technological and educational spheres ; and the advantages to be gained from aid and assistance programmes by international organizations for our countries most vulnerable populations .  
We also call on the United Nations to increase its assistance to the OAU in order to strengthen the operational and institutional capabilities of its Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution in Africa , in particular by developing the Organizations regional capabilities in early warning and logistical support and by mobilizing the financial resources generated by the two trust funds established by the United Nations and the OAU for those purposes .  
We have seen that even in times of dire financial strife , this Organization has demonstrated its comparative advantage in attracting international attention and mobilizing a concerted and timely response to the plight of hundreds of thousands worldwide who have had their lives and those of their families shattered simply because of meteorological and seismic forces beyond their control .  
During the debate , the following major points emerged : globalization and the international financial crisis ; the decline of official development assistance and debt-relief initiatives ; good governance ; people-centred development ; poverty eradication ; the creation of productive employment opportunities ; basic social services ; and the role of civil society in decision-making , resource allocation , development and human security .  
Iraq was one of the pioneers in adopting organized scientific planning to mobilize and develop human and financial resources so as to achieve sustainable economic growth aimed at bringing about the prosperity of human beings and at maintaining their right to their natural resources and their environmental rights .  
However , it is always worth remembering that sustainable development is conditional upon a rapid stabilization of the worlds population , which keeps on growing , particularly in the poor countries , where growth rates are highest , and requires , despite the progress that has been made in the last five years , the mobilization of sufficient resources from the international community , and from the donor countries in particular , to enable the poor countries to overcome their financial limitations . 
The impact of this policy would have been all the greater on reproductive health and family-planning questions if the adequate financial means had been available to complement the limited capacities of my country , which has been shaken by an unprecedented financial crisis and the political transition difficulties of establishing stable democratic institutions .  
The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels , including the international level , to strengthen support , including financial support from all sources , to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity-building and institutional building , facilitating the access of small island developing States to and transfer and use of environmentally sound technology , as set forth in the Programme of Action .  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
Building on the recent small island developing States donors meeting , with special consideration from the international community for new and additional financial commitments and disbursements of resources , as well as better and more efficient use of ODA and other existing external sources of finance , taking into account the specific development needs and priorities of small island developing States ;  
We must express , however , our deep concern that , while at the national level the small island developing States have seriously demonstrated their resolve to implement the Barbados Programme of Action , as they agreed to do five years ago , the adequate and predictable financial resources that the international community pledged to provide to support the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action have not been fully provided .  
The State of Bahrain has put forward plans for two important projects in the field of biological diversity and integrated environmental management , with a view to obtaining financial and technical support through the Ministerial Conference of the small island developing States of the Atlantic Ocean , the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean , held in Malta in November 1998 .  
What is particularly noteworthy is that , with the accelerated pace of globalization and ever-fiercer international competition , small island developing States are encountering increasingly grave challenges as a result of serious constraints such as lack of financial , technological and human resources .  
The unfortunate consequences of deterioration in the economic environment , particularly in connection with the global financial crisis , brought , in some cases , a reversal of social gains , while there was an increase in human suffering and deprivation.In the affected countries , the impact of economic adversity was felt at all levels of society , but the poorest segments carry a disproportionate burden .  
Acknowledges that national machineries are necessary for the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action ; and that for national machineries to be effective , clear mandates , location at the highest possible level , accountability mechanisms , partnership with civil society , a transparent political process , adequate financial and human resources and continued strong political commitment are crucial ;  
Representatives emphasized that national machineries , in order to carry out their functions , should be equipped with adequate human and financial resources and be located where they could effectively influence government policy , preferably at a high government level , and where they can be protected from frequent political changes .  
Completion of the establishment of the clearing house mechanism to provide decision makers in all States with direct access to relevant information , practical experience and scientific and technical expertise , and to facilitate effective scientific , technical and financial cooperation as well as capacity-building and the transfer of environmentally sound technology in the context described in paragraph 3 ( d ) above ;  
Increase efforts to address the critical issues of fresh water and sanitation in human settlements in developing countries through , inter alia , the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the provision of financial resources for implementation , as elaborated in Agenda 21 , as a priority of the international agenda on sustainable consumption and production ;  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
Recognizes that the lack of human , technical or financial resources at national level could be hindering the submission of more voluntary national reports or relevant information ;  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
For many developing countries , human , technical and financial resources are still not adequate , imposing severe restraints on their domestic capacity to meet the requirements of developing and using sustainable energy systems .  
Yet while IMF rigorously monitored loan recipient countries ' compliance with loan conditions for financial reform , it only lamented the ill _ effects on economic , social and cultural rights and left them to be dealt with by other international organizations and bodies .  
Globalization had taken real power from States and vested it in an apparatus governing the world ' s political , financial , economic and military systems , consisting principally of the Group of Seven , IMF , the World Bank , WTO ( and , by extension , the major transnational corporations ) , the Security Council and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .  
UNDP ' s financial assistance to basic education was directed to primary education and alternative programmes , early childhood development , basic education for youth and adults , and education through traditional and modern media and social action .  
She deplored the fact that resource allocation and financial decisions were sometimes motivated by ideological choices which were opposed to the principle of universal , free and compulsory education even at the primary level .  
Recommends that , given the extent of the burgeoning energy demand and the financial constraints in developing countries , partnerships and collaboration on renewable as well as on conventional sources of energy , such as those envisaged in the clean development mechanism and the joint implementation arrangements envisioned in the context of the Kyoto Protocol8 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , 9 should be increased in order to :  
The Committee will consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , informational and financial arrangements .  
Furthermore , the trade imbalances between developed and developing economies , favouring the more developed economies , place development at risk in many countries , and the current global financial crisis compounds the difficulty of social , economic and political development . 
On that occasion the Heads of State or Government reiterated their concern over the fact that the arms race absorbs a major proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources in today ' s world , imposes a heavy burden on the economies of all countries , in particular developing countries , and affects international trade and financial and technological flows .  
Despite the budgetary constraints imposed by the current international financial crisis , Brazil had already pledged a contribution to the Trust Fund set up to support the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and encouraged other countries to do the same .  
Taking note of the decision contained in the recently adopted General Assembly resolution 53-12 on the rapidly deployable mission headquarters , China considered that in the current difficult financial situation faced by the United Nations and the relative scaling down of peacekeeping operations , the efforts to strengthen the rapid deployment capability should be focused on tapping the full potential of current mechanisms .  
He therefore rejected the notion that the permanent members of the Security Council had a special financial responsibility for the non-peacekeeping activities of the United Nations , as well as the idea that the low per capita income adjustment should not be applied to the permanent members of the Council or that a regular budget floor rate should be set for those States .  
18 . Reaffirms the importance of ensuring the uniform and consistent application of the Convention and a coordinated approach to its overall implementation , and of strengthening technical cooperation and financial assistance for this purpose , stresses once again the continuing importance of the efforts of the Secretary-General to these ends , and reiterates its invitation to the competent international organizations and other international bodies to support these objectives ;  
While the Government of Ethiopia is encouraged by the results achieved and is committed to continuing the demining programme , it is recognized at the same time that much remains to be done to get rid of all the landmines scattered in various parts of the country , and that this immense task can not be completed without international support in the form of technical and financial assistance .  
The Russian Federation has made progress in putting together a comprehensive programme for destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile , including the identification of destruction sites , the technology needed for destruction , protection of the environment , the agencies responsible and the overall financial requirements , which has been approved by President Yeltsin . A draft law , which will establish the legal framework for destruction , has received its first hearing in the Duma .  
Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti is continuing to implement a structural adjustment programme , and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences , in particular the social consequences , of that adjustment policy , so that the country may achieve lasting economic results ,  
The General Assembly has established the following six main committees : First Committee , disarmament and international security issues ; Second Committee , economic and financial issues ; Third Committee , social , humanitarian and cultural issues ; Fourth Committee , special political and decolonization issues ; Fifth Committee , administrative and budgetary issues ; and Sixth Committee , legal issues .  
AAPSO remains concerned about the impunity of international financial institutions , which are not held accountable for the negative impact of their policies on domestic economic and social conditions .  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasizing also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
The international community also has an important role in assisting developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , economies in transition and small island developing States , through the provision of financial and technical assistance to governments at all levels , to develop a range of meaningful and effective planning guidelines , codes of good practice , regulatory frameworks and policy provisions aimed at achieving sustainable tourism .  
The attention of the Commission is also drawn to Economic and Social Council decision 1998-281 , by which the Council , taking note of Commission on Human Rights decision 1998-111 , decided to authorize , if possible within existing financial resources , 30 fully serviced additional meetings , including summary records , in accordance with rules 29 and 31 of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , for the Commission ' s fifty _ fifth session .  
In what could well prove to be an exemplary effort to meet the challenges of post-conflict reconstruction and resettlement in war-torn areas , international humanitarian and development agencies , and financial institutions have forged partnerships amongst themselves and with the Government with the common aim of assisting the Government in creating possibilities for return as a durable solution .  
The resumption of dialogue with the international financial institutions and with private and official bilateral partners could enable these objectives to be met through the sound macroeconomic policies to which the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is committed .  
Regretting that the current crisis in financial markets , characterized , inter alia , by massive and sudden outflows of capital from the affected countries and the sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries and some economies in transition , has resulted in higher interest rate spreads , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Deeply concerned that the international financial crisis has acquired extremely worrying dimensions , posing a threat to world economic development , and that if it were allowed to continue financial turmoil could result in major setbacks to the global economy , in particular to the progress that most developing countries have achieved in the 1990 s ,  
Recognizing that the current crisis has exposed weaknesses in the international financial system and the urgent need to work on a wide range of reforms to create a strengthened international financial system with a view to enabling it to deal more effectively and in a timely manner with the new challenges of global financial integration ,  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening institutional capacities and regulatory frameworks , especially the regulatory and supervisory systems of the domestic financial and banking sectors ;  
Stresses the need to endow the International Monetary Fund with adequate resources to provide emergency financing to countries affected by financial crises as a result , among others , of the high volatility of international capital flows , and in this context also stresses the importance of sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the institutional capacities and regulatory frameworks ;  
Also stresses the need to strengthen international and national financial systems through a more effective national , regional and international surveillance of both the public and private sectors , based upon the improvement of the availability and transparency of information , as well as the strengthening of the role of the International Monetary Fund in this regard , and the collaboration of the World Bank with technical assistance and capacity-building in this matter ;  
Emphasizes that the opening of the capital account must be carried out in an orderly , gradual and well-sequenced manner , keeping its pace in line with the strengthening of the ability of countries to sustain its consequences , underscores the crucial importance in this regard of solid domestic financial systems and of an effective prudential framework , and invites the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and relevant international regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
Calls upon the international community to pursue national and international efforts , at the intergovernmental and inter-agency levels , to contribute to minimizing the excessive volatility of global financial flows and to distribute in a more equitable manner the costs of systemic adjustments between the public and private sectors ;  
Providing increased financial and technical assistance to small island developing States for building human resource and institutional capacity at the national and regional levels ;  
The development of renewable energy sources will depend not only on the choice of appropriate technology but also on adequate development of managerial and technical expertise , careful financial management and adoption of appropriate institutional approaches .  
For small loads typical of rural households in remote areas with sufficient insolation , solar PV systems are proving to be economically and technically successful , when complemented by an institutional approach , including financial arrangements , that provides for the installation of the systems and maintenance on a fee-for-service basis .  
The unique social , economic and environmental characteristics of small island developing States , such as high population density , relative isolation , limited availability of land space , and paucity of human and financial resources , limit the range of possible options for the sound management of waste .  
Taking into account the progress already made in international and subregional cooperation and coordination to make the most effective use of existing facilities , it should be noted that the major constraints for small island developing States are not so much the lack of scientific knowledge and technology as the shortage of financial and human resources more specifically , the lack of a critical mass of qualified scientists and associated institutions .  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others . . . .  
While military observers and most of the international civilian staff left the mission area by 30 September 1997 as scheduled , owing to the unforeseen scope and complexity of residual administrative tasks involving , inter alia , the re-creation of the Missions financial records lost during hostilities in April 1996 , the Missions in situ liquidation was extended until 28 February 1998 , with a small liquidation team continuing work at United Nations Headquarters until 30 June 1998 .  
That contracting authorities interested in developing a privately financed infrastructure projects , within their sphere of competence conduct a preliminary assessment of its feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility , as well as the environmental impact of the project ;  
One important measure to ensure the successful implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects is the requirement that the relevant governmental agency conduct a preliminary assessment of the projects feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility and the environmental impact of the project .  
Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote the role and capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries within the framework of a dialogue between the private and the public sector .  
Noting that the ongoing international financial crisis is adding further burdens to the external debt problems of many developing countries and that a number of developing countries have continued to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion , despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
A further review during the past six months has focused on bringing UNFICYP into line with the approaches in more recently established peacekeeping missions , while achieving additional efficiencies by integrating civilian and military personnel in terms of sharing responsibilities and decision-making , establishing more transparency and better financial control .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
But the socio-political burdens , the persistence of an apartheid culture which can not be transformed quickly , limited financial resources and still inadequate human resources constitute a considerable hindrance , not to mention the need to take account of the time factor , with South Africans impatient to taste the fruits of freedom even though the quiet revolution under way dates back only to 1994 . 
The world economic situation would be more equitable if capital flows were regulated and the unsustainable external debt of the highly indebted poor countries cancelled , and if a start was made on the democratic reform of international financial and trade institutions .  
Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes , in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
During the period under review , a number of small island developing States in all regions have been affected by adverse economic developments which have impaired their financial capacity to implement even priority sustainable development measures.This is particularly true for the Pacific small island developing States , where a combination of internal and external factors have impinged adversely on their economic performance .  
The need for carrying out adjustment measures in some small island developing States , such as Cook Islands , Fiji , Papua New Guinea , Solomon Islands and Vanuatu , to correct economic imbalances rooted in the past , combined with the recent economic and financial crisis in Asia , have had both direct and indirect economic impacts affecting domestic output , prices of export commodities and export earnings , incomes from tourism and foreign investments .  
Participation in international and regional arrangements allows them to pursue mutually complementary objectives in a holistic manner and to benefit from the synergy generated , but it also burdens them with a multitude of obligations which further stretch their limited resources , both human and financial .  
General Assembly resolution 50-225 stated that the rapid pace and interdependence of global developments and their implications for all countries had led to a need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management .  
an improved dialogue on global economic and social policy issues in the Assembly and the Council , the identification of policy measures that should be adopted at the national and international levels to address such challenges and enhanced cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions and other financial institutions ;  
ICSUs formal participation in the meetings and other activities of the Council is necessarily limited by its financial resources and the availability of suitable representatives , but the individual involvement of members of the scientific community globally and their expert contribution to the many issues addressed by the Council and its subsidiary bodies is substantial .  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the latest episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation do deteriorate further , and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily _ indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
In the light of the above , the Commission , at its third session ( 23-27 November 1998 ) , agreed to convene an expert meeting on the Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote SME development in developing countries .  
Having recognized that limited access to credit by SMEs is a major constraint on production and growth , many Governments directed public funds to SMEs through specialized financial institutions , such as agricultural and industrial development banks .  
There are also few successful examples of DFIs that have proven able to operate profitably with SMEs - among these , the Corporaci \ n Andina de Fomento ( CAF ) , a private multilateral financial institution which promotes sustainable development and regional integration by attracting capital resources for the provision of multiple financial services to the public and private sectors of the shareholding countries . 
This new policy should aim at the creation of more equitable and effective international economic structures in finance , trade and transfer of technology , as well as address the endemic problems of debt and transfer of resources , financial vulnerability , declining terms of trade in primary commodities , and restricted access to developed country markets .  
The Cologne initiative should be flexibly interpreted by the international financial institutions to the full benefit of all debtors without discrimination , and appropriate resources should be devoted to reduce considerably the stock of debt and its servicing , while bearing in mind that debt relief measures should safeguard social , economic and political stability in developing countries .  
In this connection , Ukraine underlines the importance of a more active and practical participation of the international financial institutions in providing additional financial assistance to the affected economies , and reiterates its earlier proposals to that effect , as contained in its position paper on the problems of implementation of the economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council ( see A 51-226 , annex-S 1996 595 , annex ) .  
The laundering of money accruing from illegal drug trafficking , and the use of such money in order to finance illegal activities , such as providing financial support for armed rebel movements that threatened legitimate Governments , posed a threat to international peace and security and made it essential for the international community to cooperate with the relevant international bodies . 
The unified international approach was the determining factor for making faster progress at local , national , regional and hemispheric levels because it was helping establish a common institutional framework for focusing efforts and enhancing the distribution and utilization of the human and financial resources involved .  
In that connection , the preparatory committee for the special session would need to address a number of issues , including foreign debt , the decline in official development assistance , factors impeding access to foreign markets and weak financial flows to countries in economic and political transition .

The debt-burden adjustment should also be maintained , since external debt was the main financial and budgetary constraint for many developing countries and , in some cases , had been aggravated by their stagnant or declining foreign exchange earnings .

There needed to be better coordination of the functions of existing multilateral organizations , bringing together the key international institutions and national authorities involved in preserving the stability of the financial sector and cooperating on policies to reduce systemic risk .  
Without a shared sense of social responsibility and urgency , little progress would be achieved ; on the other hand , the considerable financial , technological and information resources of the private sector , if applied with a sense of social responsibility , could contribute to the cause of human rights .

It is obtained on the financial market primarily by means of loans extended to the project company by national or foreign commercial banks , typically using funds that originate from short - to medium-term deposits remunerated by those banks at floating interest rates .  
In addition to loans and guarantees extended by commercial banks and national or multilateral public financial institutions , in a number of cases public funds have been combined with private capital for financing new projects.Such public funds may originate from government income or sovereign borrowing .  
Many global and regional financial institutions and national development funding agencies have established guidelines or other requirements governing procurement with funds provided by them , which is typically reflected in their standard loan agreements ( see also chap .  
One important measure to ensure the successful implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects is the requirement that the relevant public authority conduct a preliminary assessment of the projects feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility and the environmental impact of the project .

The opening of many countries to global financial markets has created situations in which Governments , at both local and national levels , have new access to opportunities to borrow , yet many of the officials concerned have little or no experience with the workings of financial markets and no accurate concept of their abilities to repay the loans.This has led to numerous cases of potential public default or bankruptcy .  
The continued imposition by international financial institutions upon some developing countries of policies for structural adjustment can have profoundly negative impacts on the poor and vulnerable .  
Guatemala supported the establishment of a special task force to define that partnership , and believed that it should be composed of a dozen or so representatives of the Secretariat and the administration of the World Bank and IMF and their respective intergovernmental agencies and should focus on studying the limits within which the multilateral financial institutions could participate in activities , on the understanding that the final decision lay with Member States . 
The more advanced developing countries had also been hit very hard by the financial crises and sudden massive outflows of capital , which had severely affected the real economy .  
Moreover , the financial crises appeared to be increasingly frequent and more severe and it was beginning to be understood that they were the result of the malfunctioning of international capital markets and that global action was needed to overcome them . 
The high-level intergovernmental event on financing for development should launch a process of releasing resources for development from all parts of the global economic system , including the economic and financial sectors , foreign direct investment , enhanced official development assistance , and the fulfilment of all the internationally agreed targets for development .

The fact that the number of people worldwide living in abject poverty has increased is a clear signal of the imbalances and bias in the current global financial and trading system .  
These include local and regional armed conflicts , growing indebtedness , rampant poverty , scarcity of financial resources , and the spread of dangerous diseases such as HIV / AIDS and malaria .  
They include improved market access , deep and broader debt relief , foreign direct investment and other capital inflows , and financial and technical support in the multilateral trading system .

Since most answers to environmental problems financial , technological and managerial lay with the private sector , the traditional focus on the intergovernmental process was no longer sufficient .

That encouraging trend required adequate financial and material assistance as well as the political and moral support of the international community .  
Recognizing that natural disasters constitute a major problem for development whose solution requires considerable resources and calls for efforts at the national level to be supplemented by international financial and technical assistance ,

Many Governments stressed that developing countries would need technical and financial assistance from the international community to prepare effectively for and participate in the national and regional preparatory processes .  
The policies and actions of international financial institutions that advocated such liberalization and stressed structural adjustment and fiscal prudence when the crisis struck were viewed by many as exacerbating the negative social impact of the crisis .  
First , trade liberalization and the demands of global capital markets and financial institutions have to varying extents constrained the deployment of monetary and fiscal policy options for social purposes , including employment and equity objectives .

The current practice in financial regulation and supervision is for the Bank of International Settlements ( BIS ) to formulate standards expected to be applied by national authorities , rather than to establish a global regulatory agency .  
The dynamic development of the financial system and the capital market demand reliable ground rules and strong regulatory frameworks in order to guarantee the stability of the relevant systems and the adequate protection of savers .

Apart from national economies , there is an urgent need to strengthen multilateral surveillance and monitoring of international financial markets , with special emphasis on short-term capital flows , and to strengthen early warning capacity and modalities to prevent future crises .  
Investment in conflict prevention should be seen as our premium for a secure future , a future insured against the costs of war financial , human and material a future assured of shared security instead of a shared burden .  
Finally , the increasing incidence and magnitude of natural disasters confirms the need for and importance of efficient coordination at all levels in disaster preparedness and emergency response ; information-sharing and early warning systems to mitigate the impact of natural disasters ; and , above all , a ready pool of resources , including financial resources that can be deployed and utilized immediately , thus minimizing human suffering .

While all these measures are , from our point of view , extremely positive , given the difficult circumstances the country is going through and the prevalence of extreme poverty among its population , we unfortunately find that the international community is still hesitant in mobilizing the financial resources and other forms of assistance that the country requires to address the enormous challenges , which are only increasing day by day . 
As concerns the economic dimension , we fully endorse the priorities set by the Special Representative to hand over a balanced budget to the provisional self-government , to introduce modern financial management and to develop a Kosovo-wide public investment programme within the framework of the Kosovo consolidated budget .  
The Interlaken process focused on the practical and technical aspects involved in designing effective financial sanctions and ensuring their successful implementation .  
The Council looks forward to receiving information on the financial implications of the follow-on mission and a detailed assessment of shared responsibilities among the principal interacting players , i.e . the United Nations system , international financial institutions , regional mechanisms and national donors in their efforts to assist East Timor in its unprecedented transition to self-government .  
Although we believe that the main responsibility for bridging this gap and implementing international rules aimed at protecting children in armed conflicts lies above all with national Governments , we are also fully convinced that the international community has an important role to play in providing the necessary technical and financial support to protect , reintegrate and psychologically rehabilitate children .  
He described the right to development as a vector composed of various elements including the right to food , the right to health , the right to education , the right to housing and other economic , social and cultural rights , as well as all the civil and political rights together with the rates of growth of GDP and other financial , technical and institutional resources that enable any improvement in the well-being of the entire population and the realization of the rights to be sustained .  
The independent expert has drawn attention to the following multilateral facilities dealing with the debt problems of developing countries : structural adjustment and concessional financing facilities of international financial institutions , world trade organizations and developed industrial countries programmes of providing market access , restructuring of the international financial system to solve the many problems of inadequacy and instability of financial flows of developing countries .  
With a view to promoting the implementation of article 22 of the Unified Economic Agreement , concerning the coordination of financial , monetary and banking policies , enhanced cooperation between monetary institutions and central banks and the endeavour to adopt a single currency and thus complete the process of economic integration , the Council approved a common peg for the currencies of member States as a preliminary step towards the achievement of this goal .  
The enhanced stability of the exchange rates for the currencies of the GCC countries by the adoption of a common peg for those currencies and the coordination of financial , economic and monetary policies as a preliminary step towards a single currency and the establishment of a monetary union .  
A report on the Plan of Action had analysed results in 12 areas , including obstacles faced and lessons learned , among them the unwillingness of certain parents to permit their daughters to have vocational or technical training ; the policy of privatizing of health services , which prevents early detection of disease ; the lack of proper records on violence against women ; strong patriarchal attitudes in society ; and the limited access to financial resources that impedes women from running for elected office .  
On the basis of the deliberations on expert submissions , experts identified a number of best practices in the application of HCMs ( such as providing accurate , up-to-date and high-quality information ; instituting regular home-host country exchanges ; promoting creative mechanisms to overcome cultural and linguistic gaps ; using interregional exchange forums ; providing financial assistance and investment insurance ; and agreements on investment protection and double taxation , market access and technology transfer , including support for host countries absorptive capacity ) that would increase their effectiveness .  
That the current status also reflects some shortcomings and failures : recurring conflicts , interruptions in democratic processes , genocide and massacres , serious violations of human rights , the persistence of behaviours hindering the development of a democratic culture , the lack of independence in certain institutions , and economic , financial and social constraints , which cause citizens to lose faith in democracy ;  
Content : Structural features of and trends in the financial system ; the role of capital flow vulnerability of developing countries in recent financial crises ; implications of external debt for the formulation of domestic and foreign economic policies ; the World Banks Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSP ) initiatives ; the debate on the international financial architecture ; the coherence between the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the World Trade Organization ; and domestic and foreign sources of financing for development .  
In my report to the Security Council , I underscored the need for a viable and sustainable financial mechanism and noted that a financial mechanism based on voluntary contributions will not provide the assured and continuous source of funding required for the operation of the Special Court ( S / 2000 / 915 , para .  70 ) .  
This required a continuing dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies and development agencies from developed countries .  
It would be unwise to suddenly replace a stable financial and budgetary system , which had evolved through experience and could be further improved , by another system based on untested assumptions and vague concepts which could be inappropriate for the United Nations .  
It should establish an ad hoc working group , accountable to the Secretary-General of the United Nations , to study conditions and criteria to be established for such volunteer work , based on practical experiences ; consider legal , administrative and financial modalities ; and formulate proposals with a view to creating a legal framework conducive to their implementation .  
As the UNDP Resident Representative in Malabo had informed the Minister in a letter dated 4 February 2000 , technical and financial assistance in connection with the elections was made conditional on a mission to evaluate the conditions in which the electoral process would take place as well as the existence of prior agreement on United Nations involvement throughout the electoral process and the unrestricted participation of candidates of all political parties .  
It was therefore necessary to support country programmes and integrated regional programmes , which enabled beneficiaries to obtain a more specific range of technical cooperation services , while themselves determining the fundamental direction of their economic development .  Implementation of those programmes could of course run into difficulties through a lack of resources , problems of evaluating results and demand that exceeded existing financial possibilities .  
Its contribution would , however , be more effective if the international economic environment was more propitious , with better distribution of foreign direct investment and private financial flows , market access , a lasting solution to the debt problem and enhanced levels of development finance .  
Governments had a key role to play in implementing policies aimed at promoting financial , social and economic stability , harnessing the benefits of globalization and promoting and protecting human rights at the national and international levels .  
While international efforts could create conducive conditions for economic development , the primary responsibility for a nations development lay with its Government and people , and discussions on financing growth the development should focus on how to help LDCs mobilize domestic financial resources and attract external resources .  
Financial liberalization , while implying a reduction of government control over capital flows and the distortions resulting therefrom , had also increased the potential for instability in cases of excessive indebtedness , inadequate maturity structures , unsustainable exchange rates , lack of management of external savings , or speculative behaviour of financial market participants .  
The representative of Bangladesh , speaking on behalf of the least developed countries , said that economic interdependence was a matter of utmost importance for the developing countries , and their interests had to be recognized and reflected in the reform of the international financial system . 
It was worrying that the international financial community had so far not attached much importance to the development crisis in Africa since its impact at the global level was considered to be limited .  
The representative of France , speaking on behalf of the European Union , said that the European Union considered technical cooperation to be at the centre of the operational activities of UNCTAD and thus encouraged all member States with the necessary financial means , and in particular developed countries , to contribute to those UNCTAD activities which were financed through extrabudgetary resources .  
The net unutilized balance of $ 211,700 under this heading was primarily attributable to lower than budgeted requirements under troop costs ( $ 295,900 ) owing to the earlier than anticipated repatriation of contingent personnel , as well as savings under the emplacement , rotation and repatriation of troops as a result of the non-utilization of funds for the repatriation of the medical unit personnel in the absence , during the financial period of a claim , from the Government concerned ( $ 62,800 ) .  
Objective : To strengthen international cooperation and assistance to Governments in tackling crime problems such as those posed by transnational organized crime , trafficking in persons , economic and financial crime , including money laundering , corruption , illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , as well as to promote fair and efficient criminal justice systems .  
The challenge ahead requires [ adequate ] [ new and additional ] financial resources , technology transfer , and , where appropriate , political will , as well as commitment to innovative ways of applying energy efficient , environmentally sound and cost-effective technologies and systems to all sectors of the economy .  
In the view of the delegation , this , independently of and alongside international financial assistance and technical cooperation , constituted the main source of genuine internal resources which were an important factor for the generation of economic and social development in developing countries .  
In particular , some delegations noted that market access for developing countries to developed country markets should be improved and the international financial system should be strengthened to prevent external crises and to provide a beneficial framework for developing countries to access long-term capital and technical assistance for development .  
Bearing in mind the existing efforts in this respect , it is necessary to enhance efforts at evaluating and addressing the impact of international economic issues such as international macro-economic decisions-making , debt burden , international trade , market access , functioning of international financial institutions , transfer of technology , bridging of the knowledge gap ( digital divide ) , impact of intellectual property regimes , fulfilment of international development commitments and migration issues on the enjoyment of human rights .  
The balance of the appropriations remaining unobligated at the close of the financial period , after deducting therefrom any contributions from States Parties relating to that financial year which remain unpaid , shall form part of any cash surplus of the budget and shall be treated in accordance with regulation 4.4 bis .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided in regulation 4.3 , the then remaining unspent balance of appropriations retained after deducting therefrom any contributions from States Parties relating to the financial period of the appropriations which remain unpaid shall be treated as a cash surplus as in regulation 4.3 .  
For the Meeting the UNCTAD secretariat had prepared an issues note that identified and described six broad areas of HCMs : information provision and technical assistance ; financial support ; fiscal incentives ; investment insurance ; investment-related trade measures influencing the volume , sectoral composition and geographical distribution of FDI in host countries through market access preferences and export promotion devices ; and measures geared specifically to the facilitation of transfer of technology .  
Examples included providing accurate , up-to-date and high-quality information ; instituting regular homehost country exchanges ; promoting creative mechanisms to overcome cultural and linguistic gaps ; using interregional exchange forums ; providing financial assistance and investment insurance ; and agreements on investment protection and double taxation , market access and technology transfer .  
To promote Mauritius as a regional hub for financial and business services , participants called for policies that focused on creating capacity for rapid response in particular , accelerating the privatization programme , removing red tape , and keeping business and telecommunications costs down , as well as strengthening small and medium-sized enterprises ( SMEs ) by increasing quality and innovation for a quick turnaround in value-added activities .  
This inadmissible claim highly simplifies a complex historical and social matter ; it ignores the military and financial autonomy of the paramilitaries and the extremely clear and increasing instances of lethal acts of aggression against public servants .  
We stress that the major creditor countries should loosen their grip on the agenda for the reform of the international financial architecture ; they should accept that representation in existing multilateral financial institutions should become broader and more balanced and that meaningful participation by developing countries in the decision-making processes , as well as greater transparency in such processes , should be ensured .  
Additionally , it is recommended that the State party undertake further measures , including the allocation of adequate human and financial resources , to develop youth-friendly counselling , care and rehabilitation facilities for adolescents , especially girls , which would be accessible by them without parental consent ; in this regard , the Committee notes the development of Adolescent Health Corners at the regional level and recommends that the State party pursue its objective of establishing such facilities at the district level .  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) United Nations organizations are willing to cooperate ; ( b ) all parties concerned display the necessary political will ; ( c ) sufficient human and financial resources are available ; and ( d ) the economic and political situation of African countries is stable .  
The objectives and expected accomplishments detailed in table 27A . 8 above are expected to be achieved on the assumption that : ( a ) sufficient financial resources will be made available for maintaining adequate technical infrastructure and monitoring mechanisms ; and ( b ) programme managers will be supportive of the Oversight Support Unit efforts and extend their full cooperation in the implementation of recommendations of the external oversight bodies .  
The form of the assistance included study tours and training and the fields covered were corruption , crime detection , crime prevention strategies , criminal information collection and analysis , customs , drug-related crime , economic crime , evidence-gathering , extradition , financial investigation , institutional structures , institution-building , investigation materials , international standards and human rights , juvenile justice , money-laundering investigations , mutual legal assistance and organized crime .  
Many delegations noted the necessity of an adequate replenishment of the multilateral fund of the Montreal Protocol , and emphasized that the implementation of the Protocol and its amendments would be strengthened through provision of additional financial resources to the fund , along with sound and affordable alternatives to ozone-depleting substances .  
Many delegations called for increased international cooperation in financial and technology assistance in building capacity , education , training and raising public awareness , particularly in systematic observations of the Earths atmosphere and of the oceans and the land surface , including satellite data .  
Reasons for this disillusionment were seen as a lack of tangible benefits to developing countries from opening their economies ; economic losses and social dislocation in many developing countries caused by rapid financial and trade liberalization ; increasing inequalities of wealth and opportunities arising from globalization ; and the exacerbation of the global environmental situation .  
Some delegations stated that ODA could play a catalytic and complementary role in relation to private sector resource flows in achieving development objectives , including by assisting developing countries in strengthening their civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
It was noted that international development cooperation has a decisive role to play in enhancing the trade competitiveness of developing countries through the development , transfer and assimilation of technology ; promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises ; strengthening of financial systems ; development of highly qualified human resources ; and improvement of public school systems , especially in the areas of formal and non-formal vocational training . 
Elements of such an environment were considered to include sound macroeconomic policies , accountable and transparent governance , a sound domestic legal and regulatory framework , incentives for investment , the involvement of civil society in public decision-making and the strengthening of civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
In 2000 , the review of the coordinated implementation of Agenda 21 concluded that difficulties faced by the United Nations system could be attributed to constraints such as lack of financial resources , inadequate institutional capacity , cumbersome reporting relationships and inconsistent decision-making by the governing bodies of United Nations agencies ( A / 55 / 78 , para .  58 ) .  
The international community should also assist the small developing economies to overcome their constraints , such as lack of financial , technical and human resources , in applying WTO consistent anti-dumping actions against injurious imports , including through institutional capacity-building , assistance in the elaboration of legislation and the setting up of investigation authorities .  
Emphasizing that the Action Plan also states that the international community , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks should assist States in combating illicit drug production by providing financial and technical assistance for alternative development ,  
Urges the international community , including regional organizations , to undertake a greater and more determined financial and technical cooperation effort to support and promote alternative development projects , drawn up as part of national programmes , on the basis of the principle of shared responsibility as a pillar of international cooperation in countering the world drug problem ;  
They are determined to eliminate forthwith restrictions other than those related to customs , together with administrative , technical , financial , monetary and quantitative restrictions , and to reduce progressively , as agreed , all charges and taxes and treat Arab commodities as national commodities in the wider sense .  
In the interests of enabling the League of Arab States to fulfil its mission , perform its tasks , implement its programmes and carry out its activities , the leaders charged the Secretary-General of the League with taking the necessary steps and proposing appropriate formulas for the reform of all financial , administrative and organizational aspects of the General Secretariat of the League with a view to restructuring it , enhancing its working methods and performance and enabling it to address national requirements and keep pace with new developments at the regional and international levels . 
In order not to stifle those potential economic benefits , that delegation stressed the need to ensure that the final texts of those instruments satisfied the requirements of financial markets to overcome existing commercial risks associated with financing of space projects .  
The Programme of Action seeks , with particular reference to national programmes of action , concrete ways and means to effectively arrest and reverse the continued socio-economic marginalization of LDCs , improve their share in international trade , foreign direct investment and other financial flows and create an enabling environment for them to be able to benefit from globalization and minimize adverse consequences thereof .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
Recognizes , while bearing in mind the existing efforts in this respect , the importance of evaluating the impact of international financial , economic , monetary and multilateral trading systems on the enjoyment of human rights , while noting that issues such as those listed below are obstacles to the full realization of the right to development :  
In addition , the attention of the Committee is drawn to General Assembly resolution 55 / 186 of , entitled Towards a strengthened and stable international financial architecture responsive to the priorities of growth and development , especially in developing countries , and to the promotion of economic and social equity , in paragraph 25 of which the Assembly requested that the resolution be made available to the Committee as an input to its work on the systemic issues contained in its preliminary substantive agenda . 
That required that the developed countries should give financial aid to the developing countries in order to fund their basic social services , and should therefore raise the level of official development assistance , as well as finding an adequate solution to the debt problem .  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation to deteriorate further and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated , on an equal footing and a consistent way , with the realization of the broader social development goals , taking into account the specific characteristics , conditions and needs of the debtor countries ;  
Emphasizes the important need for initiatives on foreign debt , in particular in the expanded Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the decision of the Paris Club to go beyond the Naples terms , to be extended , expedited , implemented completely and made more flexible , and at the same time notes with concern the rigidity of the eligibility criteria approved by the international creditor community in the context of those initiatives , which is becoming a source of greater concern in the light of the latest symptoms of the international financial crisis ;  
Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources , in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation , and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms , as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms , combating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Urges States , international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care , research and treatment of the population in the affected countries ;  
Also recommends that international financial institutions , regional , national and local housing financing institutions and other credit facilities promote the participation of women and take into account their views to remove discriminatory policies and practices , giving special consideration to single women and households headed by women , and that these institutions evaluate and measure progress to this end ;  
April 2001 , endorses the Commissions decision to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions for three years , and approves the Commissions request to the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with an adequate and stable level of human , financial and material resources in order to enable her to continue to carry out her mandate effectively , including through country visits .  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) up-to-date and accurate economic and financial information and data at the country and regional levels is available ; ( b ) financial resources for technical cooperation programmes are sufficient ; and ( c ) political and security conditions in the Palestinian territory and region are favourable , and relevant data is available . 
Two main challenges in this respect , both for developing and developed countries , are to generally encourage greater flows of beneficial private investment into developing countries and countries with economies in transition ( volume ) , especially through the development and continuous amelioration of new and innovative financial instruments , and to direct these private financial flows to developing countries and countries with economies in transition , regions or sectors that do not yet benefit from such flows or are particularly dependent on external assistance ( distribution ) .  
Good governance , according to article 9 of the Cotonou agreement signed by all 77 ACP countries and the EU , implies a political and institutional environment that upholds human rights , democratic principles , the rule of law , and the transparent and accountable management of human , natural , economic and financial resources .  
Situation in least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked developing countries and other vulnerable economies is more difficult due to inherent economic problems of poor resource base , low productivity and lack of financial institutions . 
Supporting the efforts of developing countries to create open economies , with adequately supervised and well regulated financial markets , strong economic institutions , and credible and transparent economic policy frameworks .  
To include all IPF / IFF proposals for action in the plan of action is perhaps neither feasible nor practical considering the short initial time-horizon of UNFF , as well as the limited financial , human , scientific and technical resources available for implementation .  
The provision of increased financial resources , inter alia , through innovative approaches , as well as technical assistance and transfer of environmentally sound technology at the international and national levels , was highlighted in the final report of IFF . 8 It was also stated that such support is particularly needed for capacity-building , and for creating participatory and innovative mechanisms for financing sustainable forest management . 
The programme of work aims at the adoption and implementation of an integrated and multidimensional strategy for the right to development , a significant enhancement of support for that right from relevant United Nations bodies and a significant increase in the recognition of economic , social and cultural rights as human rights and their integration into the strategies and programmes of international organizations , agencies and financial and developmental institutions .  
The Secretary-General remains cognizant of the fact that , in order to be held accountable for discharging their responsibilities , managers need to have authority and control over their human and financial resources , timely and accurate information about the status of the resources assigned to them and training , as required .  
The trust fund so established is open to voluntary financial contributions from States , intergovernmental organizations , regional economic integration organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations , as well as to natural and juridical persons .  
The General Assembly recommended that , at their high-level meeting , the Economic and Social Council and the Bretton Woods institutions consider the modalities needed to consolidate further a broader global agenda for a strengthened and stable international financial system that was responsive to the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries , and to the promotion of economic and social equity in the global economy ( Assembly resolution 55 / 186 , para .  24 ) .  
Taking into account that the re-establishment of traditional sectors of the economy , such as manufacturing and tourism , requires considerable investments and given Montserrats limited financial resources , inadequate infrastructure facilities , including transportation arrangements , and reduced population size , the Government has proposed to examine the possibility of a greater involvement in service-oriented businesses based on information technology , financial services and telecommunications .  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation to deteriorate further and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated , on an equal footing and a consistent way , with the realization of the broader social development goals , taking into account the specific characteristics , conditions and needs of the debtor countries ;  
Emphasizes the important need for initiatives on foreign debt , in particular in the expanded Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the decision of the Paris Club to go beyond the Naples terms , to be extended , expedited , implemented completely and made more flexible , and at the same time notes with concern the rigidity of the eligibility criteria approved by the international creditor community in the context of those initiatives , which is becoming a source of greater concern in the light of the latest symptoms of the international financial crisis ;  
Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources , in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation , and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms , as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms , combating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Urges States , international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care , research and treatment of the population in the affected countries ;  
Also recommends that international financial institutions , regional , national and local housing financing institutions and other credit facilities promote the participation of women and take into account their views to remove discriminatory policies and practices , giving special consideration to single women and households headed by women , and that these institutions evaluate and measure progress to this end ;  
Encourages States to cooperate , including through bilateral and multilateral technical cooperation and financial assistance , in the implementation of their obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child , including in the prevention of any activity contrary to the rights of the child and in the rehabilitation and social integration of the victims , such assistance and cooperation to be undertaken in consultation among concerned States and other relevant international organizations ; VIII .  
In order not to stifle those potential economic benefits , that delegation stressed the need to ensure that the final texts of those instruments satisfied the requirements of financial markets to overcome existing commercial risks associated with financing of space projects .  
It is important to ensure sustained availability and flexibility in the deployment and efficient use of adequate resources for technical assistance for capacity-building , through enhanced convergence of efforts of concerned United Nations system agencies , in partnership with key financial actors , public and private .  
National efforts to mobilize domestic financial resources should consolidate enabling domestic environments geared to promote growth with equity , through good governance , effective domestic institutions , the rule of law and sound macroeconomic , structural and social development policies that are gender - and environment-sensitive .  
Based on common international understandings that respect diversity and specific country circumstances , these national efforts should be supported by an enabling international environment , including good international financial and trade governance and adequate external resources mobilization .  
How to strengthen public-private partnerships , including through ODA leverage and the support of the international and regional financial institutions , to finance critical infrastructure projects and other priority development areas for developing countries and countries with economies in transition , not only by sharing risk with the private sector but also by improving awareness of business opportunities in these countries ?  
What kind of awareness-raising and specific policy coordination effort could major industrialized countries undertake to fulfil their special responsibility in ensuring that their macroeconomic policies , including exchange rate policies , take into account their effects in creating an international economic environment favourable to equitable growth and development , international financial stability and enhanced financial flows for development ? 
Request the operational programmes and agencies of the United Nations , financial and development institutions , in accordance with their mandates , to assign higher priority and provide more funding to projects in favour of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , in order to combat manifestations of racism , xenophobia and related intolerance and discrimination , and to include such vulnerable groups at the stage of the development and implementation of projects concerning them ;  
Urge States in their national efforts , and in cooperation with regional and international financial institutions , to promote the use of public investment and encourage private investment in order to eradicate poverty , particularly in those areas in which indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities predominantly live ;  
The parliamentarians of the Republic of Belarus appeal to State parliaments and Governments , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , business , financial , scientific and religious circles , social movements and funds , representatives of the mass media , their compatriots and all peoples of goodwill not to forget that the people of Belarus have been living in an environmental disaster area for many decades and need active assistance from the world community . 
Such legislative , regulatory or administrative measures could include the use of authenticated end-user certificates , enhanced legal and enforcement measures , as appropriate , to control arms-brokering activities , requirements to ensure that no retransfer of small arms and light weapons takes place without prior authorization of the original supplier State , and cooperation in the exchange of information on suspect financial activities .  
Bilateral , regional and global assistance ( financial and technical aid ) to States in the area of record-keeping , weapons collection and controlling and destroying illicit surplus small arms and light weapons will improve State capacity and help reduce the circulation and excessive accumulation of this weaponry .  
The MYFF is designed to strengthen the Funds contribution to addressing the challenges faced by countries in the implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action and the key actions endorsed at the ICPD + 5 review and to help secure increasing , predictable and stable financial resources to implement programmes .  
Targeted effects : ( a ) helping to relaunch agro-land reform ; ( b ) helping to establish integrated and participatory management of catchment areas for a better use of space ; ( c ) contributing to the development of ( traditional and modern ) bio-food networks and to alternative energy production ; ( d ) facilitating access by vulnerable groups , particularly women , to private and public rural financial services ; ( e ) capacity-building in the area of State planning and monitoring-evaluation of rural development , food security and natural resources management .  
Notes with concern the late issuance of the report of the Board of Auditors on United Nations peacekeeping operations , 1 and requests the Board of Auditors and the Secretary-General to work together to implement ways to ensure its timely and simultaneous issuance in all six official languages of the United Nations , including streamlining the format and content of the report , as well as the related financial information contained in the performance reports .  
It is anticipated that more countries will be able to follow this positive lead in confirming increased contributions to regular resources for 2001 and beyond , thereby enabling UNDP to build on and start to harvest the financial dividend of the renewed political support to UNDP , within the context of MYFF .  
The aggregate income figure of $ 2.2-billion ( including funds from other sources ) masks the serious financial crisis that UNDP is facing in its regular resource base since regular and other resources are not interchangeable ; other resources represent earmarked contributions to specific themes , programmes and activities , and tend to be geographically concentrated , and are also not adhered to the programme priorities identified by the UNDP Executive Board .  
It will be extremely important to maintain high-level involvement , to translate the momentum created by the success of the UNDP ministerial meeting into a sustained process of engagement at the political level around MYFF that ensures the concrete rebuilding of political and financial support for a strong role for the United Nations in development in general and for a better funded UNDP .  
Faced with the continuing low price of wool , the Department of Agriculture is endeavouring to encourage agricultural diversification , while programmes related to wool production and marketing continue to be a major focus , among them the Agricultural Subsistence and Incentive Scheme , designed to provide financial support and to assist in the improvement of existing farming operations or the development of new farm-based enterprises and the Pasture Improvement Programme .  
In addition , public sector performance also depends on ( i ) appropriate sectoral policies in key social areas such as health and education ; ( ii ) productive capacity enhancement , depending on a vibrant financial sector ; and ( iii ) the streamlining of legal and regulatory frameworks .  
An important conclusion that could be drawn from the situation and the corresponding financial responses of the Advisory Committee and the Fifth Committee was that the budgetary mechanisms and procedures that the General Assembly had established in resolution 49 / 233 A had proven to be practical , flexible and durable .  
As indicated above , ACC continued to deepen its shared understanding of the synergies that have to be fostered among the different dimensions of globalization ( financial , economic , social , cultural , technological and human rights ) , so as to strengthen the knowledge base required for the development of integrated approaches that can serve to bridge the growing divides that globalization is bringing about in many areas , and to spread the benefits of globalization to all .  
The report addressed the following areas : mobilizing domestic financial resources for development ; mobilizing international resources for development : foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and other private flows ; trade ; increasing international financial cooperation for development through , inter alia , ODA ; debt ; and addressing systemic issues : enhancing the coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone until payment is effected .  2 .  In addition :  
Stresses the need for a substantial international presence in East Timor after independence , and requests the Secretary-General to make detailed recommendations in this regard to the Council within six months of the adoption of this resolution , which should be developed in close consultation with the East Timorese people and in coordination with other relevant international and bilateral actors , in particular the international financial institutions and the United Nations funds and programmes ;  
Noting that the effective functioning of national TCDC focal points and the full utilization of the TCDC modality , require , inter alia , adequate financial and human resources , as well as international support ,  
Decides also that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force , their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 324,900 dollars gross ( 297,700 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 2000 shall be set off against their outstanding obligations in accordance with the scheme set out in paragraph 18 above ;  
Decides further that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Transitional Administration , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 57,990,000 dollars gross ( 53,116,100 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 2000 shall be set off against their outstanding obligations in accordance with the scheme set out in paragraph 19 above ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor until payment is effected . 
With a view to achieving sustainable development of production , the agreements established the need for legal , institutional and financial reforms in order to consolidate a democratic , inclusive , decentralized and participatory State .  
Although it was reported at the end of December 2000 that the Executive Director had delegated programme managerial responsibilities to ODCCP programme managers and that they would be held accountable for the implementation of programme activities and the efficient use of human and financial resources , at the time of the inspection OIOS found no documentary evidence specifying the parameters of such delegation and the mechanism of accountability .  
It also fully supported the Boards recommendation in paragraph 27 of its report that the Administration should implement procedures to ensure that rule 104.1 of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations , which required obligations to be supported by appropriate obligating documents , was adhered to and also to ensure that obligations were raised in the correct financial period against the appropriate budgeted amounts , since raising obligations without valid supporting documentation created a potential for fraud .  
Notes with concern the late issuance of the financial report and audited financial statements for the twelve-month period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 and the report of the Board of Auditors on United Nations peacekeeping operations , 2 and requests the Board of Auditors and the Secretary-General to work together to implement ways to ensure its timely and simultaneous issuance in all six official languages of the United Nations , including streamlining the format and content of the report as well as the related financial information contained in the performance reports .  
Declining availability of financial resources , domestic and external , including ODA , a heavy and unsustainable debt burden , falling or volatile commodity prices , complex trade barriers , lack of economic and export diversification and market access for key products which LDCs benefit from , as well as supply-side constraints , have seriously affected the growth and development prospects of LDCs .  
The Programme of Action seeks , with particular reference to national programmes of action , concrete ways and means to effectively arrest and reverse the continued socio-economic marginalization of LDCs , improve their share in international trade , foreign direct investment and other financial flows and create an enabling environment for them to be able to benefit from globalization and minimize adverse consequences thereof .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
We resolve to promote increased and equal access for all people to open , efficient , effective and appropriate housing finance , to support savings mechanisms in the informal sector , where appropriate , and to strengthen regulatory and legal frameworks and financial management capacity at all appropriate levels .  
Takes note of statements made by the elected representatives of the Territories concerned emphasizing their willingness to cooperate with all international efforts aimed at preventing abuse of the international financial system and to promote regulatory environments with highly selective licensing procedures , robust supervisory practices and well-established anti-money-laundering regimes ;  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
With the highest rates of infection occurring in the age group of those between 24 and 54 years old , the productive capacity of the country is being diminished simultaneously with greater demands on our meagre financial resources , both private and public , for increased spending on care and facilities for the victims and to mitigate the devastating social and economic consequences of the disease .  
In 2001 , OHCHR has also assisted the independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty in the preparation and conduct of her mission to Bolivia to assess the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes and strategies by meeting with government officials , representatives of non-governmental organizations and poor peoples associations , as well as United Nations and international financial organizations in the country .  
Recognizing the fundamental importance of strengthening national , regional and subregional capacities to address and effectively combat HIV / AIDS and that this will require increased and sustained human , financial and technical resources through strengthened national action and cooperation and increased regional , subregional and international cooperation ;  
Within the present grouping of youth organizations , there is a further distinction between regional organizations with a large resource base , in particular from developed countries , and more loosely organized entities in need of substantial institutional and financial strengthening , often regional youth and student bodies from developing countries .  
Urges / invites Governments , the private sector and international [ financial ] institutions , [ particularly / including the World Bank and regional development banks ] , to promote participation by persons belonging to / members of all groups , including [ minority groups ] individuals and groups affected by or vulnerable to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in economic , cultural and social decision-making at all stages and levels [ in the development and implementation of poverty alleviation strategies , development projects , and trade and market assistance programmes ] ;  
Expressing its deep concern over the severity of humanitarian sufferings of affected civilian populations , the World Conference requests the relevant international institutions to continue rendering urgent financial and humanitarian assistance to populations expelled from their homes and calls for enabling refugees and internally displaced persons to return to their homes voluntarily , in safety and dignity ;  
Urges States and financial and development institutions to mitigate the negative effects of globalization by examining how their policies and practices affect indigenous peoples ; by ensuring that their policies and practices contribute to the eradication of racism through the participation of indigenous peoples in development projects in accordance with the principle of informed consent ; by democratizing international financial institutions ; by developing enforceable codes of conduct for transnational corporations ; and by consulting with indigenous peoples in any matter that may affect their physical , spiritual or cultural integrity ;  
The fact that General Assembly resolution 55 / 5 stated that the reduction of the maximum assessment rate should have no automatic implication for the specialized agencies merely confirmed that the latter enjoyed financial autonomy and that , in the case of UNIDO , the resolution did not prevail over the relevant provisions of the UNIDO Constitution , which in Article 15.2 stated that the scale of assessments should be based to the extent possible on the scale most recently employed by the United Nations .  
The Group was convinced that , in the current situation of limited financial resources , UNIDO should continue to enhance its potential for technical cooperation in environment-related activities by strengthening existing working relationships with other international organizations such as GEF and the Montreal Protocol .  
Takes note of statements made by the elected representatives of the Territories concerned emphasizing their willingness to cooperate with all international efforts aimed at preventing abuse of the international financial system and to promote regulatory environments with highly selective licensing procedures , robust supervisory practices and well-established anti-money-laundering regimes ;  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
The harm done to the Cuban people has been established before competent judicial authorities and abundantly documented in the reports submitted to the General Assembly each year by the Secretary-General under the item Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
Stressing the urgent necessity for international cooperation and assistance , including financial and technical assistance , as appropriate , to support and facilitate efforts at the local , national , regional and global levels to prevent , combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects ,  
States undertake to cooperate and to ensure coordination , complementarity and synergy in efforts to deal with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects , at the global , regional , subregional and national levels , and to encourage the establishment and strengthening of cooperation and partnerships at all levels among international and intergovernmental organizations , and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
States , regional and subregional and international organizations , research centres , health and medical institutions , the United Nations system , international financial institutions and civil society are urged , as appropriate , to develop and support action-oriented research aimed at facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of the problems associated with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects .  
The right to food is the right to have regular , permanent and unobstructed access , either directly or by means of financial purchases , to quantitatively and qualitatively adequate and sufficient food corresponding to the cultural traditions of the people to which the consumer belongs , and which ensures a physical and mental , individual and collective , fulfilling and dignified life free from anxiety .  
In its resolution 1338 ( 2001 ) of 31 January 2001 , the Security Council requested detailed recommendations for a substantial international presence in East Timor after independence , developed with the East Timorese people and in coordination with the other relevant international and bilateral actors , in particular the international financial institutions and the United Nations funds and programmes . 
Urges developed country Parties to provide technical and financial assistance , as appropriate , through existing bilateral and multilateral cooperative programmes to support the efforts of the Parties in implementing the programmes and measures identified in the annexed framework and to enhance the implementation of Article 4.5 of the Convention ;  
Urges Annex II Parties to provide financial and technological support for strengthening the capacity of developing country Parties identified in Article 4.8 and 4.9 of the Convention for improving efficiency in upstream and downstream activities relating to fossil fuels , taking into consideration the need to improve the environmental efficiency of these activities ;  
Article 1 of the Treaty establishing the Community refers to the establishment of an overall economic union based on the implementation of a strategy by means of development plans that are complementary to the national development plans of member States and that include investment in the agricultural , industrial , social and cultural fields and in energy , and it looks towards the financial future of the Community with every confidence . 
In light of the additional financial resources urgently required to enable countries to achieve the poverty reduction goal as well as the other Millennium development goals , the General Assembly may wish to urge Governments to continue to implement policies to enhance domestic financial resources further and to promote foreign direct investment and other private capital flows , and to put them to efficient use .  
The Council also held the fourth special high-level meeting with the Bretton Woods institutions on two themes : development financing , in particular poverty eradication , ODA and debt ; and a move forward to a development-friendly international financial system : public and private responsibility in the prevention of financial crisis .  
Though these figures are the result of a number of endogenous and exogenous factors , they are directly connected with globalization in that they reflect the gradual marginalization it has brought for the poorest countries , which lack the necessary commercial , financial and technological capacity to meet the requirements of global competition .  
To ensure that public resources have an impact on the living conditions of the target population , studies are being conducted in connection with the third phase of the integrated financial administration system ( Sistema Integrado de Administracin Financiera SIAF ) , which is responsible for preparing and executing the national budget .  The aim is to incorporate decentralized , autonomous and local entities into the system so as to enhance effectiveness and guarantee transparency in public administration .  
The Government of Mexico considers that the international agenda should envisage at least five goals : greater and more effective participation by developing countries in international economic decision-making ; a truly open multilateral trade system reflecting the development needs of all nations ; a new international financial architecture releasing resources for productive investment ; an effective prevention and response capacity to deal with international financial crises ; and sustainable and integrated worldwide economic growth .  
Globalization is a multifaceted phenomenon inclusive of trade liberalization , greater mobility of capital and increased financial flows , changes in labour demand , liberalization of labour markets and their growing flexibility , * changes in the process of production , changes in the role and function of the State , rapid diffusion of products and consumption patterns , more rapid diffusion of information and technology , new forms of governance and mechanisms of regulation , and the emergence of a global civil society .  
Governments , donors , non-governmental organizations and the private sector should develop specific assistance programmes and advisory services for the development of the economic skills of rural women in banking , modern trading and financial procedures , matching the requirements of the market economy .  
UNCTAD should promote establishment of linkages among all the stakeholders in the international market for construction services through continued dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies , and development agencies from developed countries .  
The recommendations adopted had touched upon four main areas : ( i ) what actions must be undertaken by Governments themselves ; ( ii ) what international and regional financial organizations and bilateral donors might be invited to do ; ( iii ) what and how issues were to be addressed during the multilateral services negotiations ; ( iv ) and what further work by UNCTAD was necessary in this area .  
As per the respective Commission on Human Rights resolutions , Member States of the United Nations are encouraged to continue supporting the efforts of the Office in this area and to provide additional financial resources as part of their contributions to the programme of advisory services and technical assistance in the field of human rights .  
In its resolution 55 / 184 of 20 December 2000 , the General Assembly , noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of heavily indebted developing countries , requested the Secretary-General to provide the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session with a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , including , inter alia , those resulting from global financial instability .  
An outcome of increased volatility of international financial conditions and frequent crises in emerging markets is the tendency to build up reserves as a safeguard against a rapid exit of capital and speculative attack on currencies . 
FDI has become the single most important type of capital inflow to developing countries , accounting for about two thirds of all resource flows during the 1990s . 2 The fastest growth in all types of financial flows to developing countries and transition economies over the past decade was in portfolio equity investments , which rose sixfold to reach an annual average of more than $ 40-billion at the end of the decade . 
The nature of a debt problem may vary from acute balance-of-payments difficulties ( instances of illiquidity ) to longer-term structural , financial and resource transfer problems ( cases of insolvency ) . 13 The need for repeated reschedulings of official bilateral debts appears to be related to the fact that the Paris Club approach was originally designed to address liquidity problems hence the importance attached to the cut-off date in Paris Club agreements . 
It appears that an effective and viable strategy for private sector involvement in financial crises in emerging markets would be to combine voluntary mechanisms designed to facilitate debt restructuring with internationally sanctioned temporary standstills to be used when needed .  
She called on the international community to commit additional financial resources and technical assistance for capacity-building in the physical infrastructure as well as for making available improved services and harmonized processes between the landlocked and transit developing countries .  
The representative of Brazil stated that for Brazil , a transit country for Paraguay and Bolivia , needed concrete proposals for the creation of innovative financial instruments of the national , regional and international levels , by financial institutions operating in the region .  
The representative of Peru stated that for Peru , a transit country for Bolivian trade , there is a need to establish financial instruments at national , regional and international levels : international financial institutions could help through special and innovative programmes to support the development , improvement and maintenance of needed physical infrastructure .  
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law and systems reform process but greater financial and technical assistance is required to help landlocked and transit developing countries effectively implement their cooperative agreements and arrangements .  
While landlocked and transit developing countries bear the primary responsibility to implement measures designed to strengthen their cooperative and collaborative efforts , the international community , including financial and development institutions should provide more support to enable these countries to deal effectively with their transit transport problems and requirements .  
The international community , including donor countries and financial and development institutions should strengthen their support for national , bilateral and subregional infrastructure and transit transport projects and programmes , including through the provision of adequate financial and technical support to one-stop borders post , as well as through improving current financing modalities and introduction of new facilities , such as co-financing , bank-to-bank loans , guaranties .  
However , the report describes two major problems regarding the administrative organization of communes , towns or territories , in terms of urban planning , public works , roads and drainage , etc . : extremely high levels of centralization , depriving officials at the local level of any financial or material means to act ; and a dysfunctional dualism between the environmental protection and nature conservation aspects of government policy . 
Some of the countrys partners having expressed a desire to re-establish their cooperation programmes , the various sectoral programmes prepared with the financial and technical support of United Nations specialized agencies will serve as support documents for resource mobilization and / or dialogue meetings ( consultative groups , round tables , sectoral and thematic consultations ) as needed .  
Here a broad trend was evident : those instruments with a specific target ( such as environmental protection ) generally had an in-built mechanism of implementation , including financial provisions ( such as the Montreal Protocol ) , while those instruments dealing with transfer of technology as a broad objective often relied on national measures in developed country addressees for their successful implementation ( such as the TRIPS Agreement ( article 66.2 ) ) .  
Although by and large , these commitments are in the form of best endeavour , they mark a significant departure from the previous two programmes of action by clearly indicating complementary actions between least developed countries and their development partners in seven areas : fostering a people-centred policy framework ; good governance at national and international levels ; building human and institutional capacities ; building productive capacities to make globalization work for least developed countries ; enhancing the role of trade in development ; reducing vulnerability and protecting the environment ; and mobilizing financial resources .  
Development partners agreed to effectively implement the enhanced HIPC Initiative and provide adequate financial resources expeditiously for the speedy and full implementation of the enhanced HIPC Initiative , and provide new and additional resources necessary to fulfil the future financial requirements of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative , on the basis of fair and equitable burden-sharing .  
The shortfall has restricted the ability of UNMAS in certain areas , including the development of guidelines , standard operating procedures and tools for operational and financial management ; monitoring and evaluation of new and existing programmes and projects ; enhancement of information management tools and mechanisms ; full integration of new and existing technologies ; development of appropriate training and evaluation materials for troop-contributing countries ; and implementation of an emergency response plan and development of required supporting infrastructures .  
The incumbent will provide much-needed capacity to conduct reviews and analysis of management systems / practices ; to identify preventive measures while adopting best practices ; identify and recommend policy reviews and proposals for implementing revised policies and procedures ; provide guidance to directors of administration / chief administrative officers on matters of financial accountability and adequacy of appropriate management tools ; and oversee ongoing development of standardized reporting formats for field missions .  
Position required to address deficiencies in the level of resources dedicated to the Asia and Middle East region : provides support for the chief on financial management of peacekeeping offices in the Asia and Middle East region , actions day-to-day correspondence , monitors status of allotments reports , assists unit with general administrative and clerical functions , responsible for coordinating unit reporting exercises and compilation of information ( IMIS ) for analysis by the chief .  
Further phases are planned and the eventual decision support system will contain all tactical information required to support the planning assumptions for rapid mission deployment , mission liquidation and redeployment of assets , build-up and deployment of surplus assets , personnel and contingent placements and mobilization , military and civilian mobilization , and financial and administrative information to support budget planning and financial analyses ( $ 150,000 ) . 
Re-emphasizes that extreme poverty is a major issue to be addressed by Governments , civil society organizations and the organs and agencies of the United Nations system , including international trade and financial institutions , and in this context reaffirms that political commitment is a prerequisite for the eradication of poverty ;  
Decides to extend an invitation to participate in the Social Forum to non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council and other non-governmental organizations outside Geneva and particularly newly emerging actors in the South , such as smaller groups , grass-roots organizations , voluntary , youth associations , community organizations , trade unions and associations of workers , representatives of the private sector , United Nations agencies , the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , the regional economic commissions , international financial institutions and development agencies ;  
Invites United Nations bodies and specialized agencies , the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , the regional economic commissions , the international financial institutions , the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , special rapporteurs and independent experts , non-governmental organizations , scholars , trade unions and associations of workers to participate in and to submit studies to the Social Forum ;  
Decides to extend an invitation to participate in the Social Forum to non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council and other non-governmental organizations outside Geneva and particularly newly emerging actors in the South , such as smaller groups , grass-roots organizations , voluntary , youth associations , community organizations , trade unions and associations of workers , representatives of the private sector , United Nations agencies , the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , the regional economic commissions , international financial institutions and development agencies ;  
Invites United Nations bodies and specialized agencies , the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , the regional economic commissions , the international financial institutions , the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , special rapporteurs and independent experts , non-governmental organizations , scholars , trade unions and associations of workers to submit studies to the Social Forum ;  
In paragraph 19 of its resolution 55 / 186 , the General Assembly requested the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) to provide information on the work it has undertaken to support the promotion of long-term private financial flows , especially foreign direct investment , inter alia , through enhanced technical cooperation , to all developing countries as well as economies in transition , in particular the least developed countries and other developing countries with special difficulties in attracting private financial flows .  
The discussions had concentrated on three sets of issues : the need for and role of foreign capital in developing countries ; how to manage the capital account to limit the potential damage from the instability of international capital flows ; and the role of financial institutions , and the possible contribution of global standards and codes on governance , competition and transparency in promoting stability and growth .  
Reiterates its call to Member States to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security and in this regard urges them to provide the necessary human , material and financial resources for timely and preventive measures including early warning , preventive diplomacy , preventive deployment , practical disarmament measures and peace-building as appropriate in each case ;  
Takes note with satisfaction of the continuing efforts of developing countries , particularly those in African countries , to combat malaria through the formulation of plans and strategies at the national , regional and continental levels , despite their limited financial , technical and human resources ;  
In real terms , that represented a negative growth of 3 per cent per annum , as the Agency faced an annual growth of 3.5 per cent in its clientele population driving a similar growth in staff and financial requirements , and an annual weighted average rate of inflation in the UNRWA area of operations at 4 per cent .  
The representative of Belgium , speaking on behalf of the European Union , said that the European Union considered technical cooperation to be at the centre of the operational activities of UNCTAD and thus encouraged all member States with the necessary financial means , and in particular developed countries , to contribute to those UNCTAD activities which were financed from extrabudgetary resources .  
Encourages the international donor community , relevant United Nations bodies and the private sector to provide support , including financial and technical support , for data collection and greater empirical research by Member States , particularly developing countries , and the relevant bodies of the United Nations system on the causes and patterns of migration , including on irregular migration and trafficking , as well as its social , economic and demographic impacts , and for documenting and disseminating information on successful migration management programmes ;  
The analytical potential of UNCTAD and its unique information base allowed member States to use the experience of developed and some advanced developing countries in structural reforms , privatization , stabilization of the financial system , approaches to indebtedness , effective use of financial and economic assistance , and regional economic integration .  
He drew attention to the continuing financial instability , especially in East Asia , and agreed with UNCTAD 's conclusion that the globalization of world financial markets had demonstrated the limits of multilateral financial institutions capacity to contribute to global financial stability , and that there was a need for fundamental reform of the international financial architecture .  
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law and systems reform process but greater financial and technical assistance is required to help landlocked and transit developing countries to effectively implement their cooperative agreements and arrangements .  
While landlocked and transit developing countries bear the primary responsibility to implement measures designed to strengthen their cooperative and collaborative efforts , the international community , including financial and development institutions , should provide more support to enable these countries to deal effectively with their transit transport problems and requirements .  
The international community , including donor countries and financial and development institutions , should strengthen its support for national , bilateral and subregional infrastructure and transit transport projects and programmes , including through the provision of adequate financial and technical support to one-stop border posts , as well as through improving current financing modalities and introduction of new facilities , such as co-financing , bank-to-bank loans , guaranties .  
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law reform processes ( drafting of laws ) , but greater financial and technical assistance would be required to help landlocked and transit developing countries to effectively implement their bilateral and regional agreements and arrangements .  
At the regional level three elements have been critical in energizing intergovernmental agreements and arrangements : ( a ) political and financial commitment by signatory Governments to follow through on agreed commitments ; ( b ) availability of government officials vested with technical capacity which enables them to formulate appropriate instruments and monitor and review progress in their implementation ; and ( c ) where the agreements involve many countries and a wide range of commitments , establishment of a permanent secretariat to coordinate implementation of such instruments .  
The Money Matters Institutes mission is to foster dialogue among leaders of financial services , international institutions and policy makers in developing countries to encourage the most realistic role for private capital in financing sustainable development , and to generate the requisite supporting data about emerging economies so as to facilitate this purpose .  
In the context of the international efforts being made to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and in light of the fact that countries that function as financial and banking centres have enacted laws on the laundering of the proceeds of illegal activities , the United Arab Emirates , after protracted study , has elaborated a draft law on money laundering that was approved by the Council of Ministers at its meeting held yesterday . 
On prospects for fundamental reform of the international financial architecture , the panellists said that enthusiasm had given way to the perception that it was virtually impossible to reach consensus on such reform , and that second-best solutions in the form of do-it-yourself approaches to crisis prevention and management at both the regional and national levels currently appeared to be the only politically feasible alternative .  
The panellists suggested that less reliance on private capital flows should be a common goal for all developing countries , because of ( i ) the volatility of such flows , ( ii ) the likelihood that financial flows to developing countries would decline in reaction to the less optimistic outlook for the global economy and to the falling profitability of FDI in major recipient countries , and ( iii ) the lack of meaningful international financial reforms .  
While bilateral cooperation , especially in regard to technical cooperation , remains a prevalent form of South-South cooperation , conscious efforts are being made by developing countries to pool their resources and capacities institutional , intellectual , technical and financial to address issues of common concern or specific development problems that affect a large number of people and countries .  
High rates of unemployment , in particular among young people , the non-functioning of the national safety net system , scarce opportunities for private investment , declining domestic production and other financial , cultural and criminal factors have contributed to political instability .  
The forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would be addressing the inequities inherent in the global economy and would bring together for the first time the United Nations , the Bretton Woods institutions , the private sector and civil society to consider how to reform the current financial system and find means of increasing cooperation to stimulate financial flows to the developing countries . 
Effective development strategies and economic and social sustainability depended on enhanced national capacity to operate within a comprehensive framework that reflected the interdependence of macroeconomic and financial issues with structural , social and human concerns , including environment and health . 
He stressed the importance of full implementation of Agenda 21 , especially the pledges made by the developed countries , based on the principle of joint and several responsibility , to provide financial resources to help developing countries fulfil their commitments and to transfer technology to them on a preferential basis and on easy terms .  
The forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would be instrumental in reshaping the world economic order and making it more equitable , by inter alia , coming up with a sustainable solution to the debt crisis and reforming the international financial architecture .  
Despite repeated calls for a change in the current international economic , trade and financial system , which did not meet the needs of the developing countries , especially those of the most vulnerable , no specific conclusions had yet been reached .  
Bridges should be built in the political , economic , financial , commercial , technical and social realm , and institutions should be strengthened at all levels , to facilitate such integration in a just and equitable process .  
In this framework , we also call for the discontinuation of all financial , technological and scientific aid used in developing Israels dangerous nuclear installations , which threaten not only the peace efforts and attempts to find a solution to the Palestine question and the Middle East problem , but also the security , stability and real interests of the peoples in the area and their natural , economic and environmental resources .  
First of all , an equitable international economic order should be established which did not blindly impose globalization on developing countries but instead included an equitable trading system , reform of the international financial institutions and a solution to the external debt problem .  
In its resolution 1338 ( 2001 ) , the Security Council requested detailed recommendations for a substantial international presence in East Timor after independence , developed in consultation with the East Timorese people and in coordination with the other relevant international and bilateral actors , in particular the international financial institutions and the United Nations funds and programmes .  
The Task Force is responsible for : ( a ) recommending initiatives or actions which will lead to the establishment of a common service or the reinforcement of an existing one ; ( b ) reviewing proposals and recommendations put forward by the working groups on common services ; and ( c ) defining the degree of commitment of cooperation , participation and human and financial resources required from participating organizations .  
The involvement of the League is expected to provide the needed political support to advance the objective of the UNDP regional programme on governance with emphasis on strengthening parliaments , supporting frameworks for financial transparency and accountability , improving the administration of justice and promoting human rights .  
Despite its own economic difficulties in the wake of the financial crisis in Asia , the Government had maintained its commitment to official development assistance ( ODA ) , which included cooperative programmes emphasizing local ownership and promoting human resources development in partnership with least developed countries . 
As stated earlier , with UNAMSIL currently being the largest peacekeeping operation , with projected human and material resources of over $ 700-million for the financial period 2001 / 02 , and in the light of the continued growth and complexity of the administrative and logistical support functions required of the Mission , it is of critical importance that the Director of Administration be a capable individual with a high level of competency and experience in meeting the progressively demanding administrative requirements of the Mission . 
As part of the rigid economic , financial and commercial blockade imposed on Cuba for more than 40 years , various actions have targeted our programme for the peaceful use of nuclear energy to prevent its advance .  
The ad hoc expert groups report ( A / 53 / 312 ) , including its conclusion that the global and regional financial institutions should play the lead role in assessing and addressing the economic consequences incurred by third States , had stimulated more focused thinking on the issues and , in particular , on the role of international organizations within and outside the United Nations system .  
On the subject of the environment and sustainable development , the Group of 77 and China were indeed pleased with the adoption at the first substantive session of the United Nations Forum on Forests of a multi-year programme of work and a plan of action .  They also wished to emphasize the necessity of providing the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification with adequate , predictable and stable financial resources .  
The problems created by globalization could provoke a genuine crisis of confidence among the worlds people as they saw poverty worsening , income unequally distributed within and among countries and international financial and commercial markets prey to instability at a time when the international community had never had such economic and technological means at its disposal .  
In addition to the loss of life and physical damage , international terrorism led to political instability , which was inimical to harmonious development of States , and made it necessary to devote huge human and financial resources to combating that scourge and eliminating its consequences .  
Emphasizes the need for technical and financial assistance to those developing countries working to achieve the elimination of traditional or customary practices affecting the health of women and girls from United Nations fund and programmes , international and regional financial institutions and bilateral and multilateral donors , as well as the need for assistance to non-governmental organizations and community-based groups active in this field from the international community ; 3 .  Calls upon all States :  
It was important to cooperate to find common solutions that would make it possible to reduce the vulnerability of the economies of the developing countries which was linked to the instability of external resources and inequitable access to private capital markets and to strengthen the world financial system so that it would serve the interests of all and lead to the attainment of the development goals established by the international community .  
The mobilization of additional resources , both domestic and foreign , was essential in order to achieve higher levels of growth and more effective poverty eradication ; private capital flows , and the promotion of trade , which would generate foreign capital , particularly in countries which had not been able to attract international financial flows , were equally important .  
It revealed , in particular , that without a coordinated global policy response , the slowing of the United States economy would produce a synchronous cyclical downturn in the world economy ; that on the eve of the events of 11 September , global economic conditions had already been deteriorating , and that for the first time since the end of the 1970s much of the world economy was simultaneously experiencing slower growth , because the major industrialized countries were exporting their recession through trade and financial linkages .  
While that view attracted some support , a concern was that mentioning governmental financial or economic support in a model legislative provision would be tantamount to recommending that support be given by the Government , a result that was considered inappropriate in respect of those Governments whose policy was not to grant any support for privately financed infrastructure projects .  
The view was expressed that model legislative provisions in respect of recommendations 46-48 should be drafted , since the issue of both collection of fees and other payments to be made to the concessionaire was crucial in respect of the financial balance of the project and the very notion of concession agreement and therefore needed to be addressed at a legislative rather than at a contractual level .

At the same time , during the " eighth five-year plan " period , the depth of opening to the outside world was unparalleled in history .  In the past , China 's opening has recently started to the outside world gave priority to commodity trade , introduction of technology , joint investment cooperatives , but it strives to scale high levels of introducing service , introducing operation methods of modern capital , etc . and has already begun to export capital overseas and even started participating in international financial operations .

For years in a row , China as a developing country has attracted the largest amount of foreign capital ; however , the number and scale of our transnational corporations are far smaller than those of developed countries ; at present , transnational mergers and acquisitions are concentrated mainly in the financial , insurance , telecommunications , aviation , automobile , and media fields , and our such fields have yet to be completely opened to the outside world because of their weak foundations .  
The structure of international capital has changed .  The traditional way of providing funds through banks is no longer a major financial practice .  At present , there are three different sources for obtaining funds - - direct foreign investment , bank loans , and credit market .  
Nowadays , with networks playing a growing role in the political , military , financial , communications , electric power , medical and health , and other fields , hackers ' sabotage activities are becoming increasingly rampant to pose a serious threat to economic order , social stability , and national security .  
Governors and managers at all levels within the financial sector not only are administrative leaders but also are responsible officials of the Party organization who not only need to do well their professional work but also need to stress on politics and the overall situation and consolidate ideological and political work , strengthen building contingents of cadres and workers , strengthen improving the Party �s work style and building a clean and honest government , and provide firm political guarantee for financial reform and development .  
Wen Jiabao suggested organizing all Party leading cadres to seriously study the important speech made by Comrade Jiang Zemin at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission , deeply carrying out the spirit of the plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission , working in line with the actual condition of the financial sector , setting up specific measures and taking practical actions to carry forward improving the Party �s work style and building a clean and honest government and fighting corruption within the financial sector .  
Article 1 .  These provisions are formulated in accordance with law , administrative laws and regulations , and other relevant state regulations in an effort to strictly enforce financial and economic discipline , strengthen the building of a clean and honest government , implement the " separation between revenue and expenditure " in managing administrative charges and revenues derived from fines and confiscated goods , and promote administration by law .  
( 1 ) All kinds of fees collected in accordance with law ; administrative laws and regulations ; relevant State Council regulations ; and rules and regulations jointly published by the financial and planning departments of the State Council ; as well as local laws and regulations promulgated by a province , an autonomous region , or a municipality ; rules and regulations promulgated by a provincial , regional , or municipal government ; and regulations jointly promulgated by the financial and planning ( commodity ) departments of a provincial , regional , or municipal people 's government ;  
Due to their weak foundation , serious shortages of capital and relative backward managerial skill , a large number of developing countries could not gain benefits from economic globalization , and the unequal international trade and financial management system further widened the gap between the South and the North .  
As S &amp; T have developed briskly throughout the world and economic structural adjustment has accelerated , and impacted by the Asian financial crisis , a certain international deflationary state has appeared .  This has also had a definite impact on China 's overall prices .  
So acting in the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 15th Central Committee and the Central Economic Work Conference , stressing the central link of state-owned enterprise [ SOE ] reform , and continuing to promote all reforms such as fiscal , financial , circulation , S &amp; T , education , housing , social security , and income distribution , will be crucial to clearing the system obstacles to promoting demand and improving supply , to establish the necessary system climate .  
Xiang stated : In 1999 , the Ministry of Finance also organized forces to launch a specialized examination on how specialized funds had been managed or spent , such as funds earmarked for national bonds , funds earmarked as subsidies for key flood control projects , funds earmarked for water conservancy works , and central financial funds earmarked for helping the poor ; adopted punitive measures to deal with exposed problems in a timely fashion ; and made public through the news media a number of typical cases .  
Zhang Changli 's case of illegally soliciting deposits from the public was an economic crime that severely violated the state financial administration system and disrupted the financial order , incurring enormous losses of state , collective , and personal property .  
Financial departments have actively implemented the series of principles and policies of the party Central Committee and the State Council and completed a great amount of work in deepening financial reform , rectifying the financial order , preventing and defusing financial risks , and supporting national economic development .  This way , they have played a very important role in strengthening and improving macro-control , supporting the reform of state-owned enterprises , and safeguarding social stability .  
Foreign capital and intermediate and long-term credit banks should be supported and encouraged to take part in the development and construction of the western regions , and efforts should be made to achieve breakthroughs in investment forms and operational modes in accordance with the methods for the management of foreign financial institutions .  
Positive efforts should be made to explore ways of providing financial services in support of the scientific and technological development and their popularization in the western regions , support infrastructure construction in key state-level hi-tech development zones as well as the production and circulation of hi-tech products , accelerate the technical transformation of competitive industrial enterprises in the western regions , and properly provide credit services to scientific research institutions in accordance with regulations .

We laid stress on investigating and supervising the use of special funds obtained from national debt , the large amount of central subsidies for flood prevention and water conservancy projects , the extra-budgetary funds of the central finance , central funds for assisting the poor areas , and funds for social security .  We investigated and handled a number of cases of violating financial and economic law , and disciplined those who were involved in such cases .  
Xiang noted that in light of the impact of the Asian financial crisis and domestic contradictions in scant effective demand in 1998 , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council made a resolute strategic decision to implement a proactive fiscal policy ; unceasingly stepped up policy efforts to expand the scope of the fiscal policy role ;  
On the other hand , Xiang Huaicheng added , the state has attached great importance to the issues of national debt and the size of the deficit ; strengthened fiscal capacity and the study of public risks ; strictly monitored the trend of fiscal operation ; prepared the necessary measures ; paid attention to precautions against fiscal risks ; reduced unnecessary expenses ; strove to control the size of the deficit ; improved policy means ; and enhanced the guiding and stimulating role of financial capital .  
We should increase our support of expenditures in the public welfare area to ensure that science and technology , education , social security , agriculture , ecological conservation , and other key areas and fields have the necessary funds to meet their expenditure needs .  We should increase our financial support for the establishment of a disaster prevention system , for projects designed to protect natural forests and to return grain plots to forestry , for poverty relief work , and for raising the peasants ' income .  
It is necessary to seriously sum up the experiences of practice , further perfect the relevant policies on reforming the grain circulation setup , and persist in wide-open purchase of the peasants ' surplus grain at protected prices ; at the same time , we should appropriately readjust the scope and relevant policies of purchasing grain at protected prices , so as to protect the peasants ' initiative in growing grain , promote restructuring of agricultural production , and reduce the state 's financial burden .  
and eliminate backward production techniques .  Meanwhile , the industrial enterprises in the urban areas should be relocated in an orderly fashion .  With regard to the tertiary industry , we should give priority to developing tourist , financial and insurance , real estate , and cultural industries , as well as network-based information service industries .  
As technological innovation is an important guarantee for enhancing competitiveness and achieving internationalization , Chinese household electrical appliance enterprises have not relaxed in technological innovation even for a moment after making it into the international market , investing massive human , material , and financial resources in technological innovation as well as marketizing , internationalizing , and commercializing it .  
Guo Zhenqian said the Financial and Economic Committee held that the 2000 central and local government budget arrangements have implemented the requirement for continued enforcement of a positive financial policy ; realized the spirit of readjusting structure , expanding domestic demand , ensuring main areas , promoting development , and maintaining stability ;  
paid attention to suppressing and saving general expenditure while practicing an positive financial policy ; striven to control the scale of financial deficit and debt ; and decreased the central government 's financial deficit compared with previous year when calculated in terms of comparable items .  
After last year 's central budget was approved , in the light of changes in the domestic and international situations , the party central committee and State Council decided to step up implementation of a positive financial policy .  
The Finance and Economic Committee is of the opinion that the central and local budgets for 2000 are in line with the requirement of continuing to implement a positive financial policy , and manifest the spirit of adjusting the economic structure , increasing domestic demand , assuring key expenditures , boosting development , and maintaining stability .  
The motions handled since the Second Session of the Ninth CPPCC National Committee , which are rich in content , have mainly included those aimed at maintaining sustained , rapid , and healthy national economic growth ; strengthening agriculture and doing a good job in rural work ; continually and energetically pressing ahead with the state-owned enterprise reform ; guarding against and alleviating the financial crisis ; expanding domestic demand ; continually implementing the principle of opening up to the outside world and vigorously opening up the international market ;  
In light of the situation in Yunnan , indeed , only by maintaining relatively rapid economic growth under the precondition of enhancing effectiveness can the enterprises ' difficulty in production and operation be mitigated , the pressure of employment be lessened , and the structural adjustment and in-depth reformed be promoted , so that financial revenue can be increased , financial risks be prevented , and social stability be maintained .  
Finally , the person in charge stressed : The personnel of the central bank must further improve the study of laws , and make sure that they study , be aware of , and understand the laws .  Not only should they know well the financial laws and regulations , they should also study relevant economic laws and regulations , and constantly enhance their level of administration according to law , so as to provide effective guarantee for promoting the stable development of the financial industry .  
One of major policies adopted at the meeting is to , in combination with the efforts of state-owned banks to handle their bad assets with concentrated efforts , introduce the practice of changing debt to equity by means of financial assets management companies and resolve the problem of an unduly high ratio of liabilities in a number of key state enterprises which have marketable products and enjoy sound development prospects , but have nevertheless landed in difficulty because of their unduly high ratio of liabilities .  
Drawing on the successful experiences of foreign countries , China has successively set up the four financial asset management companies of Xinda , Dongfang , Changcheng , and Huarong since last year .  By far , these companies have respectively purchased , operated , and handled the bad assets of the China Construction Bank , the Bank of China , the Agricultural Bank of China , and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China . This marks the formal start of the practice of changing debt into equity in the country .  
A responsible person of an authoritative state organ pointed out the other day : If the work of changing debt into equity is successfully conducted , it can provide a healthy financial foundation for state banks and state enterprises in China and can help prepare them for meeting competitions from both domestic and overseas markets .  However , if the work of changing debt into equity turns out to be a failure , we will be unable to attain the desired goal of this policy ;  
The outlay of the National Natural Sciences Foundation , in every field of natural science , has subsidized more than 40,000 projects in the more than ten years since 1986 .  In addition , recent financial support has seen a rather large increase , which has brought important functions into play , such as raising the level of the entire system of China 's basic scientific research ; promoting China 's scientific and technological innovation ;  
Hong Kong itself has an excellent environment for business operations , as demonstrated in its world-class commercial and financial services , the complete and efficient trade supplementary services , the modern infrastructure facilities , and the perfect system of rule by law ;  
Also through structural readjustment , the western region is expected to eliminate a batch of technical the backward small enterprises which pollute the environment ; and at the same time , the region should expand and reinforce those industries and enterprises which enjoy a sound competitiveness in the market and which can increase the financial sources of the region , so that they can become a pillar and a base for the rejuvenation and the development of the local economy .  
To improve its monetary policy-related work , the committee has , since 1999 , held meetings of economic and financial experts at regular intervals .  The purpose is to widely solicit opinions about the monetary policy from the academic community , study major issues on international and domestic economic and financial policies , and acquire suggestions from all sectors of society in an effort to improve its work related to the monetary policy .  
Accession to the WTO will be a major step in our country 's economic development strategy in the 21st century .  With the inevitable enhancement of foreign exchanges , there will be more intensive exchanges and movements of human , material , information , and financial resources .  
In order to actively promote the reform of the budget management system , establish a budget management system that fits the system of the socialist market economy , and bring about a scientific , institutionalized , and standardized system of budget management , as well as enhance the efficiency of using financial fund , the Ministry of Finance has decided to launch the work of reappraising fixed assets and circulating funds in 2000 for the administrative institutions and organizations under the jurisdiction of the central budget .  
criminal activities are on the rise in financial computer systems and e-commerce systems ; the CIH virus , BO hacker procedures , and other harmful databases have been spread far and wide .  Some hackers at home and abroad illegally intruded into information systems in important areas of China , attacking websites and stealing state or commercial secrets .  
We have persisted in implementing the strategy of rejuvenating the city on the strength of science and education , conscientiously placing education in the strategic position that gives top priority to educational development , and continuously increasing the financial input into education , so that a relatively complete educational system has been formed , and the 12-year education system has been made universal in the city five years ahead of schedule prescribed by the state .  
For many years we have worked hard to put into practice Deng Xiaoping 's thinking of common prosperity .  Having gained a certain economic strength , we began to carry out the " project of common prosperity " and , relying mainly upon the financial departments at the city level for many consecutive years , raised funds totaling 1.88-billion yuan and put them into the relatively backward areas of the city in a bid to improve their infrastructure facilities , industrial layout , and cultural and educational conditions , thereby bringing about the coordinated development of various localities .  
Being flexible and adaptable to changes , rich in international financial management experiences , and just out of the Asian financial storm , the people in the Hong Kong financial sector have grown more rational and more mature .  
makes information distorted and policy decisions wrong ; causes the waste of many human , material , and financial resources and precious time ; and enables the people to lose many rare chances for development .  
To relax the control of the capital account , it is first necessary to establish a flexible and effective financial macrocontrol mechanism .  To achieve this goal , the central bank must be able to select from many operating methods for regulating interest rates and foreign exchange rates .  
According to the latest statistics made by the People 's Bank of China , in the first quarter of this year , China 's banking and financial operations were normal and stable and showed a trend of positive development .  Continual increases in money supply and total credit met the need in expanding domestic demand , promoting production and the growth of consumption , and conformed in the main to the economic development .  The deposits of enterprises increased by a great extent , loans extended by financial institutions were expedited , and foreign exchange reserves increased steadily .  
If we only reckon up dead accounts , it will be very difficult to do a good job in fiscal work , and we may stifle it to death , which will have a direct impact on the economic and political results of financial expenditure , on economic and social development , and on the expansion of sources of finance and the strengthening of the state 's finances .  
Carrying out a positive fiscal policy , strengthening infrastructure construction , supporting agricultural basic construction and construction for the ecological environment , supporting economic restructuring , speeding up the development of hi-tech industry , revamping old industrial bases and traditional industries , practicing the policy of rejuvenating the nation through science and education and the strategy of sustainable development , and establishing a social security system all require corresponding increase of input and state financial support .  
In the course of economic globalization , floating capital is mainly controlled by the financial and business magnates of Western developed countries .  While the environment issue in Western countries has increasingly become a popular concern , to reap super profits , these magnates moved their enterprises that promise high profits but cause serious pollution to developing countries , thus sparking a global ecological crisis .  
The outgoing IMF managing director , Michel Camdessus , said : We have the opportunity to avoid financial crisis and narrow the wide gap between the rich and the poor that " may possibly cause an explosion " so that economic globalization will have human nature in a greater sense .  However , the premise for so doing is that the international economic structure must be commensurate with economic globalization and economic reform plans are widely supported by the populace .  
Second , reform has led to the monetization of economy and the deepening of finance , the former distribution in kind was gradually changed to distribution in money at real market prices ( the recent reform to suspend welfare housing distribution is an example ) , and the simple and unitary financial product previously provided by commercial banks has become complex and diversified .  
We should concentrate our manpower as well as financial and material resources on building a group of high-ranking academies and universities that have clear-cut military characteristics .  We should give priority to supporting a group of academic departments and laboratories that have utmost bearing on future wars .  These academic departments and laboratories will play a role as an initiator and demonstrator for all military academies .  
The key to Taiwan 's ability to maintain a relatively stable economic situation on the island under the financial crisis since July 1997 lies in the mainland 's stable economy , firm Renminbi , and vast consumer market , which have stabilized Taiwan 's trade with and investment in the mainland and thus stabilized Taiwan 's external trade to ensure normal functioning of the island 's economy .  
Moreover , China 's financial system is still not complete , and the capital market is not yet developed .  The enormous state-owned banking system is also not yet on the international track .  It will be frustrated for a long time to come in terms of an enormous bad capital problem .  
They also pointed out : Economic globalization has impacted the industries and domestic markets of developing countries that are in a " vulnerable positions " on differing degrees , and have greatly increased the risks of economic fluctuations and of triggering a financial crisis in a country .  Economic globalization has continuously widened the gap between the rich and the poor around the globe , and the economic sovereignty and independence of many countries have been tested .  
However , frequent international financial crises remind us that if the potential risks in the international balance of payments are not eliminated and dispelled in a timely manner , as soon as a serious imbalance occurs it will not only affect the economic and financial stability of a country , it will also jeopardize the basic interests of foreign investors .  
People will not forget that in the autumn of 1997 , the special administrative region government , which had just been set up , faced the impact of the financial crisis that wrecked havoc across Asia . The prices of securities in Hong Kong , whose pillar industries were the financial business and real estate , plummeted and the prices of houses also fell drastically , causing the economy as a whole to decline .  
While people were sighing in despair , the special administration region government took drastic measures on its own initiative to strengthen the linked exchange rate system , drove international speculators out of Hong Kong , and stabilized the securities market and financial market , thus proving the pessimistic predictions of some people to be untrue .  
In 1986 , Qingdao started to openly select and appoint the deputy directors of its planning commission , economic commission and financial committee .  In 1993 , it selected deputy administrators and assistants from applicants all over the country for its five departments including the city 's science and technology commission , bureau for tourism , and high-tech industrial park .  In 1999 , it had selected and appointed six leading cadres at the deputy bureau chief level from applicants in the whole city .  
Since large enterprises are not required to exercise the function of bearing the financial burden in supporting social undertakings , the surplus personnel they released have to be digested by small and medium-sized enterprises .  Many new service sectors , such as service units in cities and towns as well as community services , have also relied on the support of small and medium-sized enterprises .  As a developing and rising group , small and medium-sized enterprises have started to show their vitality .  
The final statement and action program adopted by the first Southern Ministerial Meeting called for the establishment of a fair and rational international economic order , reform of the irrational international financial system and the unequal international trade system , and for the UN to play a leading role in the economic affairs of the world so that the developing countries would be able to participate more in global economic decisions .  
Like their civilian counterparts , the legal affairs that military lawyers have to handle involve those relevant to criminal , civil , economic , administrative , maritime , and financial laws , and so they must be totally familiar with the laws and regulations of the country so that they can properly handle the legal affairs in the armed forces and legal affairs that involve both military and civilian departments ;  
It is necessary to integrate education with management and punishment .  In view of the special feature that the financial sector has more economic crimes than any other sectors and through the establishment of three defensive lines of ideology , system , and law , the financial sector should coordinate its regular ideological education with strict management and its efforts to strictly crack crimes , so as to form an education-management-crackdown structure .  
This regiment was equipped with certain advanced anti-tank self-propelled guns and anti-tank missiles , but some battalions and companies failed to concentrate their main energies on the development and application of the property of the new equipment and the mastery of weapons in hand .  Instead , they put a lot of financial , material and human resources into learning English and microcomputer technology , and making multi-media software .  All battalions and companies of this regiment reported more than 30 science-technology military training achievements to the regiment in a year .  
The Asian financial crisis has given us a practical lesson .  Financial security is no longer a pure economic issue .  It has a bearing on the political and social security of a country and is part and parcel of national security .  
Currently we regulate and control the money supply mainly by controlling the total credit of state-owned commercial banks and we have not yet adopted indirect regulation and control means in real terms in this regard .  After China enters the WTO , changes in money supply and swings in interests in international markets will have a direct impact on China 's domestic financial market and money supply and they will make it more difficult to regulate and control money supply .  Consequently , China 's existing macroscopic financial regulation and control will face challenges .  
Moreover , our country 's financial supervisory departments have not yet indirectly controlled and regulated domestic financial supervision in real terms and established an effective supervisory system .  
In regulating the money supply , the central bank must explore ways to rationally control money supply at all levels in the new financial environment through multiple forms of indirect regulation and control , such as open market operation , deposited reserve , rediscounts , interest rates , and special deposits , and promote a timely transition from direct to indirect regulation and control .  
We must strengthen cooperation between the central bank and other financial supervisory departments , make supervision more efficient , financial supervision more effective , and the financial sector more transparent , and establish a perfect financial supervisory organization and institutional system .  
During the " 10th Five-Year Plan " , the province should remarkably increase the proportion of the non-public sector in its entire economy and should build this sector into a strong motive force to speed up economic growth and employ the jobless in society and into an unexhausted source to increase financial revenues as well as incomes of urban and rural residents .  
Just as some economists have analyzed , through the practice of proactive financial policies , China has withstood the impacts of the Asian financial crisis , achieved the sustained and relatively rapid national economic growth , created favorable conditions for promoting reform , exploiting the existing production capability , mitigating the contradiction with regard to employment , and maintaining social stability , and concentrated its energies on constructing a number of infrastructure facilities and accomplishing some major projects which were intended , but were unable , to be carried out for years .  
During the early period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , in the light of the outstanding issues in the economic life , containing inflation was regarded as the priority task of macroeconomic control and moderately tight financial and monetary policies were implemented , and measures for comprehensive control were adopted , thus reversing the situation of high inflation .  Under the circumstance of still maintaining a relatively high level of economic growth rate , the soaring prices have returned to a relatively low level , thus the national economy smoothly realizing a " soft landing . "  
Since 1997 , with reference to those issues like the Asian financial crisis , insufficient effective domestic demands , and so on , active financial policies and firm and steady monetary policies were implemented .  Through issuing national debts , expanding investments , promoting consumption , and increasing exports , the deflation development tendency has been effectively stopped .  
During the period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , the historical opportunity of expanding domestic demands and implementing active financial policies was seized .  Through issuing national debt and expanding investments , we have concentrated efforts to build a batch of major projects and fulfilled some big projects which we had always wanted to fulfill but failed .  The agricultural , forestry , and water conservancy construction has noticeably quickened .  
In the face of the new situation , new state of affairs , and new issues , we have timely readjusted those moderately tight financial policies and monetary policies into actively financial policies and steady and safe monetary policies and coordinately applied various means to regulate and control economic operations .  We have both increased investment in infrastructure construction and supported the technical renovation of enterprises .  
For the purpose of curbing deflation and expanding domestic demand , the implementation of a positive financial policy was consistently combined with the implementation of a moderate and stable monetary policy .  While efforts were made to promote economic growth , attention was also paid to keeping the smooth and stable operation of the economy .  
On this point , Xu Simin raised his voice : " First , during the crucial period when the Asian financial crisis was riding roughshod over Hong Kong , the SAR Government used its foreign exchange reserve to invest in the stock market , repelling the huge international financial speculators and preserving Hong Kong 's financial stability .  
In the provinces and cities along the eastern coast and in the prefectures and counties where secondary and tertiary industries are developed , the financial resources are fairly strong , so there should not be a problem , but in the midwestern provincial areas - - particularly the prefectures and counties which are centered around agriculture - - what will be done about the fiscal shortfalls left after change from fees to taxes in the rural areas ?  
In cases in which counties and villages ( towns ) are really hard pressed financially once fees are replaced with taxes , the financial authorities at the national and provincial levels should shift sufficient funds to ensure that this major reform goes forward smoothly .  
To ensure sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development in Tibet , the party Central Committee has adopted eight major preferential policies for the region , including fiscal , financial , investment , foreign trade , as well as agricultural , animal-husbandry , and rural policies .  
APEC should make great efforts to promote economic and technological cooperation and add new dimensions to such cooperation .  In addition , based on the lessons learned from the financial crisis , it should further enhance macroeconomic coordination among its members .  The meeting of finance ministers should serve as a major mechanism for its member economies to exchange views on the economic situation , publish important economy-guiding information , and coordinate economic-development policies .  Similarly , work should be done to make the meeting of central bank governors a mechanism for coordinating banking activities .  
Examples are building early-warning and preventive mechanisms , forming an APEC financial early-warning group ( composed of finance ministers of major economies and financial experts ) , enhancing macroeconomic coordination , establishing emergency financial assistance mechanisms , enacting APEC rules for financial activities , supervising the flow of large amounts of capital in the region , and setting up financial personnel training organizations to raise the financial operational and management ability of developing economies .  
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , Xiamen 's gross national product roseby 16.6 percent on an annual average and the city 's GNP and financial revenue also ranked the first among all special economic zones .  
and has ensured that the financial system will remain stable .  The government has also shown unreserved concern for the problem of unemployment , which was left over from history , by helping unemployed workers find jobs or tackle problems in livelihood .  The government has joined hands with social forces in introducing a variety of training activities and in opening up new employment channels and this has helped check a rising unemployment rate and ease up the unemployment situation .  
Through reforms and opening up over more than 20 years , Guangzhou has given play to many of its traditional commercial advantages and has gradually built up a mature market system , laid a good industrial foundation , built up its financial strength , and improved its investment environment and investment management .  
All Tthese reform all conform to the objective rules of the military 's economic administration under the socialist market economy , and meet the requirements of the national financial reform .  The implementation of these measures will substantially improve the scientific nature of the military spending budget administration and more fullyer allow the military spending budget-making to work as a macro-adjustment and control in our military modernization construction .  
Party committees at all levels should use Chairman Jiang 's important directives on the financial work and the decision made by the Central Military Commission to unite thinking .  They should , from the strategic perspective of the overall situation , clearly understand the great significance of the the military 's budget-making reform , understand relevant policies and regulations , hold the correct attitude towards a possible adjustment of regional interests , and implement the decision made by Chairman Jiang and the Central Military Commission in a resolute and solid manner .  
The implementation of the proactive financial policy not only has effectively controlled the total supply and demand in the immediate economy but also greatly pushed forward the adjustment of economic structure .  It has alleviated the " bottleneck " restraint of economic development , thus accumulating reserve strength for sustained and stable economic growth .  
As a result , there is a more reliable guarantee for the resource of funds to pay the interests of treasury bonds .  Particularly , with the expansion of China 's economic aggregates , the increase of the quality of economic growth , and further deepening of its financial and taxation systems , China has increasingly strengthened its financial ability to pay back its debts .  The state has an absolute ability to pay back its matured treasury bonds without causing a debt crisis .  
Dai Xianglong said : Deepening the reform of wholly state-owned commercial banks is key to the reform of China 's financial system .  In the next five years or so , China 's four commercial banks that are wholly owned by the state should be reformed into modern , large-scale commercial banks that are quite competitive in international financial markets .  
At the same time , comprehensive auditing will be conducted and strengthened in the fields of budgetary management , equipment , capital construction , reform items , and the enforcement of economic and financial discipline .  The internal auditing institutions will be improved and reinforced .  Efforts will be made to build a high-quality contingent of auditors who work honestly , diligently , and efficiently .  
The Chinese Government has also revised the " Law on Regional Autonomy of Ethnic Groups , " adopted more policies for providing necessary preferential and favored treatments in the financial , monetary , taxation , and foreign trade aspects for areas exercising regional autonomy of ethnic groups , and provided a legal guarantee for the great development of the western areas .  
In recent years the pace of development in China 's eastern region has caused people to look at it with new respect , while the Japanese economy is facing structural contradictions .  Added to these are the Asian financial crisis , the growing amount of bad assets held by banks , the sluggish progress of economic recovery , and worsening fiscal difficulties .  
We must improve the administrative structures of legal entities in state-owned commercial banks , appoint supervisory councils , establish supervisory mechanisms in accord with the market economy , set up business associations in various financial sectors , and implement prudent accounting systems in conformity with international practices .  
their internal system of rules and regulations is inadequate , their financial management is in chaos , their products are of poor quality , and their material and energy consumption is high .  They are marked by rampant tax fraud and evasion , theft and wastefulness , lack of safety measures , and reckless environmental pollution and other problems .  
Especially at a time when the country is engaged in launching the important reform projects of building a socialist market economic system and restructuring the financial and tax policies , the ministry has taken the initiative in supporting and guiding Tibet 's financial reforms in accordance with Tibet 's actual situation .  
First , with regard to assuring the requirements of monetary policy and financial supervision and control and raising the level at which duties and responsibilities are carried out according to law , the bank has established scientific , highly effective systems for financial statistics and for off-site management and control . 
Plus its inexperience in administration and its confused and ambiguous financial , economic , environmental protection , and social welfare policies , all caused the worsening of the investment environment and forced a large number of enterprises to close down or move out of Taiwan .  
In addition to the ongoing economic restructuring and the changes in the external economic environment , the worsening economic situation in Taiwan was mainly caused by the turbulent political situation , the confused financial and economic policies , the uncertainty in cross-strait relations , and the shaken confidence among the people after the new government took power .  In this sense , it can be considered as a consequence of the change in the authorities in Taiwan .  
Dai Xianglong analyzed and said that the breakout of the Asian financial crisis had not only internal factors , but also many external factors .  After the Asian financial crisis , various Asian countries intensified their in-depth structural adjustments and financial reorganization , handled bad assets , lowered the debt rates of the enterprises , directly or indirectly promoted economic recovery and growth , and basically maintained the stability of financial operation .  
tax evasion , tax fraud , foreign exchange fraud , and smuggling activities have continued despite repeated attempts to prohibit them ; the phenomena of commercial fraud and debt evasion are becoming increasingly serious ; false financial statements and other behavior that violates financial and economic discipline are quite common ;  
Since these training exercises , be they staged on a map , on a computer in a simulated manner , or with real arms and real men , often involve a large amount of financial and human resources and organizational efforts , we should study ways of fully developing their exemplary or guiding roles for our teaching and training work ;  
Dai Xianglong , governor of the People 's Bank of China who is attending the Fortune Global Forum 2001 in Hong Kong , said today that when facing the slowdown of the world economic growth , China will continue to carry out its positive financial policy and moderate and prudent monetary policy , extensively open domestic markets , continue to increase its foreign exchange reserve , and continue to maintain the stability of the Renminbi exchange rates .  
After developing into an international financial center , with its freely convertible currency , a sound legal system , an environment for fair competition , and the tariff-free advantage , Hong Kong 's free economy will attain further development . 
According to the experts attending the seminar from home and abroad while summing up the successful experience in the operation of China 's monetary policies over the past few years , there are some essential characteristics as follows : First , the principle of moderation has been adhered to , that is , the stabilization of currency value has been taken as the most important objective and the relationship between the prevention of financial risks and economic growth has been correctly handled ;  
Dai Xianglong pointed out that , after the Asian financial crisis of 1997 , the various countries of Asia learned a lesson , adopting realistic and feasible adjustment measures , intensifying their underlying readjustments and financial reorganization efforts , disposing of bad assets , lowering enterprise debt-equity ratios , and promoting economic recovery and growth , so financial operations have been basically stable .  
Dai emphasized that , faced with the current slowdown in world economic development , China 's membership in the WTO will mean that China 's economic and financial markets will be fully opened , which will benefit the further deepening of regional economic cooperation in Asia , as well as injecting new vitality into global economic and financial cooperation .  
Contradictions in various strata in Hong Kong should be resolved through mutual understanding and accommodation after consultation and discussion .  Sensational means should not be used to intensify contradictions .  Seeking development means creating conditions for " gathering talent and financial resources , " actively promoting industrial and education restructuring , and maintaining Hong Kong 's competitive edge at the advent of the era of global economic integration and knowledge-based economy .  
Through practicing macroeconomic regulation and control measures , with the focus on expansionist fiscal policy , in the past three years China has successfully withstood the blow of the Asian financial crisis and maintained the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
She hoped that all relevant ministries and state commissions make further effort , guarantee the smooth operation of the existing work mechanisms , and further strengthen cooperation among the customs , financial , monetary , taxation , and quality inspection departments , continue to implement the current supportive and encouraging policies and measures , and ensure the smooth development of the work of promoting trade with science and technology .  
Some countries that were affected by the 1997 financial crisis have learned experience and a lesson from the financial crisis , and , therefore , in recovering their economies , have placed greater importance on adopting a macroeconomic policy tailored to meet the actual situations .  The current ADB annual meeting also stressed the need to assist developing countries to carry out economic restructuring , enhance their macroeconomic regulation and control ability , and build and refine a social security system , in order to ensure relatively high economic growth in this region .  
The continuous growth of the tax revenue has contributed significantly to the increased financial strength of various levels of government , effective implementation of the proactive fiscal policy , and the sustained , fast , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Li Changchun and his party had earlier visited Mumbai , India 's western financial and commercial city , and Hyderabad , a newly emerging science and technology city in southern India . In Mumbai , Li Changchun attended a Guangdong-Indian economic and technology trade fair .  
However , the United States now tries to hold " across-the-board superiority " and guarantees its " absolute security " on the basis of the swelling hegemonic mentality supported by its unparalleled power after the end of the Cold War and the rich financial resources accumulated by the sustained economic growth in recent years .  
Over the past year , Taiwan 's stock market has fallen tremendously , foreign investment has shrunken , financial crises are lurking , a large number of businesses have gone bankrupt or moved away , and the rate of unemployment is rising steadily .  Forty percent of the people who supported A-Bian in the past say that they will not vote for him again .  
Under the tidal wave of economic globalization , in order to become a financial and service center , Hong Kong must have a vast economic hinterland , an extensive commercial network , the richest business information in Asia , and a large number of qualified personnel ready to provide services to international investors .  
Professor Yin Naiping of Taiwan National Chengchi University held : Taiwan could not control some of the factors that contributed to its current economic , financial , and banking difficulties , for example , international economic recession and burdens left behind from the past .  However , we could not deny that due to their incompetent administration , Taiwan authorities have created additional problems , inappropriately handled problems left behind from the past , and further aggravated Taiwan 's economy .  
Professor Yin Nai-ping of Taiwan 's National Chengchi University held that there are some uncontrollable factors in Taiwan 's economic , fiscal , and financial problems .  For example , the international economic recession and burdens left over by the previous government .  
The " prescriptions " written by people of insight on the island include pursuing political stability , promoting industrial upgrade , raising administrative efficiency , and promoting financial reforms .  However , they spontaneously stressed the crucial role of developing cross-strait relations .  Some scholars pointed out that the authorities ' " no haste , be patient " policy has led people to lose hope .  
There are two reasons why the United States has decided to give up its strategy of " winning two local wars breaking out simultaneously . "  First , the United States has been feeling that its military strength and transport capability are inadequate and its financial resources are insufficient , making it difficult to continue to hit others using two fists at the same time .  
The European Parliament highly values the correct position adopted by China in the Asian financial crisis a few years ago , and is glad to see that China has made great achievements in its socialist modernization and in maintaining social stability , and enabling its people to live and work happily and peacefully .  It is willing to make joint efforts with the Chinese side in strengthening cooperation in the political , economic , trade , and financial fields , and make greater efforts to advance the comprehensive development of European-Chinese relations .  
Shan Jie has also spared no effort to mobilize the local masses to collect and purchase Wulingzhi , Yizhihao , Hongjingtian , and other natural medicinal herbs which grow on the plateau , and has set up Tibet Kangda Medicines Company Ltd . as the first " joint venture enterprise on the plateau . "  As a result , the county 's annual financial revenue has risen by 6 million yuan .  
Over the past few years , in order to seek the status as a so-called " independent political entity " in the international arena , the Taiwan authorities , in the name of expanding " international living space , " have devoted massive manpower and material and financial resources to pursuing " money diplomacy . "  
In fact , since the start of the ASEM 's cooperation mechanism , member countries have conducted extensive cooperation and exchanges in many areas .  In addition to economic , trade , and financial cooperation , Asia and Europe have launched political dialogues , cultural forums , and scientific and technological cooperation .

Xiang Huaicheng told Chinese reporters in an exclusive interview that during their visit to Germany , China and Germany completely agreed that both countries shared an extensive consensus on many major international financial and monetary issues ; and the two countries should continue stepping up cooperation in multilateral international institutions and forums , including the IMF , the World Bank , as well as the 20-Nation Group and the Asian-European Financial Ministers ' Conference . Meanwhile , the two countries should also further expand mutual financial and economic exchanges .  
Speaking of their visit in France , Xiang Huaicheng indicated that he and French Financial Minister Laurent Fabius had held a fruitful meeting at which they discussed ways to strengthen mutual financial and monetary cooperation , and exchanged views , and reached an extensive consensus , on many issues , including the international macroeconomic situation , social security issues , and multilateral and regional cooperation .  
Xiang Huaicheng said : " The fact that China is strengthening its financial and monetary exchange and cooperation with Germany and France is not only conducive to a smooth development in the friendly relations of our two sides ; but is all the more significant to promoting coordination between advanced countries and developing countries against the background of an economic globalization , to maintaining a stable global macroeconomic situation with joint efforts , and to establishing a rational international monetary framework as well as global economic rules .

Beijing Municipal CPC Committee and Government leaders , including Jia Qinglin , fully reaffirmed the public security organs ' special campaigns and public order rectification work that mainly aimed to crack down on criminal underworld and evil elements , and that also aimed to severely crack down on serious violent crimes , repeated financial crimes , neighborhood crimes , and drug-related crimes .  
In the wake of the gradual deepening of China 's market-oriented reform of the foreign currency interest rates , its foreign currency interest rates are no longer shut in their own closed environment and are instead linking tracks with the international financial community ; they are following international practices and rules and regulations to increasingly move up and down in sync with the international interest rates .  The characteristics of internationalization and conformity are becoming more clear with each passing day .  
Since the beginning of the second half of 2000 , the economies of some APEC developed members have undergone major readjustments ; economic growth has remarkably slowed down ; the demand of the global information technology and electronic industry has been sluggish , and the financial market unstable ; export has begun to slow down ; and trade protectionism has raised its head .  These trends will bring about some uncertainties to APEC economic cooperation .  
Due to the continuous decline and notable shrink in the transactions of Taipei 's stock market in the previous week , the influence of the upcoming PLA military exercise on Dongshan Island , and the upcoming publication of the various industries ' business income in May , electronic shares did not perform well on 4 June , and Taipei 's stock market opened low and remained low .  Except for financial shares , which registered growth thanks to the support of specific funds , all shares declined .  
Speaking at a recent symposium on financial and economic affairs , Central Bank Vice Governor Chen Shih-meng mentioned that , at the recent International Monetary Fund meeting he attended , many foreign businessmen maintained that they believed the Chinese Mainland would become the biggest market in the future , but that , owing to political and cultural factors , they had problems gaining direct access .  
Now , financial and economic officials , while continuing to uphold the " no haste , be patient " policy , have pledged that Taiwan " will become a center , not a springboard " .  How can they expect to rebuild the people 's confidence with the slogan that they will " work desperately hard for the economy " when their basic logics for regional economy are self-contradictory ?  
However , since he took office , he has failed to honor his commitment .  To consolidate his political base , he has been blindly playing up to the interests of the conservative forces , the rich , and large enterprises , especially of the military industrial enterprises , in the financial budget and taxation policy , education policy , social security policy , environment policy , and on a series of other issues .  
The central government should strengthen across-the-board management and guidance for basic education , and should transfer more financial resources to the areas with difficulties and the areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups in the central and western parts of the country according to the actual conditions , thus supporting the development of basic education in these areas .  
Putin 's strategic target of rejuvenating Russia , restoring Russia 's prestige as a big power , and turning Russia into a major polar in today 's multipolar world tallies with the mentality and the aspirations of the Russian people ; with the addition of the remarkable results that he has already attained in boosting the country 's economic , financial , and agricultural development and in increasing the public 's income , Putin is now enjoying a strong backing at home . 
In the face of a drastic change in the world 's pattern , as well as heavy and arduous reform tasks , our party judged the hour and sized up the situation , made wise policy decisions , eliminated all kinds of interference , properly handled a series of major and complicated issues , withstood the buffet caused by the Asian financial crisis , overcame the historically unprecedented floods , and succeeded in maintaining a sustained , rapid and sound economic development .  
As a result of implementation in the past six years of this guiding principle for the work in Tibet in the new period , the whole region 's social situation has stabilized , rate of economic growth has increased remarkably , efforts in reform and opening up have gradually picked up , construction of infrastructure facilities including that of energy , transportation and communication has developed fairly fast , local financial revenues have registered a relatively greater increase , and the people 's livelihood has clearly improved .  
Some economists of China hold the view that the adverse influence of the decrease in exports on China 's economy has begun to show , but as long as we expand domestic total demand and implement the proactive financial policy and the steady currency policy , we will be able to sustain the stable growth , and there will be no need to adopt the policy of stimulating exports and the economy by appropriately devaluing renminbi .  
The Chinese Government will continue to carry out its vigorous financial policy and its steady currency policy in 2001 , and will steadily promote economic structural adjustment and its western development strategy , so the domestic economy will maintain steady and continuous growth .  
The Asian financial crisis unexpectedly broke out in 1997 and brought serious impacts to our neighboring countries and regions .  The party Central Committee judged the hour and sized up the situation and timely worked out a series of measures to regulate the macro-economy , thus ensuring the steady development of our foreign export trade and foreign capital inflows despite the unfavorable international economic environment .  
Investment by the state and financial aid from the central government are primarily used for the construction of relevant facilities in farming and animal husbandry industries , infrastructure , scientific and technological education and political power at the grass-roots levels , as well as protection and construction of the ecological environment , all with stress on solving " bottleneck " and prominent difficulties restricting the development of Tibet .  
The fifth is to establish a perfect rural market economic system and insurance system , draw up rules and regulations for the transactions of agricultural products , and promote the setting up of a pluralistic rural capital market in which agricultural policy banks , rural cooperative banks , commercial banks , and other nongovernmental financial organizations exist side by side .  
We should do so by starting with leaders in various financial institutions .  We should uphold healthy trends , develop new practices , enhance institutional initiative and creativity , and carry out to the letter , the decisions of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council . We should make fresh , and greater contributions , through pushing forward a financial reform , rectifying financial order , stepping up financial supervision and control , and heightening operational efficiency , and should guard against and alleviate financial risks , and support national economic development as well .  
During the Ninth FYP , faced with the dual pressure of the Asian financial crisis and insufficient effective domestic demand , China further expanded the fields and scale of utilization of foreign investment while practicing a proactive fiscal policy and making efforts to increase domestic demand , and such utilization played an important stimulating role .  
This is a wise choice based on our national condition ; it has enabled us , when regional and world economic turbulence occur , to successfully guard against financial risks , avoid huge losses , and safeguard national economic security .  
If administrative examination and approval can be replaced with the market mechanisms , then administrative interference should be stopped .  If administrative examination and approval is indeed needed , then it must be done according to regular procedures with intermediate links being reduced and with results being made public so that the use of power can be subject to supervision and check-and-balance .  The reform of the financial system should be carried on .  
financial fraud and violations of fiscal and economic discipline are widespread ; there is fraud and deception in tendering for construction projects , and the quality of some projects is inferior ; the cultural markets are chaotic ; and major and serious safety accidents occur from time to time in production operations .  Some new characteristics have recently emerged in illegal activities , such as crimes being committed by syndicates , transregional crimes , crimes committed by collusion between outside and inside , specialized crime , and intellectualized crime .  
In earmarking billions of yuan for the improvement of the urban environment in spite of a relative shortage of overall financial resources , Guangzhou 's fundamental starting point is that , as General Secretary Jiang noted , " the continuous development of advanced productive forces and advanced culture is essentially to meet the growing material and cultural needs of the masses and to continuously realize the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the people . "  
China 's healthy and steady economic growth over many years is an expression of the state 's unswerving implementation of correct economic policies , including the active fiscal policy , reform of state enterprises , reform of the financial setup , reform of grain circulation , reform of the social security system , and economic restructuring , which is listed as the focal point in work this year .  
For instance , gratifying changes have emerged in the problem of commercial banks ' bad debts , which had been regarded as a " time bomb " by many financial experts at home and abroad : The central bank has announced that the rate of bad debts of state-owned commercial banks has started to fall since the fourth quarter of last year , and on average it dropped by 2.1 percentage points during the first six months of this year .  
According to the latest statistics released by the People 's Bank of China , the country 's moderate fiscal policy has yielded desired results , and the country 's stable and healthy financial conditions during the first half of this year have proved to be strong support for both its economic restructuring and its sustained national economic growth .  
In the last few years , as China 's economy has developed rapidly , bad assets , extending loans in violation of established regulations , financial fraud , losses of state-owned assets , and other problems related to Chinese banks , insurance companies , and other financial institutions have cropped up one after another , seriously compromising healthy development of China 's financial industry and economy and becoming an economic tumor in the country .  
If a county indeed has difficulties in funding teachers ' wages due to insufficient financial resources , the problem should be solved by readjusting expenditure structure and by increasing central fiscal transfer payment to local authorities .  The increase of teachers ' income should absolutely not be done by raising the taxtbook fee and miscellaneous fee .  
According to state regulations , county-level financial departments should pay wages directly to teachers on regular payrolls .  As to the counties without sufficient financial resources and with actual difficulties in paying wages to teachers , problems in this area should be resolved through readjustment of the expenditure structure and in the way to increase transfer payments between central and local revenues .  
At the National Audit Working Forum held here today , Li Jinhua , auditor-general of the National Audit Office , said that since the " Audit Law " was promulgated six years ago , budget execution audit has played a positive role in safeguarding the financial and economic order , driving the reform of the fiscal system , reinforcing budget management , promoting administration by law , and strengthening the building of clean and honest administration .  
This meeting is a concrete embodiment of our efforts to implement the gist of both the State Council work conference on rectifying and regulating the market economic order and the national work conference on public security ; is an important move that aims to rectify the country 's financial order , as well as guard against and avert financial risks ; and is also a general modernization order and a general work plan on launching a special campaign in key areas against the manufacturing and sales of counterfeit currencies .  
put an end to the rampant manufacturing and sales of counterfeit currencies in a number of areas ; successfully checked the sudden growth in the amount of counterfeit currencies ; and has played an important part in maintaining a stable economic , financial , and social order , and in promoting the healthy growth of the socialist market economy .  
The after-effects of the financial crisis still exist in certain countries in varying degrees , resulting in political turmoil and conspicuous ethnic , religious , and other social contradictions , seriously affecting the confidence of domestic and foreign investors .  
In order to further improve the global development environment , the developing and the developed countries should continue to promote reforms in the international financial setup , launch a new round of WTO trade negotiations , narrow the development gap between the developing and the developed countries , and work together to build a more fair and rational new international economic order .  
We upheld the comprehensive management of earth resources , and the comprehensive development of agriculture , forestry , animal husbandry and semi-aquatics .  In regard to inputs of manpower , financial power , material resources , and science and technology , we realized the integrated raising of agricultural economic efficiency , ecological efficiency , and social efficiency .  
Through intensified reform and system innovation , we should continuously make administrative affairs more transparent , improve management and supervision of personnel , financial , and material resources , and improve the work mechanism that opposes corruption and advocates honesty , so that economic crimes and corrupt phenomena can be timely discovered , effectively prevented , and strictly punished .  
The old international economic order was a product of the imperialist colonial age , including an international production system with irrational international division of labor as its basis , a capitalist international trade system with the exchange of unequal value as its basis , and a capitalist monetary and financial system with monopoly as its basis .  
At meetings in Beidaihe , the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee specifically discussed problems China would face after joining the WTO . The Political Bureau has decided to set up a WTO-accession financial and fiscal work leading group .  Led by Wen Jiabao , vice premier of the State Council , the leading group will call a national financial and fiscal work meeting in November . The objective of the leading group is to " revamp financial order , perfect the exchange-rate mechanism , regulate the capital market , and improve personnel proficiency . "  
It was learned that the leading group led by Wen Jiabao is drafting a report on China 's financial and fiscal structure after the WTO accession .  The report will give a comprehensive assessment of China 's financial and fiscal situations in terms of legal system , organization , operation , and personnel , and propose countermeasures for a series of problems China will face after its entry to the WTO , such as capital drain , unhealthy competition in the credit market , and risks arising from international speculative activities in the stock market .  
The Chinese Government will set up special organizations in the newly established financial supervision bureau of the People 's Bank of China and in the new regulatory bureau of the Securities Regulatory Commission , in order to regulate investments by foreign funds and the flow of such funds on the mainland , thereby preventing financial turmoil caused by huge fluctuations in the flow of international investment funds .  
China is now in a period of economic structural transformation , during which the rules governing the planned economy are being smashed while the rules governing the socialist market economy remain imperfect .  Under such circumstances , financial loopholes , violations of the financial law and discipline , and government corruption are inevitable .  
As for topic on banking , it will include the positioning of policy-related banks , the consolidation of rural credit cooperatives , how to digest bad debts by asset management companies , market-oriented interest rates , foreign exchange control , further resolving contradictions in the current financial operation , and continuing to solve problems which remain unsolved .  
Despite China 's rather strict control over the media industry and the many obstacles foreign capital is bound to encounter in accession , covetous foreign financial groups , started from the periphery , have already sought ways to establish ties with the media inside China through various channel and gradually infiltrated into this fertile land of media industry .  
Following the continuous implementation of the proactive fiscal policy in depth , China had witnessed a major turnaround in economic development in 2000 .  The annual GDP grew 8 percent in 2000 .  The state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises had notably improved their economic performances .  China had basically achieved its goal to lift difficult enterprises out of their economic trouble .  Its exports increased by 28 percent and fiscal revenues reached 1.338-trillion yuan , a growth of 193.6-billion yuan over that in 1999 .  Its financial operation remained stable .  
Governments at all levels should show deep care for the people , always care about the well-being of the working masses living in difficult conditions , fully rely on the masses , rely on the community management organizations , do careful and meticulous work , find out the concrete conditions of the people living in difficult conditions , effectively arrange the necessary funds needed by the issuance of minimum livelihood allowances through adjusting the structure of financial revenue and expenditure .  
During the current visit , the NAV delegation has specially studied China 's construction of the Three Gorges Project and held discussions and exchanged views with the NPC financial and economic committee , the State Council 's Three Gorges Project Construction Committee , the Ministry of Water Resources and the Power Corporation . We are willing to carry out active exchanges and cooperation with our Vietnamese comrades in economic construction and to further and constantly enhance the traditional friendship between the two peoples .  
China 's economic strength , particularly the foreign economic balancing ability , has been substantially enhanced in the 20 years of development , so that China is capable of accepting such a challenge as opening its financial sector to the outside world , and is powerful enough to maintain a stable currency value .  
At a briefing to Chinese and foreign reporters today , Liu Hong , director of the State Statistics Bureau , said : In 1999 , China 's economy grew steadily ; the residents ' living standards continued to improve ; the financial , securities , and insurance industries were continuously standardized and developed ; social undertakings made new advances ; and environmental protection was further strengthened .  
In relevant reports , it also will be announced that a positive financial policy will be implemented this year - - the third consecutive year .  By issuing treasury bonds , the state will make financial investments to increase domestic demand and ensure economic growth .  
On its economic and social fronts , China successfully met its preset targets for economic growth , its exports ceased to fall and began to pick up , its financial revenue enjoyed a stable growth , an increase was registered in the economic returns of state enterprises , and the living standards of the people are undergoing a continued improvement .  All these were remarkable work results that had attracted people 's attention .  
On the major legislative activities at present , Zeng Jianhui said : We are mainly studying in earnest the revision of the Company Law , pushing forward the drafting of the Social Security Law , strengthening legislation in the areas of science and education , drawing up and revising laws pertaining to the financial services industry and international economic relations and trade , and paying close attention to drafting the Supervision Law .  
Banking , financial and taxation , customs , scientific research , educational , and cultural and public health departments and all government organizations should use electronic and information technologies and communications networks to set up and improve high-efficiency , reliable , applicable management and social service information systems .  
The numerous opinions put forward in June 1999 , when the NPC Standing Committee deliberated over the final central financial account and the central financial audit report for 1998 , were the reasons why the reform was started officially .  However , according to people who have inside information , the MOF already planned on reforming the budgetary system early on , but did not get down to it .  
In reality , the increase of deficit this year is not the result of implementing a proactive financial policy , but is due to the change in the compilation of budget .  In the past , interests for national debts were not listed in the current central budget , but are listed in the central budget now and reflected in expenditures for this year .  On the surface , even though it appears to be a sharp increase in the deficit , it does not mean that China 's fiscal deficit is not aggravated .  
It is fair to say that the government 's economic management evolved from the manipulative style of the planned economic era to the guidance style of the reform era , but the its way of managing the economy must still progress to the regulation and control mode of the developed economy .  It should regulate the economy by promulgating economic policies , by means of market regulations , and by utilizing financial levers .  But this is premised first and foremost upon the banks becoming bona fide market barometers .  
We should realize that more than half of China 's 20 [ as published ] or so counties are in financial dire straits and are economically backward .  If the county towns ' economies make some progress , there will be hope for radical improvement in the Chinese economy .  Therefore in the new round of economic development , we should put our energy into developing the county towns .  
As for the " financial or debt " question , it is a concept based on years of the accumulative total and theoretical reckoning .  The debts that can really be directly incorporated into the finance or be shared by the fiscal finance are very limited .  
The theme of the fiscal budget is " scaling new heights , " which is exactly an ardent aspiration shared by some 7 million Hong Kong residents .  After enduring the financial storm over the past two years , quite a few residents have sustained such blows as salary cuts or lay-offs .  However , they have carried forward the spirit of working hard despite hardships and accepted the challenge from a new century marked by knowledge economy .  
Meanwhile , last year the Central Military Commission strictly prohibited the army and armed police forces from engaging in business or running enterprises and the income from their business operations which was used as welfare subsidies was thus cut .  Therefore , it was necessary for central financial authorities to compensate this lost portion of financial resources for them .  
Meanwhile , China has increased its foreign exchange reserves , successfully maintained the value of the Renminbi , and tightened its control over the capital market and the foreign exchange market .  As a result , China has attained desired results in resisting the adverse impacts of the Asian financial turmoil , and also in its bid to join the WTO this year .  
In the developing countries , the rise of commodity prices as a result of the growing financial deficits is mainly attributed to the lack of material reserves .  In the mainland , the commodity prices are falling now , and the situation is different from that in other developing countries , because it has sufficient material reserves , which will not give rise to a new round of inflation .  There is not any sign of a new round of inflation in the mainland at present .  
To eliminate the impact of the financial crisis and to quickly revive the economy , the East Asian countries have adopted some feasible methods , mainly including countermeasures against the crisis , in line with actual national conditions ; implemented expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate consumption ; increased exports to promote economic recovery ; paid attention to resolving the major social contradictions affecting their political situations ; and accelerated economic restructuring and reform .  
All East Asian countries paid attention to drawing lessons from the financial crisis and intensified financial reform .  On the one hand , the financial order was straightened out .  Some ailing banks were forced to close down , merge with others , and accept others ' management , so that the bad credit of banks was resolutely resolved .  
Some people generally maintained that the economic structural problems were deep-rooted reasons causing the Asian financial crisis .  To revive the economy , the East Asia countries should exert efforts to readjust the enterprise systems and the industrial structures , attach importance to long-term goals , focus on enhancing international competitiveness , and enhance their national productivity and technological levels through the restructuring of their industries .  
In the latter half of the nineties , after the new constitution was endorsed in a referendum , Russia set up a presidential system and a republican regime , and Yeltsin was elected president .  However , his ties with the number one political party , Communist Party of the Russian Federation [ CPRF ] , worsened .  Russia 's economic development was hindered and hit by several financial crises .  
There will be great developments in the methods of payment of personal checks and credit cards when the real-name savings system is implemented .  The central bank will greatly reduce the amount of printed money , and all financial organs and businesses will greatly cut the manpower and material resources needed to count and take care of their cash .  Consequently , the costs for monetary circulation will be greatly reduced .  
Tung Chee-hwa said : Although we ran into some difficulties - - particularly the financial storm that swept across Asia - - after our reversion , the HKSAR government has taken resolute , daring , and effective measures in conjunction with the firm and persistent fighting spirit of the masses of residents to enable the HKSAR 's financial market to enjoy steady development and the entire economy to gradually move out of the trough and get back to the broad way of prosperity . 
Since the second half of last year , China has pursued a proactive financial policy , thus enabling the economy to maintain a sustained growth .  The GDP in the first quarter of the year was expected to grow 7 percent or higher and the domestic market situation to take a favorable turn .  
China 's economic strength , particularly the foreign economic balancing ability , has been substantially enhanced in the 20 years of development , so that China is capable of accepting such a challenge as opening its financial sector to the outside world , and is powerful enough to maintain a stable currency value .

Since the second half of last year , China has pursued a proactive financial policy , thus enabling the economy to maintain a sustained growth .  The GDP in the first quarter of the year was expected to grow 7 percent or higher and the domestic market situation to take a favorable turn .  
Over the last 20 years , cross-strait trade volume has grown from less than $ 100 million in 1979 to $ 20.5 billion in 1998 , a 265-fold increase or an annual increase of 36.1 percent on average .  During the period of general economic depression in the West and the successive financial crisis in Southeast Asia and East Asia , Taiwan 's economy maintained a growth rate of around 6 percent .  It benefited mainly from trade with the mainland .  
To cope with the deflationary trend , we should change the previous prudent and conservative attitude toward the monetary policy , positively coordinate it with the financial policy , and follow up the policies closely to form the dual pushing forces for economic growth through the practice of a positive financial policy and moderate monetary policy .  
Personalities in foreign countries universally think that the Chinese policy to refrain from Renminbi 's devaluation in recent years has played a positive role in stabilizing the financial markets in Asia . As the principal decisionmaking department responsible for the exchange rate policies , the SAFE had a very good grasp of the policies , and its role is elevated accordingly .  
The meeting pointed out that in order to ensure the implementation of the policy of purchasing peasants ' surplus grain without restriction , the State Council decided to increase the scale of grain risk funds by 8 billion yuan this year , which is to be shared by the central and local financial authorities according to the current proportion they are responsible for ;  
At present , Taiwan 's military expenses exceed $ 10 billion per year .  As long as the hostilities between the two sides of the strait are terminated , Taiwan will be able to save a huge amount of military expenditure and shift the financial resources to social welfare and other fields which need the resources more urgently .  This will obviously be beneficial to the people of Taiwan .  
China 's banking industry should accelerate its pace of transforming operational mechanisms , bring about banking system upgrading , open up new business spheres , elevate its managerial level in a comprehensive way , open the financial sector wider to the outside world , maintain the state 's financial security , and facilitate the strategic adjustment of the national economic structure and the change of economic growth pattern .  
In addition , the amounts of these social security funds should be higher than the previous year .  Except for paying expenditures as required by law , the financial surplus should be mainly used for increasing social security funds .  All localities should carry out a comprehensive and careful examination of this year 's collection of various social security funds as well as social security funds for expenditures in local budgets at all levels .  
The May financial data report issued on 12 June by the People 's Bank of China [ PBOC ] shows that for the first five months of 2000 , China 's financial operations have been stable , with bank loans increasing faster , the investment orientation being rational , the renminbi [ RMB ] exchange rate in a sustained appreciation trend , and enterprise deposits up markedly , showing that enterprise economic efficiency is growing steadily better , and economic prospects are continuing to rebound .  
Since the financial crisis in Asia , China 's economy has experienced severe and complicated tests , but it has still maintained a relatively rapid growth .  In particular , since the beginning of this year , an important turning point has emerged : Economic growth has accelerated , economic results have been considerably improved , the growth in foreign trade has been vigorous , urban and rural consumption has been stable and tended to increase , financial revenue has increased by a big margin , and foreign exchange reserve has continued to increase .  
However , the industrial and commercial circle of Taiwan could not therefore set their minds at rest .  In their thinking , it is absolutely not a simple thing that Ch'en Shih-meng , an official for the " quasi-cabinet " and a long-term advisor to Chen Shui-bian [ Chen Shuibian ] in financial and economic issues , posed the idea of collecting " national security tax " twice in one month , the period from May to early June . The hidden motive and the attempt to sound out the response can not be ignored .  
Now , under the financial support of the central government , the Tibet autonomous region has experienced economic development unimaginable previously and the living standard of the people has been greatly raised .  
However , financial globalization will also separate the flow of international capital more and more from the operation of physical economy , lead to disorderly large-scale capital flow , hold the risks of financial crisis , and make some economic entities partially lose their independent economic policymaking power and their ability to the macro economy .  
In international competition , he stated , the developing nations are subject to restrictions in their domestic systems , policies , and knowledge .  As a result , they are in an unequal status in the course of international competition and are usually fragile in the face of international financial market risks .  
Observers have noted that the eight fields he mentioned would be open to the outside world step by step .  One of the fields included financial services , a field that was strictly restricted to foreign investors in the past .  This indicated the firm stand of the Chinese Government in abiding by relevant international rules and in implementing its commitments .  
The government 's investment in the development of science and technology is limited by its financial resources , and it can not attend to each and every aspect of the development of science and technology but should be responsible mainly for organizing , administering , and funding basic research and make necessary coordination and providing necessary funds for projects to tackle key difficult problems in advanced technology ; as for the general development and application of science and technology , they should be left to enterprises .  
In Chapter 2 of its " Prospects for the 2000 Global Economy , " the World Bank included the following passage : " We believed before that globalization would be conducive to economic growth in developing countries , but financial crises show that globalization has exposed the increasing instability of developing countries as they are integrated with the international financial and commodity markets and that it is more so in developing countries with a relatively big degree of being open to the movement of foreign capital .  
Viewing from international experiences and lessons , there should be at least two prerequisites for opening the financial industry of a country : First , the external environment is stable and safe , and the financial industry will not be subject to frequent and tremendous impacts after it is opened to the outside world ;  
Zhu Rongji summed up the state of the Chinese economy as follows : Since the Asian financial crisis , while the Chinese economy has sustained a severe and complex test , it has still kept quite a fast growth momentum , particularly in 2000 , when it has made a crucial turnaround .  Our economy is growing fast , with its efficiency markedly improved , foreign trade growth being strong , consumption tending to be brisk in the midst of stability , revenue up sharply , and foreign exchange reserves continuing to increase .  
Last year , international investors were not enthusiastic in making investments in Asia because of the influence of the Asian financial crisis .  Total amount of foreign capital imported by China also dropped .  However , the EU 's actual investment in China still reached $ 4.47 billion , an increase of 4 percent over 1998 .  
Since early this year , in view of insufficient demand for essential goods , lagging in structural adjustment , and other deep-rooted problems , China has continued to embraced a positive financial policy ; at the same time , it has implemented a comprehensive western region development strategy and quickened the pace of entering the WTO , bringing about crucial favorable turns in the investment , export , consumption , and other fields .  
Therefore , for a period ahead , China , while continuing to implement a positive financial policy , will step up structural adjustment and efforts to rejuvenate the country by promoting science and education , and broaden the scope of opening up to the outside world , in order to fit itself into the world 's new situation of scientific and technological progress and economic globalization .  
Due to the facts that the trend of an economic globalization has come with a swift and violent momentum and that many things still remain undone which should have been accomplished under the rule of the British Hong Kong authorities , and with the addition that the Asian financial turmoil has exploded the economic bubbles that were formed during the rule of the British Hong Kong authorities and has also exposed the problems and long-standing defects in many fields , the reform tasks facing the SAR government have proved extremely difficult and arduous .  
As an international financial , trade , and commercial center , the Hong Kong SAR has also covered a rough and rugged path in its economic development .  
All levels of finance departments ' funds and expenditure for supporting teenage students ' extracurricular activities and maintaining such venues can be arranged through that extra 1 percent local financial appropriation for educational funds .  
The two sides will , in accordance with the laws of respective countries and bilateral agreements , encourage and protect mutual investment , strengthen the exchanges and cooperation between relevant departments of the two countries , create favorable economic , financial and legal conditions , as well as other conditions , for cooperation between major trade and economic bodies of the two countries , and provide them with necessary support .  
Our total central financial expenditure reached 0.823894 trillion yuan , namely , 107.2 percent of the revised budgetary figure , outstripping the revised budgetary figure by 54.995 billion yuan , or up by 27.8 percent compared with the previous year .  
Speaking of the central financial expenditure in 1999 in terms of both allocation and use , Xiang stated : Our central financial expenditure has conscientiously implemented and carried out both the strategic arrangements laid down by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council and the decision made by the Second Session of the Ninth NPC and has played a positive role in promoting sustained , rapid , or healthy national economic development ; in pressing ahead with a deep-going reform in the state-owned enterprises ; in attaining the goal of shaking off poverty ;  
have intensified our financial support for social security system building ; have continually increased our input in agricultural , forestry , water conservancy , as well as ecological or environmental protection projects ; have comprehensively implemented the CPC Central Committee 's decision on banning the army , the armed police , or the political and legal affairs organs from engaging in commercial activities ;  
Xiang Huaicheng said : China made major achievements in various national economic and social undertakings in 1999 .  The final accounts of central and local governments were rather good , with central financial revenue continuing to maintain a fine growth momentum .  
Guo Zhenqian said : The Auditing Administration conducted the audit and did a tremendous amount work on the execution of the 1999 central budget and other fiscal income and expenditure as well as the management and utilization of the 1998 state bonds special funds , thereby playing an active supervisory role in safeguarding the state financial and economic order .  
The results of the auditing show that in general the tasks in executing the 1999 central budget and managing and utilizing the state bonds special funds have been carried out well .  However , malpractices and unlawful and criminal activities are grave in the current financial and economic sphere , and some existing problems in the central budget management should not be ignored .  
On its part , by the year 2010 , Shanghai will basically have become a modern international metropolitan in terms of its economic strength , municipal layout , market structure , social development , and the degree of civilization as a big city ; and will have become an international economic , financial , and trade center .  
After joining the WTO and gradually opening up its domestic financial markets , what China will be faced with will be a direct confrontation between the strength of the international and domestic markets , and the primary responsibility of the State Administration of Exchange Control will be to read market signals and rely on modern financial programs and methods to dispel and crack down on various speculative activities promptly , upholding orderly and legitimate market competition and safeguarding the economic and financial security of the state .  
With regard to building a rapid reaction mechanism for the market , we should make efforts to counter speculation in the foreign exchange realm our starting point , because once we join the WTO , the foreign currency management departments will of course have to employ after-the-fact inspections to uncover illegal activity in the foreign exchange realm and crack down on it sharply , but the more important thing will be the direct and preemptive disruption of speculative offensive behavior targeting China 's financial markets .  
In the first half of this year , China 's GDP grew at the rate of 8.2 percent , the financial sector operated steadily , and enterprises continued to increase their economic results , which have created favorable conditions for achieving the targets of the entire year 's national economic and foreign trade development .  
Governor of People 's Bank of China [ PBOC ] Dan Xianglong today [ 19 July ] said at a press conference sponsored by the Information Office of the State Council for Chinese and foreign reporters that , during the first half of this year , the PBOC further developed the role of monetary policy , strengthened financial support to economic growth , unveiled a number of management methods and policies , maintained a steady increase of money supply , and significantly promoted a recovery of the national economic growth .  
Following the international custom , the PBOC branches organized more than 50,000 man-trips to inspect the quality of assets and genuine profit and loss of more than 38,000 financial institutions ( including branch offices ) in order to promote the improvement of internal management of commercial banks .  
Seen from the experiences of other countries in the world , to liberalize capital account management , it is generally necessary to have a stable macroeconomic environment , a sound financial system , effective supervisory capability , and immense , comprehensive national strength .  Presently China does not have all such conditions , and therefore it is still necessary to maintain capital account management .  
In view of this situation , the central authorities resolutely worked out major policy decisions to strengthen and improve macroeconomic regulation and control , and started with consolidating the financial and economic order .  To meet the demand of the new situation of building a socialist market economy system and of reform and opening up , they mainly adopted economic and legal means supplemented by essential administrative measures and adopted the " soft landing " method to deal with the overheated economy and inflation .  
To deal with the buffet brought by Asian financial crisis , China has shifted its attention from macroeconomic regulation and control to expansion of domestic demands since 1998 , implemented the proactive financial policy , striven to give play to the role of monetary policy , and comprehensively applied such economic levers as finance , banking , taxation , price , and income distribution to promote investment , consumption and export demands and bring along economic growth .  
Currently , we must seize the development opportunity , make the best of the situation to advance , uphold the principle of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement the proactive financial policy , correctly handle the relations of reform , development , and stability , guarantee a sustained , rapid and sound economic development , and greet the new century with outstanding achievements .  
Apart from that , there was a marked increase in loans for projects in the increased loans of financial institutions in the first half of the year , and these loans supported key state infrastructure construction and the technical revamping of key sectors , and promoted economic restructuring .  
As far as the work of financial departments is concerned , this means the necessity of developing good vocational ethics , establishing the spirit of loving one 's work and the spirit of selfless dedication , establishing the spirit of scrupulously abiding by one 's duty and daring to undertake responsibility , establishing the spirit of doing arduous work , being honest , and exercising self-discipline , and establishing the spirit of handling affairs according to rules and regulations and observing laws and discipline .  
We have further standardized the operational behaviors of the financial companies and have enhanced supervision or management of the financial companies to ensure their healthy development .  Apart from laying down explicit regulations for supporting their healthy development , the newly promulgated " Management Measures " has also introduced some new regulations aimed at enhancing supervision or management or at guarding against risks in light of our experiences or lessons in supervision and management over the past few years .  
Moreover , we have also standardized or systematized the measures adopted by the supervision and management organs in the past in managing the financial companies and have laid down requirements for supervising or managing the financial companies in a unified way in their business relating to both domestic and foreign capital , both domestic and foreign currencies , as well as their business stated on or not on tables .  
Additionally , the new " procedures " have standardized and systemized the measures the supervisory and management organs adopted to manage financial companies and have realized the unified supervision and management of the domestic and foreign capital , the domestic and foreign currencies , and the scheduled and unscheduled operations of financial companies .  
Shortly after Hong Kong completed the historic turn of being recovered by the motherland , it encountered the fierce impact of the Asian financial storm .  At the critical moment , when Hong Kong was being attacked from all sides by international speculators , the central government resolutely indicated that it would support , at all costs , keeping the Hong Kong currency 's exchange rate linked to the US dollar .  This greatly bolstered the SAR Government 's determination to safeguard the Hong Kong people 's wealth .  
To deal with such conspicuous problems as insufficient domestic demand , intensified export competition , greater unemployment pressure , irrational economic structure , and slow increase in peasants ' income , as well as the challenge of the Southeast Asian financial crisis , the Chinese government has adopted a correct policy of increasing government investment to boost domestic demand and promote economic growth .  
Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng recently spoke at a national meeting on financial work held in Beijing . He said : China will make active efforts to properly carry out tax reform in various aspects in accordance with the principle of reducing burdens , improving the taxation system , and standardizing distribution .  He said : China will establish a set of system concerning public financial revenue as well as tax collection and management .  This system will be sound in organization , standardized in distribution , scientific in collection and management , and stable in development .  
He expressed his satisfaction over the concrete cooperation among East Asian countries in the financial field .  He suggested that the emphasis of the cooperation among the 10 ASEAN countries and China , Japan and the ROK should be put on the financial , economic , and scientific and technological fields , and that an expert group for scientific and technological cooperation be set up within the 10-plus-three framework to explore the specific areas and modes of cooperation .  
Those who apply for judicial aid because they face financial harships or those who seek funds for basic living expenses should provide proof that the economic conditions of their own and their families are in conformity with the local government relevant departments ' stipulated standards for citizens ' economic difficulties .  
Since the Asian financial crisis broke out in 1997 , in light of changes in the macroeconomic situation , by judging the hour and sizing up the situation , the CPC Central Committee and the State Council firmly came up with such a major policy decision as expanding the domestic demand and implementing a positive financial policy .  Expanding the domestic demand and implementing a positive financial policy have since played a crucial and key role in sustaining stable economic growth ;  
pushing forward economic structural readjustment ; improving people 's forecast ; and slowing down a deflationary tendency with the result that we have withstood the repercussions of the Asian financial crisis and maintained steady economic and social development , and for which , we have been highly appraised by the world opinion at large .  
This year , our country 's economic operation has picked up with a strong momentum , for our major economic indices , such as investment , export , and so on , have risen quickly ; our consumption temperature has gone up ; and our macroeconomic situation has witnessed a continued turn for the better , which has further attested to the results of expanding the domestic demand and implementing a positive financial policy . 
Li Lanqing finally stressed : We should continue to work hard and ensure that all this year 's budgetary tasks will be fulfilled .  In the first half of this year , our country 's macroeconomic situation witnessed a significant turn for the better and our financial revenue tended to rise rapidly , and this has laid a sound basis for us to fulfill this year 's tasks .  
In past years , the party central leadership and the State Council adopted a series of policies and measures for promoting economic growth .  In particularly , a positive financial policy was pursued for three consecutive years , and it played an extremely important role in pulling up the domestic demand , and thus creating a favorable market condition for freeing state-owned enterprises from difficulties .  
In keeping with the operational state of the national economy , China 's financial expenditures and outlays maintained fairly rapid growth during the first half of the year , with fiscal revenues coming to 624 billion yuan , an increase of 94.6 billion yuan ( or 17.9% ) over the same period last year , while nationwide fiscal outlays came to 583.8 billion yuan , an increase of 119.0 billion yuan ( or 25.6% ) over the same period the previous year . 
The central financial authorities will also select some government bond key projects in the near future to implement a pilot project in centralized treasury disbursements , no longer disbursing funds by going through the departments in charge at every level , thus reducing the disbursement links , reducing the transit time of the funds , keeping funds from lying idle , and preventing the misappropriation or diversion of funds .  
contribute to help maintaining world peace and promoting common development ; and while stressing political dialogue , enhance bilateral exchanges and cooperation in economic , trade , financial , scientific , technological , cultural , and educational areas , so that the dialogue mechanism becomes a major channel in pushing forward mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Latin America .  
Soon afterwards , Luo Gan went to the BMPSB 's police affairs center to watch the development of the Beijing municipal integrated public security information network and non-native population information system as well as a demonstration of the satellite positioning system for financial institution alarms and to hear reports on the state of the BMPSB 's science and technological planning for the 10th Five-Year Plan period and planning for the " Golden Shield Project . "  
While financial policies have more direct effects than monetary policies , the central treasury 's revenues in 1998 accounted only 6.1 percent of the GDP . The percentage increased a little in 1999 , but it was still a low 7.8 percent .  Financial policies can not possibly encourage internal demand unless these policies are applied in vital areas where they can really encourage consumption and nongovernmental investments .  
Meanwhile , several large-scale enterprises in Taiwan are facing a financial crisis , natural disasters have occurred repeatedly in agricultural production , and farmers have difficulties in selling their products despite falling prices .  People have lost their interest in Taiwan 's stocks .  How can the stock market be saved by a " cardiac stimulant ? "  
According to public opinion in Taiwan , Taiwan 's financial and economic policy has been swinging from side to side and various problems have arisen in its economy after the new authorities assumed power .  The unclear future of cross-strait relations , in particular , has been the fundamental cause of the stock market 's continuous fall .  
Also , according to public opinion , some people from the authorities should not indulge in " performances " and instead should put the Taiwan people 's well-being above everything else and publish feasible financial and economic policies and take measures to prevent the spread of disorderliness and outbreak of crises as soon as possible so as to create an internal and external environment favorable to the stock market 's recovery .  
Finance is the " heart " of modern economy and undermining the country 's financial order is comparable to stabbing the " heart " with a dagger .  If the wound is minor , the bank alone will suffer some financial loss ; and if the wound is deep , the case can trigger an economic crisis and the people will suffer .  
The Taiwan public believes that " diplomatic relations " established on " money " are like " fair weather friends , " and will not last long .  Moreover , the " financial aid " countries are all weak and backward countries , and are of absolutely no use .  
Zeng Peiyan indicated that in the future , economic work must uphold the guiding policy of expanding domestic demand ; grasp opportunities for development ; continue to implement a proactive financial policy ; accelerate the pace of reforms in the economic system and adjustments in economic structure ; exert effort on resolving significant contradictions in economic life ; and promote a sound cycle of development in the national economy .  
The opposition parties have been continuously bombarding the National Reunification Council , and the outlook for the " Chen-Lien Meeting " has changed .  Subsequently the roundtable of political parties may be in the dilemma of breaking up .  Moreover , discontent within the DPP as the minority ruling party is continuing to brew , with the grudge directed at the financial and economic cabinet members .  
In addition to striving to stabilize the political situation , plan economic reform , pacify Chechnya , reorganize the armed forces , and declare war on the increasingly influential financial oligarchs and local warlords , he has also been actively and steadily readjusting Russia 's foreign policy and intensely pursuing a pragmatic diplomacy .  
The CMC stressed the need to finish all the tasks of reducing the size of the armed forces by half a million in the last year of the three-year deadline .  Moreover , the armed forces should concentrate their limited financial resources on striving to effect , in the shortest possible time , a complete change from a manpower-intensive and numerically large type to a technology-intensive and quality-based efficient one to ensure that they can cope with a hi-tech local war that may break out at any time .  
The Supreme People 's Court has adjusted adjudication work arrangements .  It has established and improved its systems of criminal adjudication , civil adjudication , and administrative adjudication with Chinese characteristics , abolished its technical , financial , and headquarters affairs bureaus , established a bureau of administration and equipment for judicial operations to be in charge of the work of administrative management of judicial operations , and extensively downsized administrative departments while strengthening adjudication bodies .  
Since they assumed power , the new Taiwan authorities have not acted rationally and frequently implemented financial and economic policies which were contradictory to one another .  As Taiwan authorities are pursuing delaying tactics while waiting for changes , it is unlikely that the " three links " will be implemented within the foreseeable future .  
Over the past year , through reforming the government 's approval and auditing system , the province adopted the economic responsibility auditing system , improved the system for democratically recommending cadres , more strictly implemented the regulations for the work of party committees , and established the system for relevant leaders to submit their regular personal financial reports to show they are clean and uncorrupt All this comprehensively strengthened supervision over principal leaders .  
First of all , we should do a good job in scientific planning , accurately select the priority tasks , concentrate our financial and material resources on solving major problems that concern the overall development of the western region , and promote a comprehensive economic and social development .  
In the five years that will soon be over , China successfully has withstood the assaults of the financial crisis sweeping Asia .  Its national economy has maintained sustained , rapid , and healthy development ; its overall national strength has risen markedly ;  
If war breaks out , the blows dealt to Taiwan 's economy can not be compared to a minor power cut or a major earthquake ; the financial securities market will fall into serious chaos , the stock market will dive , there will be massive exchange rate turbulence , foreign investment will be withdrawn , and the entire Taiwan economy may be paralyzed , so Taiwan will find it very difficult to fight a protracted war with the mainland .  
While many national economic organizations , major businesses in the industrial , commercial , financial and other sectors and far-sighted personages in various walks of life in the United States actively urged Congress to pass the bill , more and more Congressmen also gave clear-cut support to permanent normal trade relations with China . Solving permanent normal trade relations with China has become the mainstream aspiration in the United States .  
Hit by the double whammy of the impact of the Asian financial crisis externally and its serious impact on exports , and the structural surpluses and anemic domestic demand internally , the Party Central Committee readjusted its macro-regulatory policy priorities in a timely manner , implementing aggressive fiscal policies and using various economic levers in an integrated fashion to expand domestic demand and curb the deflationary trend and promote the various reforms in a stable manner , which played a decisive role in overcoming the difficulties occasioned by the financial crisis and stimulating the economic recovery .  
Those attending the meetings included responsible officials in charge of combating corruption at its source in various provincial , autonomous regional , and municipal discipline inspection commissions , supervision departments , and financial departments ( or bureaus ) , as well as responsible officials of relevant departments under the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and the Ministry of Supervision .  
The main points of the reform are : With regard to the basic organizational form of budget , they exercised departmental budget control by putting funds of different characters having financial purposes in a unified budget so that the funds would go to the departments using them , changing the traditional practice of centralized management of funds by specialized departments .  
In January 1999 , a budget making and examination service center , under the provincial financial department , was set up , responsible for checking on individual and public expenses of various departments and on the special funds for enterprise development items .  
all expenses in a year are crystal clear ; and all internal financial departments do not need to : make a budget , apply for additional appropriations , care about their financial accounts , and set aside funds to meet unexpected needs .  Therefore , the budget is scientific and transparent , and the fund distribution is fair and just .  
Dai Xianglong said : China has extricated itself from the impact of the Asian financial crisis .  However , in face of the challenges of the financial globalization , the PBOC will continue to practice a moderate monetary policy , further the reform of interest rate marketization , institute a modern commercial banking system , further improve and perfect a unitary and well-managed floating exchange rate system taking the market supply and demand as its foundation , and open the financial sector wider to the world .  
The central bank should correctly handle the relations between preventing financial risks and supporting economic growth , work hard to enhance the level of manipulating monetary policy , regulate money supply in good time , provide positive guidance to credit orientation , give vigorous support to economic structural adjustment , guard against and defuse financial risks , and facilitate the steady rebound of the national economy .  
The " US National Interests Committee " which is composed of some strategic analysts also regards preventing those major global systems , including trade , financial markets , energy , and environmental realms , from disastrous collapse as a matter affecting the vital interests of the United States ( from the above-mentioned book about the US National Interests Committee , page 4 ) They believe that to ensure this kind of global interests , " the US resources are limited . "  
As a matter of fact , we did not make any substantive adjustment to the tax preferential policies toward foreign investors .  In 1997 , we intended to adjust the tax referential policy in terms of import equipment , but owing to the changes in macroeconomic situation such as the Asian financial crisis , we suspended the policy adjustment .  
and the East Asian countries have practiced a series of more favorable and open policies to attract foreign capital in an attempt to accelerate economic recovery in the wake of the Asian financial crisis .  In 1999 , the direct foreign investment in the Republic of Korea grew by 75.6 percent over the previous year , which is also an important factor leading to the decline of foreign capital flowing into China .  
The special administrative regional government , headed by Mr . Tung Chee-hwa , has been governing the region in accordance with the Basic Law and has gradually overcome the difficulties brought about by the Asian financial crisis , in addition to promoting an all-round economic recovery and consolidating Hong Kong 's status of being the international financial , trade , and shipping center .  
Today , when being interviewed by Xinhua , Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng said that in the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , China positively and actively applied the financial policies to conduct macroeconomic readjustment and control , and this played a major role in maintaining the sustained , high-speed , and healthy development of the national economy , promoting reforms in all fields , and safeguarding social stability .  
He pointed out : The positive financial policy being put into practice since 1998 has effectively driven economic growth , promoted the increase in financial revenues , successfully brought about a major turning point in the national economy in the first months of this year , created a favorable environment for reform and development , and also enriched our experience in macroeconomic management .  
set aside enough funds for their scientific research , development of new products , and depreciation ; take earnest steps to increase financial input in technological innovation and technical transformation ; and do more solid work in order to enhance their staying power for a future development .  
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , in terms of the fundamental implementation of goals for the reform and development of the banking industry , it is estimated that during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , combined domestic and foreign financial loans increased by a total of 5.8 trillion yuan , for an average annual increase of 13.9 percent ;  
A financial management company was established to purchase bad commercial bank loans which were nationally funded , the central bank 's capital filled out , branch structure reduced and consolidated , internal management strengthened , and the international assessment standard raised .  
At the beginning of the Ninth Five-Year Plan , continued management was given to the serious inflation problem , and an economic soft landing was achieved .  In the middle of the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , given the trend toward deflation , a policy of monetary stabilization was implemented , moving from the use of primarily direct control toward using methods of indirect financial control ;  
Second , in light of changes in the situation after China 's entry into the World Trade Organization , it will continue to deepen the reform of the fiscal revenue system , further improve the revenue-sharing system between the central and local governments , positively promote the reform of the fiscal budget system , improve the system of the transfer of payments by the Treasury , actively and steadily promote the transformation of administrative fees into taxes , and gradually establish a public financial framework that meets the needs of the socialist market economy .  
According to Wang Jun , the Ministry of Finance has adjusted its internal mechanism and functions to meet the requirements of the establishment of the new fiscal expenditure management system this year after fully taking into consideration the needs of major financial reforms such as the unified control of budgetary and extra-budgetary funds and the establishment of a centralized system of receipt and payment by the Treasury .  
The economy has maintained steady growth momentum in the first three quarters , and besides the impact of global economic recovery and the brisk international markets , the good situation is due largely to the state 's implementation of a positive financial policy , a sound monetary policy , and the policy to readjust the industrial structure .  
The committee members say that in order to improve the use-efficiency of funds raised through national debt issuance , the relevant parties must assume full responsibility and put a firm grip on the construction and management of the national debt-funded projects .  In particular , the many responsibility systems must be strengthened ; project construction and financial management must be properly supervised and checked , and violations of law and order must be investigated and stopped .  
To further give play to the advantages and potential of cooperation between Asia and Europe in the economic and trade , financial , scientific and technological aspects , Premier Zhu set forth five important proposals : First , expanding trade , investment , and financial cooperation between Asia and Europe to meet the needs in the optimization of the industrial structure .  
The statement calls on various countries to painstakingly contribute to maintaining the situation of world and regional security , establish a new international political and economic order , quicken the tempo of multilateral international trade and the opening up of regional organizations , intensify the economic and financial cooperation and scientific and technological exchanges between the two continents in the era of information , and so on .  
During his brief stay in the United States , Xiang Huaicheng also held talks with Summers and US National Economic Adviser Sperling [ si po lin ] .  The two sides exchanged views on international and domestic issues of common concern .  On 27 October , representatives of the Chinese Finance Ministry and the US Treasury Department will also hold a Sino-US financial dialogue and the first vice-ministerial-level session of the Sino-US Joint Economic Committee here to exchange views on such issues as capital markets , financial monitoring , corporate reorganization , and disclosure of accounting information .  
Both sides looked forward to the strengthening of cooperation in this regard .  They also noted that the APEC recently agreed to set up a working group that would conduct a survey of the domestic legal and regulatory frameworks for fighting financial crime in various economies .  
He expressed his concern for the sustainability of China 's medium-term fiscal policies , considering in particular the contingent liability of the financial sector as well as possible expenditures for the social security net , pension funds , infrastructure construction and environmental protection in future .  
Social security outlays as a percentage of total financial outlays will be further increased , and such methods as imposing a social security tax , reducing state owned shares , and expanding the issue of lotteries will be studied in the interest of establishing a pluralistic capital source , standardizing the social security system , and managing service socialization of the social security setup .  
The local people 's governments at all levels should adopt preferential policies for , offer financial support to , and step up supervision and management of the work of vocational education and training for demobilized servicemen and may also accept and settle in a planned way and in light of the needs of developing the western regions on a large scale some outstanding professional personnel among demobilized servicemen in the western regions . 
According to a financial official , the total quantity control of the no haste , be patient policy absolutely will have no precise restriction on figures , but will take foreign investment demand , the amount of domestic funds , and the rate of economic growth as indexes .  
The leaders instructed their ministers to formulate more effective strategies for economic restructuring , further improving the social security systems , optimizing governmental management , and creating a benign environment for financial institutions and industrial and commercial enterprises .  
China began to adopt the export rebate policy in 1985 .  Since 1998 , the state has increased the rates for export rebates three times in an effort to address the negative effects caused by the Asian financial crisis , as well as to stop the deflationary trend .  The moves have powerfully promoted export and contributed significantly to the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
In recent years , the United States has become more and more aware of the challenge brought by the sudden rise of China and regarded this as " one of the greatest challenges in making foreign policies for the 21st century . "  Any view that ignores or neglects China 's role is shortsighted and harmful .  In particular , after the Asian financial crisis , the United States has noted that China 's big power image is moving in a " positive direction , " and that China is a responsible power that can be cooperated with .  
Jeffrey Koo said : Advanced countries do not have many restrictions regarding sending back the investment made by transnational companies .  A long time ago when Taiwan did not have an ample foreign exchange reserve , it set a requirement , setting a yearly limit for Taiwan businessmen to remit money to foreign countries .  According to China 's current financial system , it is difficult for Taiwan businessmen to remit their profits back to Taiwan .  
In the process of investigation , the provincial committee for discipline , aside from confirming the facts about the huge bribes taken by Lin , has discovered that the Land Bureau and the Development Center both had adopted some serious illegal financial and economic regulations .  The establishment of a private treasury inside these institutions is very serious .  The amount in the treasury reaches several hundred million yuan in renminbi ;  
The FAMC should engage a certified public accountant acknowledged by the MOF to conduct annual audit of its financial position and submit audit reports to all relevant supervisory and administrative departments in a timely manner .  
At present , we should conscientiously study the knowledge relating to the socialist market economy , transform our concepts on financial and economic work , quicken the pace of building the public finance suited to China 's national conditions , further adjust and optimize the financial revenue-expenditure structure , incrementally reduce investment in the profit-making and operational spheres , vigorously cut down the administrative and institutional spending , push the operational institutions into the market , and concentrate the use of financial resources mainly on the areas of social and public necessities and social security .  
Li Lanqing stressed that to set up a framework of public finance , it is imperative to foster a new concept on financial management , and its basic ideas can be summarized in the following words : " Appropriate proportion , suitable centralization and decentralization , reasonable income and expenditure , and proper use of funds . "  
We should practice the international prevailing system of concentrated receipt and payment by the national treasury and intensify the unified control and management of government financial funds , so as to change once and for all the chaotic situation in the past characterized by the decentralized management of financial funds and multiple accounts opened by various departments and units .  
Liu Jiang emphasized that developed countries must take practical actions to perform their commitments according to the convention in technology transfer and financial support and in satisfying specific needs of developing countries so as to narrow the widening South-North wealth gap and science and technology gap and realistically solve the climate change problem .  
In addition , we must strengthen the development of the contingent of cadres and try hard to build a contingent of fiscal and financial cadres who are smart and capable , highly efficient , honest , and pragmatic .  
Furthermore , they should closely serve the objectives and tasks of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " ; make relevant predictions and formulate countermeasures to deal with problems that might appear in the course of development ; strictly prevent and crack down on serious economic criminal activities including smuggling , fraudulence in foreign exchange transactions , obstruction of the order of financial management , financial fraudulence , and manufacturing and sales of fake and substandard commodities ;  
Foci of the crackdowns against various economic crimes include : the smuggling and sale of smuggled goods , tax cheating , threatening of tax collectors , undermining of financial management order , fraud , production and sale of counterfeit and inferior quality products , and violation of intellectual property rights .  
It is necessary to intensify the support of the financial industry for economic growth and encourage all circles of society to increase their investment .  The pace of the preliminary work for major projects , such as the northward transfer of southern water and Qinghai-Tibet railway , should be quickened , with project quality management and financial management improved .  
Following Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's strategic thinking characterized by its broad and long-term view , the Party Central Committee , with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , established Shanghai 's strategic position and asked the municipality to be turned into an international economic , financial , and trade center as soon as possible .  
In addition , a report published by a foreign firm Solomen Meibang [ name as transliterated ] , Taiwan 's banks currently have potential bad debts totaling NT $ 1.7 trillion to NT $ 2 trillion .  More enterprises are expected to default on their loans in the next six months , which would lead to bankruptcy of some peripheral financial institutions .  
In the near term , the continuous practice of the proactive financial policies and moderate monetary policies is the concrete measure for carrying out the policy of expanding domestic demand , which is needed to ensure the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
By going through comprehensive development , enlarging investment in fundamental facilities , implementing financial transfers and payments , and other measures , Guangdong has increased support for 16 impoverished counties , causing the entire province 's national economy [ as received ] to maintain rapid growth .  
Only as a result of extricating large - and medium-sized state-owned enterprises carrying excessive debt and bogged down in difficulties from these difficulties , integrating reforms for state-owned commercial banks that concentrate on disposal of bad assets , and the State adopting resolute measures for transforming the banks ' partial creditor 's rights in these enterprises into the shareholder 's rights of financial asset management companies will some products be enabled to have a market , prospect for development , advanced technology , a good operational foundation , and a strong leadership team .  
If the fund is used in advance , the authorities will have no money to use once an incident occurs.Last year , the old authorities agreed to release a special fund in NT $ 14.3 billion before the new fiscal year began to help resolve financial problems faced by counties and cities .  
Li Lanqing said in his letter that under the leadership of the party 's central committee and the State Council , significant headway has been made in financial reforms and tremendous achievements have been scored in the financial work over the past few years , as a result of practicing the proactive financial policies and intensifying and improving the macroeconomic regulation and control in finance , which have promoted the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Measures should be taken to ensure that the salaries of staff and workers in the administrative units and public institutions are paid in full and on time , resolve the problem of salaries in arrears that exists in the units at county and township levels in real earnest , and further do a good job of the unified payment of salaries and financial expenses in the party and government organs and educational departments .  
Third , great efforts should be made to carry out the reform of financial expense management structure and perfect the reform of taxation system , positively practice the centralized treasury receipt and payment system , tighten the unified transfer and management of the government 's financial funds , and radically change the previous chaotic situation of decentralized management of financial funds and multiple accounts opened by departments and units . 
At present , financial departments at all levels should foster the idea of managing the public finance in a conscientious way and change their financial management model from the old tradition of laying more weight on distribution than on management , more weight on examination and approval than on supervision , and more weight on microeconomy than on macroeconomy to the practice of intensifying macroeconomic regulation and control , macroscopic management , and financial supervision .  
Economically , stock prices have fallen sharply , the real estate market is sluggish , many traditional industries have totally moved out of the island , and a financial storm is looming ahead .  The economy has continued to decline , and with the end of the year drawing near , enterprises are meeting with difficulties in settling their debts , while there is a sharp rise in the number of jobless people .  Because of this , the local people have no confidence in Taiwan 's future .  
If economic growth slows down or if recession emerges in following years , original estimated revenue will decrease and the Bush administration will be caught in a dilemma in a tax cut .  It will either cause new financial deficits by cutting tax according to the original plan or be dissatisfied by enterprises and the broad masses of voters , especially people of the upper middle class , if he shrinks the size of a tax cut .  
We must adhere to the principle of expanding domestic demand , continue to implement a proactive financial policy and a moderate monetary policy , comprehensively use all means of macroeconomic regulation and control to consolidate and develop the good situation of economic growth and promote the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy and comprehensive social progress , and strive to make a good start in fulfilling the Tenth Five-year Plan .  
As Shanghai is the main pillar of the national strategy to turn it into an international economic , financial , and trading center , our goal is to make every effort to raise Shanghai 's comprehensive competitiveness , so that it will play a more important role in serving the entire nation and in participating in the world economic competition .  
With regard to the rapidly worsening financial situation of Agriculture Council credit departments , Control Yuan Member Kuo Shi-chi pointed out after releasing the survey that the ratio of non-agricultural loans provided by Agriculture Council credit departments has increased in recent years ; the credit departments ' system of credit rating and extending credit is unsound and most credit-receiving customers are of the higher-risk marginal group rejected by big banks .  As a result , the ratio of overdue loans has increased drastically and already reached 16.1 percent in 1999 .  
Wu Yi said , under the " Ninth Five-year Plan , " China successfully overcame a series of foreign economic and trade problems , especially those created by the Asian financial crises ; the many undertakings continued to expand to become an important driving force behind the nation 's economic development , playing an important role in promoting macroeconomic stability and increasing the country 's comprehensive national strength .  
Moreover , we should improve a financial structure for supporting foreign trade and economic cooperation focusing on export credits and export insurance , promote the organic combination of export credit insurance and export financing business , and establish a foreign-related economic and legal system , which is relatively perfect and conforms to WTO rules and China 's national condition ;  
While continuing to investigate and deal with cases such as corruption , bribery , embezzlement of public funds , smuggling and peddling contraband , tax and foreign exchange fraud , and financial swindling , we must pay attention to investigating and handling serious cases of violations of political , organizational , and personnel discipline by leading cadres ; cases of serious dereliction of duty ; cases of leading cadres ' spouses , sons and daughters , and relatives taking advantage of the influence of the leading cadres ' powers and position to pursue illegal profit ;  
The policies and measures involved in the circular included increasing construction fund , giving priority to launching construction projects , stepping up transfer of financial payment , strengthening support for financial loan , implementing a preferential taxation policy , implementing a preferential policy on land and mineral resources , further expanding the area of foreign investment , expanding the channel of foreign capital utilization , and increasing educational investment .  
Zeng Peiyan said : In 1998 , the CPC Central Committee decided to implement a proactive fiscal policy in order to overcome the adverse impact of the Asian financial crisis , expand domestic demand , and maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy national development .  
Tang Jiaxuan pointed out that China will continue to unswervingly pursue a peaceful foreign policy of acting independently and keeping the initiative in its own hands , make efforts to advocate world multipolarization , actively deal with economic globalization , further participate in international economic and trade , financial , and science and technology cooperation and regional cooperation , work to promote the establishment of a fair and rational new international political and economic order , and spur mankind 's just cause of peace and development .  
In short , we should vigorously facilitate the rational circulation and optimum allocation of production elements to ensure that material , financial , and human resources are turned to best account and bring into full play the role of markets and resources at home and abroad in the large-scale western development .  
In 1998 , in order to counter the adverse effects of the Asian financial crisis and continue the national economy 's sustained , rapid , and healthy development , the Party Central Committee decided to implement a policy to expand domestic demand by issuing more treasury bonds to finance long-term construction projects and strengthen infrastructure constructions .  
At the same time , Taiwan 's financial authorities were forced to admit that the rate of Taiwan banks ' overdue loans has already reached 8 percent and more , and bad loans have reached more than $ 1.2 trillion NTD ; whether or not a large-scale or " local style " financial upheaval will explode in Taiwan has become a hot topic in international economic circles .  
To obtain windfall profits , some criminal elements build connections with leading cadres in various ways and corrupt them by bribing them with a large amount of money or through providing them with sexual services .  Over-concentration of power in some cadres , a lack of transparency in the exercise of power as well as a lack of an effective oversight and check system against abuse of powers give rise to corruption like the exchange of power for money .  In addition , because of the state 's limited financial power , public servants ' pay is low .  
The reform of rural credit cooperatives should limit to correcting the direction of persistently serving " three aspects of agriculture " ; and should strive to attain the goal of clearly defining relations between ownership and management , improving and perfecting the structure of management by legal persons , guarding against financial risks , changing the management style , reinforcing internal management , and keeping bad debts and operational losses under strict control .  
However , taking into consideration the negative impact of the expansionary financial policy , there is a need to adjust the focus of the macropolicy in a timely manner and correspondingly weaken the " primary " impetus , to prevent the excessive accumulation of negative effects resulting from the prolonged implementation of the policy on expansionary demand and fully invigorate the vitality of supply and civilian-run enterprises by strengthening the " secondary " impetus , thereby laying a solid foundation for the long-term , sustained stability of the national economy .  
China 's banking , securities , and insurance systems have earnestly implemented the central authorities ' financial policies and measures , pursued prudent monetary policies , effectively supported industrial restructuring , and effectively helped state enterprises in resolving their difficulties and restructuring .  
Wu Bangguo indicated : At present , China has already shaken off the adverse influences of the Asian financial crisis , a smooth progress has been registered in the country 's strategic readjustments to its economic structure , the three-year target for the reform and the difficulty-relief work of state enterprises has been basically fulfilled , and China 's national economic development has taken a major turn for the better and has maintained the momentum of a fairly fast growth .  
Responsible comrades of the organizational , institutional structuring , financial , and pharmaceutical supervision and management departments of the party committees and people 's governments of all provinces , autonomous regions , and municipalities and responsible comrades of the relevant departments of the people 's governments of the cities with independent budgetary status and cities at the deputy provincial level , the Xinjiang Production Corps , and other relevant central and State Council departments attended the meeting .  
Dai Xianglong said : It is necessary to continuously maintain an appropriate growth of money supply .  The planned targets of credit regulation and control for 2001 are as follows : The broad money ( M2 ) is projected to grow by 13 percent to 14 percent , and the narrow money ( M1 ) 15 percent to 16 percent ; net cash injection will be kept within 150 billion yuan , while the aggregate loans by financial institutions are expected to grow by 1.3 trillion yuan .  
The meeting gave a preliminary analysis and forecast for the 2001 financial situation .  It endorsed the PBOC 's anticipated targets of monetary and credit control : M2 is projected to grow by 13 to 14 percent and M1 15 to 16 percent .  Net cash injection will be kept within 150 billion yuan , while the aggregate loans by financial institutions are expected to growth by 1.3 trillion yuan , about the same level as last year .  
The quality and efficiency of economic growth was markedly improved , financial revenue also increased by a big margin , the readjustment of the economic structure was being actively advanced , and reforms in all aspects were being carried forward in depth .  The scope of opening up to the outside world was further expanded .  Comprehensive development was made in the fields of science and technology , education , culture , public health , sports , and all other social undertakings .  
All this will definitely provide various business opportunities for Hong Kong . For example , Hong Kong may raise and provide funds , financial services , and other relevant professional service for the development projects in the western part of China , and may directly launch investment projects there as well .  The local advantages in the interior areas may be used in cooperative production , and the products may be exported and directly shipped to domestic markets in other areas .  
In order to survive and develop in face of the fierce international competition after China 's WTO entry and the gradual financial integration in the world , China 's large enterprises have continuously quickened their pace for restructuring .  They have also gone overseas to list their shares and enhanced their actual strength to meet international challenges .  
Zhu Mingxian said : At the critical period of China 's economic structural adjustment , it is imperative to firmly seize the quality work as the main direction of attack , which is of extremely important significance to expanding domestic demands and practicing the proactive financial policy .  
The appointment of Donald Tsang , who is familiar with government operations , as chief secretary for administration , and the appointment of Antony Leung , who is a member of the Executive Council and a financier , as financial secretary , however , avoided a great change in the positions of senior officials , and showed the possibility of bringing qualified people in the private sector into the civil service system , thus strengthening the government .  The appointments are laudable .  
While acting as the financial secretary , he personally understood the principle of " one country , two systems " was fully put into effect , and thus enhanced his faith in serving the SAR Government and contributing to the implementation of the principle .  On the recommendation of the chief executive , the State Council appointed Donald Tsang as chief secretary for administration to coordinate government operations and lead 180,000 civil servants .  
At this historical juncture , in using its social resources and in its industrial restructuring , Hong Kong must put greater stress on cost-effectiveness and on increasing its value-adding ability .  It is wise to allow an international financier to plan financial and industrial work , because he is in a better position to : understand the needs of various industries , create new ideas , amass talents , create new industries , and achieve optimum allocation of resources .  Antony Leung will , like his predecessor , handle financial matters with circumspection .  
China must go further to expand domestic demand , promote sustained and stable economic development , and can not depend for a long time on methods of borrowing money from national financial organs .  It must expand the vigor of non-government investment , and make up an investment system and mechanism for the entire society that is driven by finance and investment , and in which non-government investment actively participates .  
The improvement of the state 's macroeconomic environment mainly included the adoption of a proactive financial policy and moderate monetary policy , the expansion of domestic demands , and the promotion of economic growth by means of investment , consumption , and export , which have played an excellent role in improving the external environment for enterprises ' production and operation .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out : Since last year , a number of counties and cities in Anhui Province and other provinces and autonomous regions have carried out the trial reform of taxes and charges in rural areas in accordance with the arrangements made by the party Central Committee and the State Council , and have achieved initial good results .  First , the peasants ' burdens have been reduced by a great extent and the " arbitrary collection of fees , unreasonable penalties and unjustified financial levies " has been effectively curtailed .  
The reform policy is to tackle the current actual situation in rural areas , and is supported by the broad masses of peasants and cadres at the grassroots level .  It is a policy to fundamentally solve the problem of the " arbitrary collection of fees , unreasonable penalties and unjustified financial levies " in rural areas , to reduce the peasants ' burdens , and to protect and whip up the peasants ' enthusiasm for production .  
Responsible persons of various provinces , autonomous regions , municipalities directly under the jurisdiction of the central authorities , and the Xinjiang Production-Construction Corps ; responsible persons of concerned ministries and departments of the party Central Committee , the National People 's Congress and the State Council ; and responsible persons of offices of leading groups of financial and agricultural departments and commissions of various provinces , autonomous regions and municipalities for the reform of taxes and charges in rural areas attended the meeting .  
The direct cause of the inability to reduce farmers ' burden is that township financial budgets have to support too great a population , have to meet goals and upgrade in various activities , and complete " cosmetic projects " which can not be halted despite repeated attempts to do so .  This leaves townships with weak financial budgets and a heavy debt load .  
The economists held that the current financial system in our country can not meet the requirements of getting accession into the World Trade Organization . In particular , the state-owned commercial banks will be facing sterner challenges , and the issue of bad assets will become more serious .  It is necessary to explore an effective and feasible solution .  
Using high technologies , starting from on high to deal with China in the outer space to attract China 's attention , making it concentrate its entire financial , material and human resources , as the former Soviet Union did , on an arms race in the outer space .  Then , cutting the ground from under China 's foot , completely do China in .  Such kind of calculations based on wishful thinking , to be sure , is also very laughable .  
As pointed out by Regina Ip , the Hong Kong Association of Falun Dafa is no ordinary organization .  Besides being heretical and making people obsessed , it is also a tightly built organization with strong mobilization power and financial resources and is targeting itself directly at the central authorities .  Its activities have caused public concern , and it is also necessary for the government to pay attention to their activities .  
Li Lanqing called for the governments at all levels to highly value the literary , artistic , and sports undertaking , regard it as a major component of the building of socialist spiritual civilization , increase the intensity of financial input , and give correct guidance to further advance the literary , artistic , and sports undertaking .  
Wang Zhiqiong cited the 1998 statistics and said : In 1998 , the input made by the Chinese Government in the field of public health amounted to 58.72 billion yuan , but only 9.25 billion yuan was actually used in rural areas , accounting for only 15.9 percent of the total medical expenditure .  As a result of the insufficient financial input in rural public health undertakings , many grass-roots hospitals and clinics remain in very poor conditions .  Buildings are simple and crude ;  
Deputy Zhang Baoyi , mayor of Zhangjiakou City , said : This is an amazing achievement .  These years , the work of aiding the poor to tackle difficult problems has been done as an important task from the central to local levels , and actual results have been achieved from formulating policies to inputting human , financial , and material resources into this work .  
The relevant department disclosed that the Chinese People 's Liberation Army will increase the salaries and benefits of its officers and soldiers ( including the salaries of nonmilitary personnel and the allowances for soldiers ) next month .  The increase rate is about 25 percent over the current salaries .  This expense will be incorporated in the total military spending budget worked out by Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng under the national financial expenditure for this year .  
CPPCC member and Shanghai Fuxing High Tech ( Group ) Inc . CEO Guo Guangchang said that when China joins the WTO , the dynamics of financial opening to foreign counties will increase further , presenting our domestic economic and fiscal reform with new opportunities and challenges .  Opening up a non-government owned and operated bank market and preparing to establish non-government owned and operated banks is essential , and in every aspect of this the prerequisites have already matured .  
He says : Anhui and some other local areas have been quite successful in launching pilot projects of reforming their tax and fee collection systems .  The pilot projects have set the financial obligations for the peasants , the state , and the collectives ; effectively reduced the peasants ' burdens , and stopped the collection of unwarranted levies , fines , and obligations in the rural areas .  
The year 2000 was the third year in which the country implemented an active fiscal policy .  As result of the investment projects , financed with the capital obtained from floating national bonds , the economic growth increased 1.7 percent .  That was another significant contribution the active financial policy made for the national economic growth following the additional economic growths of 1.5 and 2 percent 1998 and 1999 , respectively .  
We are also facing the arduous tasks of reforming the education and scientific research systems , the administrative system , the financial system , the investment system , the taxation system , the foreign trade system , the social security system , the income distribution system , the medical and public health system , and especially the leadership system , the economic system , and the management systems in all aspects .  In some fields , reforms have just be started .  
The ' outline ' points out that in order to establish and perfect financial organization systems , market systems , oversight systems , and regulation and control systems , there must be comprehensive reform of the commercial banks wholly owned by the state .  Qualified commercial banks that are wholly owned by the state can be reorganized into share-holding commercial banks in which the state controls the shares .  Other measures include the establishment of risk prevention mechanisms , improving competitiveness , and so forth .  
Zeng Peiyan said : Implementing the proactive financial policy and increasing the issuance of long-term treasury bonds for construction projects is one of the key measures for effectively resisting Asian financial risks and maintaining a sustained , rapid and sound economic development .  
Judging from the possibilities , given the current rich material resources , abundant funds , fairly low prices , and the fact that the proportion of the balance of debts in the GDP and other targets are within the international safety warning line , China 's financial sector can withstand the strains .  
All the increase and reduction have expressed a kind of spirit of " seeking progress while ensuring stability . "  The budget has not done anything harmful to current social stability , economic recovery , or long-term healthy economic development , but has promoted what is conducive to improving the business environment , attracting foreign investment , and encouraging the training of capable personnel .  In this way , the increase and reduction of taxes and charges have been used to readjust the government 's financial revenue and expenditure and to promote social and economic development .  
At a time when Donald Tsang Yam-kuen is about to be relieved of his post as financial secretary and to take up a more important new post as chief secretary for administration , the Hong Kong people should commend his performance since Hong Kong 's return to China and should hope the principle of prudently handling financial affairs and keeping expenditures within the limits of revenue enshrined in the Basic Law will continue to be implemented and developed in the financial work of the special administrative region in the future .  
The western areas should proceed from their actual conditions , make full use of the preference policies of the state in shifting more financial input to the western areas , more effectively implement the strategy of " relying on science and education for national regeneration , " first make substantial developments in the fields of science and technology , education , infrastructure construction , and ecological environmental construction , and thus lay a solid foundation for comprehensive economic development and social progress in the future .  
Some leading cadres , in pursuit of achievements in their official careers , engage in numerical tricks , submit false statistics to the higher authorities , and force the lower levels for high statistical figures , giving rise to local boastfulness , wasting hosts of human , material , and financial resources , and ruining the people 's interests .  
This year , the procuratorial organizations will emphasize the supervision of investigation and prosecution , detection , hearing , and execution of punishment in criminal cases , and also the supervision of trial of civil and administrative cases .  Stress will be laid on preventing job related crimes in coordination with financial , securities , customs , medical and pharmaceutical , building and other trades .  
Peng Peiyun pointed out : Following the tax-for-fees reform , surcharge for education and social collection of funds have been canceled .  The income of township and town finance has decreased , and the new agricultural tax has not clearly stipulated the proportion of tax for compulsory education in rural areas .  The system of financial transfer by financial department at the higher level also has not been properly established .  
The volume of trade between the two sides accounts for 40 percent of Hong Kong 's foreign trade volume .  In the period of the " Tenth Five-Year Plan , " the volume of import and export trade of the mainland will increased to $ 680 billion , and a large part of the cargoes will be transported via Hong Kong . This will directly benefit Hong Kong 's economic development , and will be favorable to giving play to Hong Kong 's advantages as an international financial , trade , and shipping center .  
cheating on taxes or foreign exchange , smuggling , or fraudulent bidding practices in the construction sector have run rampant ; cases of violating financial or economic disciplines have persisted despite repeated prohibitions ; and major , serious , or even fatal accidents relating to production safety have also time and again broken , and these have inflicted grave losses on the state interests or people 's life or property ;  
The party and government organizations at all levels must set great store by building a contingent of political and legal affairs workers while the financial departments at all levels must provide political and legal affairs organs , administrative organs , as well as law enforcement organs with necessary funds so that such organs may more effectively crack down on all sorts of criminals and safeguard our market economic order or social stability .  
In accordance with the requirement of developing the socialist market economy and the principle of making financial authority correspond to administrative authority , it is necessary to rationally divide the financial authority and administrative authority of governments at all levels , enhance their functions of financial redistribution , improve the method of using central revenue to subsidize local expenditures , and gradually establish a standardized system of fiscal transfers of payments and improve the fiscal system .  
We should deepen reform of credit associations in rural areas and improve financial services .  We should continue the work of helping poor areas through development and formulate new plans to help poor areas .  We should lay stress on helping poor people in central and western regions resided by minority people , in old revolutionary base areas , and in border and especially poor areas .  
Zhang Zhongwei also listed other major objectives for the province 's economic and social development in the coming five years : The average annual increase in the province 's financial income will slightly exceed its GDP growth .  
The financial departments at all levels must guarantee funds for the " two supremes " in normal operation and must earnestly help departments involved in political and legal work in remote border areas , poor areas , or areas inhabited by ethnic minorities tackle the problem of lack of funds .  
Speaking on China 's economic situation in the past three years , Premier Zhu said , after the Asian financial crisis , China 's foreign trade export had dropped drastically , there had been an oversupply of principal industrial products , and 10 million workers of state-owned enterprises had to be laid off .  In face of such gigantic difficulties , China did not devaluate the RMB , nor did we sell state-owned properties .  Rather , what China did was make a resolute policy decision , adopting a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy .  
The Directorate General of Budget , Accounting and Statistics ( DGBAS ) says that 1989 was an important watershed in the ROC 's financial income and outlay .  During the 40 years from 1950 until 1989 , the central government accumulated a total of just NT $ 191 billion in debt , and was in a very stable financial situation .  During the same period , the ROC 's economic growth rate was unparalleled in the world , with an average annual growth rate of 8.9% .  
The Council for Economic Planning and Development statistics show that during the 1980s , the average annual taxes grew by 13.2% .  By the 90s , this figure had changed to a negative growth rate of - 5.2% .  In recent years , due to the promotion of the unified tax system , reductions in the taxes to the financial industry and similar tax reduction measures , since the 1999 tax year , tax income has experienced consistent negative growth rates .  
People of all sectors of Taiwan have pointed out that the Chen Shui-bian government has bent on pursuing Taiwan independence and has been unable to adhere to a correct policy , resulting in conflicts between Taiwan 's ruling and opposition parties , social confrontations , economic recession , deteriorating social order , financial and economic crises , and political instability , and even the government has been unable to practice its policies .  
It focuses on the implementation of a zero-base budget in a bid to bring into full play the role of macro-economic control of the budget .  In this way , it can gradually form a new budgetary system for the armed forces , in which financial power and financial resources are concentrated , military spending is scientifically distributed , budgetary items are specific and transparent , and supervision and restraint are tight .  
Following the Asian financial crisis , the United States saw that China 's image as a major power is developing in a " positive direction " and [ that China ] is a responsible and cooperative big power .  Enjoying economic prosperity and stability and the further elevation of its international standing , China occupies a rising position in the US global strategy .  Even US security and prosperity increasingly depends on the development of Sino-US relations .  
The Bush administration 's foreign-policy team is still intoxicated with irrational economic prosperity in the 1990s , and it has not yet realized that the biggest challenge the United States is going to face will not a military but an economic one ; the fatal weakness of the Bush administration is that its senior financial and economic officials lack the prestige to stabilize the confidence of Wall Street investors .  
After its return to the motherland , Hong Kong will retain the status of a free port and an international financial , trade and shipping centre while continuing to maintain and develop its economic and cultural relations with other countries , regions and relevant international organisations so that this international economic metropolis will forever be vigorous and dynamic .  
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region protects the right to own private property in accordance with law and may , on its own , formulate its economic , trade , monetary , financial , educational , scientific and technological , cultural and sports policies in accordance with law .  It will have independent finances , practise an independent taxation system and be a separate customs territory .  
On fiscal policy , Mr Kwong said : " Our sound financial position depends largely on our strict discipline in controlling expenditure and our efforts in maintaining a stable and productive revenue base .  
The Homepage depicts the work and objectives of the Economic Services Bureau on the various responsibilities under its purview , including agriculture and fisheries , civil aviation , energy supplies , financial monitoring of public utilities , maritime services , meteorological services , port development , postal services , protection of endangered species , telecommunications and tourism .  
These are a high savings rate , a dedicated and flexible labour force with good education and professional training , a well - established and properly supervised banking sector , advanced infrastructure for the financial markets , fiscal and monetary prudence , a government supporting the private sector but not imposing government leadership on economic development , and last but not the least , the rule of law . 
With the rapid and steady growth in the economy of Mainland China , Hong Kong as her premier international financial centre is likely to do much better in the years ahead in meeting the huge funding requirements of our motherland and in contributing to the modernisation of her financial systems .  
Noting that these were but a few examples of Hong Kong 's financial market development in the foreseeable future , he said the Government was committed to ensure that the software and hardware of our financial infrastructure were enhanced and sustained at the world-class level to meet challenges in the coming century . 
With the rapid and steady growth in the economy of Mainland China , Hong Kong as her premier international financial centre is likely to do much better in the years ahead in meeting the huge funding requirements of our motherland and in contributing to the modernisation of her financial system . "  
" Because of Hong Kong 's excellent infrastructure , robust financial market and its role as an international business hub , " said Mr Ho , " many overseas investors who wish to enter the Chinese market often finds it desirable to have a Hong Kong partner or to set up a regional office in Hong Kong . "  
" The Basic Law guarantees that Hong Kong will maintain its existing legal , social and economic systems .  It allows us to keep the existing freedoms and life style of our people ; it protects the right of private ownership ; retains for Hong Kong a separate currency and customs territory ; and it reaffirms our long established policies of prudent financial management and low taxation . "

Hong Kong is an international financial centre and also a major financing base for Mainland enterprises .  Since 1993 , a total of 34 Mainland enterprises have been listed in Hong Kong , raising more than HK $ 50 billion .  
Hong Kong is a city known throughout the world for its fast pace and in our financial market , every second counts .  Take our stock market as an example .  Although its turnover has repeatedly set record highs of late , the automatic trading system of the Stock Exchange can still maintain the rate of completing automatic matching within two seconds and the clearing and settlement systems of the stock and futures markets as well as the banks still operate properly .  
He emphasized that the long-standing objective of the Government was to maintain an overall environment favourable to economic growth , through providing a sound legal and institutional framework , a simple tax system with low tax rate , a stable financial sector , well - developed infrastructure and an efficient Government machinery .  
The four important pillars which underpinned Hong Kong 's economic success before the changeover , which are the rule of law , a level playing field for all who do business in Hong Kong , a corruption-free public service and free flow of information , have all remained to ensure Hong Kong 's continued success as it takes on its new role as China 's premier international financial centre . 
It allows us complete financial autonomy , and independence of our monetary system .  It establishes Hong Kong as a separate customs territory , and enables us to work directly with the international community to curb trade in strategic commodities , drugs , illegal trans-shipments , and protect intellectual property rights .  
Hong Kong , in its continued capacity as a free port and an international financial , trade and shipping center , will play an even more active role in strengthening the economic cooperation between China 's mainland and other countries in the world .  
The developed countries are advanced in science and technology and strong in financial capital , while the developing countries are rich in natural and human resources and large in market potential .  
The World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund , as the most influential multilateral financial institutions , will preserve their vigor and hold out a bright future only when they can undergo timely readjustments and reform in keeping with the new and shifting world situation and give expression to the reasonable demands of the developing countries .  
The Chief Executive said Hong Kong was fortunate , and had incomparable advantages , such as a high degree of autonomy under the ' One Country , Two Systems ' concept , abundant financial reserves , social and economic systems that worked well and a sound , comprehensive legal system .  
" We are the freest society and most vibrant economy of our time because Hong Kong has always practised free enterprise and free trade , insisted on prudent financial management policies and keeping a low taxation system , upheld the rule of law and placed emphasis on an efficient , executive-led government and a quality oriented civil service , " he said .  
Flexible mortgage arrangements will be negotiated with financial institutions ; the conditions of flats will be checked and essential renovation works carried out before sale ; a structural guarantee period will be provided ; Owners ' Corporations will be set up , maintenance funds will be established , partly with contribution from sale proceeds , and reasonable resale conditions will be drawn up , Mr Tung said .  
On Hong Kong 's position as a premier financial centre , Mr Tsang said this would be strengthened by increasing training , by greatly improved financial communications infrastructure ; and above all that , by maintaining the rule of law , freedom of information , low , simple and predictable tax rates and open markets .  
The IMF Mission noted that the existing policy framework , including the linked exchange rate system , prudent fiscal policy , careful supervision of the financial sector and non-interventionist approach in factor markets , has proved to be effective and resilient in withstanding external pressures on the Hong Kong market .  
In our view , the existing policy framework - which includes the linked exchange rate system , a prudent fiscal policy , the careful supervision of the financial sector , and a non-interventionist approach to factor markets - has been extremely successful in fostering strong and sustainable growth in the past . 
The Board supported the compilation of a complete BoP account for Hong Kong . This extension in statistical work represents Hong Kong 's further commitment to the international community in providing detailed and sufficient economic and financial statistics to investors around the world .  
Miss Yue said the negotiations on financial services were protracted and difficult .  She is therefore particularly pleased that the negotiations were concluded with a substantially improved package of offers with a very broad level of participation from both developed and developing members of the WTO .  
* to adopt a simpler and more gradual sliding scale for the standard legal aid scheme with the maximum contribution reduced from 43 per cent to 25 per cent of the aided person 's financial resources .  
Hong Kong has a sound and effective financial monitoring system ; ample fiscal reserves as well as prudent financial management policies .  The Government is free of any foreign debts .  Private firms also exercise financial prudence when seeking foreign loans .  
Our sound economic foundation , huge fiscal reserves and effective financial systems and monitoring mechanism are abundant proof of our capability to maintain the currency linkage .  
Mr Tung stressed that in the face of this financial situation , the Government 's most important task at hand was to take firm and resolute measures to safeguard the stability of Hong Kong 's economic system .  To achieve this , it was vital for us to defend the linked exchange rate , and the Government was determined to do so .  
" Our sound economic foundation , huge fiscal reserves and effective financial systems and monitoring mechanism are abundant proof of our capability to maintain the currency linkage .  
We weathered successive waves of a tumultuous financial storm .  We also controlled the spread of a potentially dangerous avian flu . "  
In releasing the Report by the Informal Working Group today ( Thursday ) , Mr Tsang said : " To maintain Hong Kong 's status as a premier international financial centre in a very competitive environment , it is imperative that we should have an efficient and robust financial infrastructure .  
Mr Wong pointed out that new initiatives would be introduced in eight key areas to further improve the quality of basic education .  The eight areas include QEF , biliteracy and trilingualism , information technology in education , improving the learning environment , improving the quality of teachers , catering for special education needs , administrative support to schools ; and financial assistance for needy students .  
As regards financial assistance to needy students , it comes under two main categories : ( i ) travel subsidy will be provided to about 19,000 needy public sector primary school pupils residing outside Primary One Admission Nets at a recurrent cost of $ 22.7 million a year , and ( ii ) the School Textbook Assistance Scheme will be extended to benefit about 100,000 Secondary 4 to 7 students at a recurrent cost of $ 74 million .  
" Of this , $ 16.2 billion comes from higher than expected receipts from stamp duty , reflecting the exceptional level of turnover in both the stock and property markets in the first half of the financial year . 
Reiterating the Government 's firm commitment to establish Mandatory Provident Fund schemes to give the working population a viable and sustainable retirement benefit system , Mr Tsang said he intended to use the tax system to help the development of secure provision for the financial needs of the retired in future . 
Mr Tong admitted that the unwavering stance taken to protect the peg had brought about short term problems , such as increases in interest rates , but with a solid economic foundation , a huge fiscal reserve and a sound financial and monitoring system , Hong Kong is confident that it will be among the first - - if not the first - - to rebound .  
" Of course , our US $ 92.8 billion foreign reserves , the third largest in the world , and our healthy banking and financial systems as well as our strong economic fundamentals , have all played a vital role in enabling us to maintain the linked exchange rate , " he said .  
Mr Tong admitted that the unwavering stance taken to protect the peg had brought about short term problems , such as increases in interest rates , but with a solid economic foundation , a huge fiscal reserve and a sound financial and monitoring system , Hong Kong is confident that it will be among the first - if not the first - to rebound . 
Mr Little said that apart from legal co-operation arrangements , the Basic Law also authorises the Hong Kong SAR to enter into binding international agreements with foreign States and international organisations in various fields including economic , trade , financial and monetary , shipping , communications , tourism , cultural and sport .  
" Second , the financial situation in Korea has stabilised because the world finally realised that financial crises can not be solved by official funds alone , but a combination of IMF funding and conditionality , plus voluntary rollovers provided by international banking institutions .  This appears to be the right way forward .  
He said that while the financial turmoil had forced other countries to cut back on infrastructure and social programmes , Hong Kong 's excellent finances - with fiscal reserves of more than HK $ 450 billion - were allowing it to push ahead with massive investments .  
The Government has considered the relevant issues and has no reason to believe that the case offends Hong Kong 's constitutional system or notions of substantial justice and would be likely to have a significant and adverse effect on Hong Kong 's trade with the overseas jurisdiction concerned or on Hong Kong 's financial system .  
" I think , if anything , Hong Kong represents a model of economic management others in Asia are now realising they should try to follow : a free market under the rule of law ; a clean government which believes in prudent financial management and in not directing the economy ; a well-regulated and well-managed financial sector ; a reputation for playing by the rules ; openness and accountability , " Mr Tsang concluded .  
During the recent financial turmoil in Asia , the Government of the HKSAR , with its stable public finances and healthy fiscal reserves , has formulated on its own appropriate measures to deal with the problem and has successfully maintained the stability of the linked exchange rate .  Hong Kong continues to prosper and maintain its status as a leading international shipping , trade , financial and business centre .  
" Members are appointed in their personal capacity , and include professionals , financial administrators , businessmen , academics , social workers , public rental housing and subsidised home ownership flat residents , and members of the Executive Council , Provisional Urban Council , Provisional Regional Council and Provisional District Boards , " Mr Wong said .  
First and foremost because for years we have practised very prudent sound financial policies .  Year after year , since the linked exchange rate was established , our fiscal reserves every year average about 2% of GDP . And in the year just closed , March 31 , 1998 , our budget surplus was a full 5.8% of GDP .  
He stressed that Hong Kong 's solid economic foundation , strong fiscal reserves as well as sound banking and financial practices are the principal factors that will help Hong Kong recover sooner than most of its neighbours .  
Our confidence in Hong Kong 's prosperous future has not been eroded by the Asian financial turmoil .  In the coming five years , the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will invest HK $ 235 billion in a wide range of large-scale infrastructural projects , including the construction of railways , highways and educational facilities , to consolidate further the foundation for the long term development of Hong Kong and for the enhancement of Hong Kong 's competitiveness .  
" The currency turmoil is telling us how and why our wealth could be cut by half because of weaknesses in the financial intermediation process in Asia which made us vulnerable to volatile speculative capital flows , " said Mr Yam .  
Third , Hong Kong 's financial market has been very active in developing securities derivative products relating to mainland enterprises .  It has been able to provide a wide variety of financial products and make red chips and H-shares more attractive to institutional investors , thereby deepening the market for red chips and H-shares .  
" I hope the guests here will have a more comprehensive understanding of Hong Kong 's financial market through this seminar .  I would also like to see that many more companies in Dalian will have their shares traded on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong in future .  This will be a great step forward in the relations between the two important economic centres in north and south China , " she added .  
" We have in place a business friendly environment , a prudent fiscal policy , a simple tax system with low tax rates , a sound financial system , first-class infrastructure and sophisticated support services .  
" All the favourable conditions in Hong Kong which have underpinned our robust development in the past , such as our prudent financial policy , low taxation , sound financial and banking regulation , first-rate infrastructural facilities are still there and unaffected by external factors . " 
This is underpinned in particular by sustained high economic growth and further reform and opening up in the Mainland will provide ample opportunities for Hong Kong . Additionally , our past prudent financial management has produced very strong fiscal reserve which will provide a solid base for a strong recovery in a not too distant future . "  
Our attractions are manifold .  Among those most commonly cited are our superb physical infrastructure , our simple tax regime and low tax rates , our well developed financial support services and regulatory system , the rule of law and in general a very business-friendly environment .  
Furthermore , there are the rule of law , a low and predictable tax regime , an efficient and honest civil service , free flow of information and an efficient and sound financial system .  
" Events during the last 15 years have demonstrated how Hong Kong and the dollar link have weathered the storm - the 1987 stock market crash , the 1989 June 4 incident in Beijing , the 1990 Gulf War , the 1995 Mexican peso crisis , and now the Asian financial crunch .  " Today , it is the only freely convertible currency in the region that has survived the turmoil unscathed , " Mrs Chan said .  Mrs Chan went on to talk about our impressive track record of exchange rate stability .  
The Chief Secretary for Administration also noted other vital elements for maintaining confidence in Hong Kong as an international financial centre - a small , competent and clean administration ; a sophisticated currency board system which protected the linked currency exchange rate ; a sound monetary system , a well supervised and generally healthy banking sector ; tight fiscal discipline ; surplus budgets and strong reserves .  
It allows us complete financial autonomy , and the independence of our monetary system .  It establishes Hong Kong as a separate customs territory , and enables us to work directly with the international community to control trade in strategic commodities , drugs , illegal transhipments , and to protect intellectual property rights .  
It has been pointed out that in the late 80s and early 90s , the capacity and willingness of Western financial institutions to reach out for more exotic high-yielding investment made private sectors of major emerging economies with strong growth potential their prime target . 
Our robust financial system and monetary management mechanism , modern and prudent supervision have laid a solid foundation for a stable exchange rate .  
Our robust financial system and monetary management mechanism , modern and prudent supervision as well as sophisticated financial infrastructure have laid a solid foundation for a stable exchange rate .  
But I can say for sure that our financial foundation is very solid , our monetary system is robust , our currency , backed up by the currency board arrangement , is stable .  Our policies to stick to the linked exchange rate system and prudent fiscal management will remain unchanged .  
In order to maintain the total number of general holidays ( other than Sundays ) at the present level of 17 days a year , a consultation exercise was held earlier this year , when employers ' and employees ' organisations , the financial services sector and religious bodies were asked to advise which existing general but not statutory holidays should be used to offset the new general holidays for Labour Day and the Buddha 's Birthday .  
While I do not dispute the conceptual validity of this argument , I must point out that when we are faced with real and mounting financial problems with dangerous repercussions , speedy and decisive corrective action is essential for preventing a widespread systemic collapse .  
In macro terms , this means greater transparency and disclosure , greater accountability , stronger domestic financial systems , liberal trade , open financial markets , a high quality of regulation , and independent legal processes .  
The challenge ahead is to promote shared growth , to forestall future crises , and to design a new international financial architecture that promotes resilient financial systems , efficient global resource allocation and a level playing field .  
Indeed , Hong Kong has run into unprecedented problems .  Yet we also enjoy today a number of advantages , such as huge fiscal reserves , prudent financial management policies , a sound monetary system , strong development on the mainland as our backup and a high degree of autonomy , which we have never had before .  
However , with the entrepreneurial spirit of the Hong Kong people , expanding economy of the Mainland together with the traditional prudent financial management , sound banking system , huge foreign exchange reserve that support a stable exchange rate , we continue to look forward to our future with confidence .  
" We represent the model of sound economic management in the region : a truly free market operating under the rule of law ; a well-regulated financial sector ; and a clean government that has exercised great prudence in fiscal management , " he said .  
The statement found that an additional 80 ha of land would need to be reclaimed in the Central and Wanchai Districts for constructing key transport infrastructure ; transforming the existing waterfront to make it more accessible for the enjoyment and use of the public ; and providing space for the future expansion of the Central Business District to enable Hong Kong to continue to maintain its role as a highly competitive international financial and services centre .  
These systems include the rule of law ; a level playing field for doing business ; a corruption-free and politically-neutral civil service ; open and transparent financial markets ; a fast and unfettered flow of information network and last but not least , a tried and tested policy of limiting Government spending to within the trend growth rate of Gross Domestic Product .  
" I have maintained close contact with international business and financial leaders in order to have a better grasp of the current global economic climate .  I also explain to them the purpose of our policies , in particular those implemented and being planned for the financial markets . "  
However , in view of the fact that the Scheme has been in existence for just a short while , we consider it more appropriate for the Scheme to operate for a longer period of time to allow the relevant government departments as well as financial institutions and small and medium enterprises participating in the Scheme alike to accumulate adequate practical experience for areas for improvement to be identified .  
It is learnt that Hongkong Telecom was in breach of the provisions of its licence some time ago by offering discounts to its IDD call customers without the prior authorisation of the Telecommunications Authority . A financial penalty was imposed on Hongkong Telecom as a result and the company was required to recover the shortfalls between the approved rates and the unauthorised discounted rates from the customers concerned .  
The meetings covered a wide range of topics including the need for more transparency in international capital flows , the East Asian financial crisis , Japan 's economic performance , the upcoming World Bank / IMF meeting in Washington , Hong Kong 's role as an international financial centre and the successful implementation of the ' one country , two systems concept ' .  
Talks focused on looming global economic problems , disparities between the speed at which financial markets have developed and the regulatory frameworks governing such activities , China 's emergence as a global economic power and its role as a stabilising factor within Asia , and the impact of the Euro on Asian and global financial markets .  
The Financial Secretary , Mr Donald Tsang , says there is a growing consensus among Hong Kong 's major trading partners that there needs to be ' quick and decisive ' efforts to deal with the current global economic and financial crisis .  
Given sustained expansion and hence demand for capital on the Mainland , as well as the recovery of our economy , Mr Tung said he expected the overall size of our stock market to increase as the current global financial uncertainties receded .

While we will exert ourselves in achieving this objective , I believe that we also need to take account , in my view , of four main factors which will be crucial to our recovery .  These are : an improvement in the external , financial and economic environment ; a steadying of our interest rates here ; stability in the property market ; and above all , a return of public confidence .  
In conclusion , Mr Tong explained that in spite of the projected negative growth rate of 4 per cent for 1998 , the territory with its vast fiscal reserves , and sound financial and monetary system , will be able to ride out the storm and continue with the implementation of its major infrastructure projects .  
Although the accumulated reserves of HK $ 450 billion gave Hong Kong the financial strength to tide over present difficulties , the Government must find the resources to continue to invest in the future , and to provide the modern infrastructure in supporting Hong Kong 's role as a major economic player on the world stage , she said .  
He stressed that Hong Kong 's economic fundamentals were very strong , and together with its huge foreign currency reserves , a stable currency , and excellent financial and banking systems , the territory 's recovery from the downturn would be amongst the first in the region . 
The government has faced criticism about its economic forecasts .  Some have said - that we have been complacent , myopic , unable to keep track on development and inaccurate in our forecasts .  We estimate that GDP will contract about 4% in 1998 .  This is a substantial downward adjustment on the figures released in the Budget when the full scope of the Asian financial crisis was not yet known .  
Domestic financial laxity and economic policy distortions were common factors in Asia . The wild swings of fast-flowing and highly-leveraged speculative capital in narrower emerging markets led to strong overshoots which were highly destabilising and severely eroded investor and consumer confidence .  
Given both the cost of the relief measures announced on June 22 , and the effects of the current global financial crisis , we expect the budget deficit for the current year to be substantially in excess of $ 20 billion , which will entail an equivalent reduction in the level of the fiscal reserves .  
" The financial position of Hong Kong 's banking system and the quality of the regulatory and supervisory system are very strong by international standards , and that the impact of the regional crisis on the banking system will be manageable " , said Ms Wanda Tseng , Deputy Director of the Asia and Pacific Department who was in Hong Kong with the Mission .  
( c ) whether measures will be adopted to narrow down the current differential between the deposit rate and the lending rate to the 2 per cent level which was the prevailing interest rate spread prior to the financial turmoil ; if so , what the details are ; if not , why not ; and  
The dialogue on the financial crisis covered several topics , which included the strengthening of financial and legal systems , recapitalising banks affected by bad debts , the use of savings to build domestic bond and securities markets and ways to guard against contagion during regional economic turmoil .  
" The financial position of Hong Kong 's banking system and the quality of the regulatory and supervisory system are very strong by international standards , and that the impact of the regional crisis on the banking system will be manageable " , said Ms Wanda Tseng , Deputy Director of the Asia and Pacific Department who was in Hong Kong with the Mission .  
These included Japan 's economic recovery packages , financial and corporate sector restructuring , providing a catalyst for private capital flows , economic and technical co-operation , electronic commerce and ways to strengthen human resource development , economic infrastructure and the science and technological base .  
" We are a model of sound economic management , with a free market operating under the rule of law , a well-regulated financial sector and a clean government that exercises prudence in its fiscal policies .  
In addition , we are also committed to work closely with the market regulators including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority and the SFC to maintain a proper and modern regulatory regime in Hong Kong , and through them with overseas regulators on the promotion of international co-operation and best international practices on regulation of financial markets .  
" Hong Kong is a commercial and financial centre with distinctive architectural landmarks of high professional standard , " he said .  " The Bank of China Tower , the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Building , and the Convention and Exhibition Centre are superb landmarks on the Hong Kong skyline , indicative of the vibrancy and the attractiveness of this city , " Dr Leung said , " These are balanced by buildings with historical significance , such as the Western Market and the Flagstaff House Museum of Tea Ware , "  
These include a well developed financial infrastructure , a conducive regulatory environment and sound supervisory process , free and open markets , a modern and effective legal system and a high degree of transparency .  
Miss Chan said a few underlying principles must be observed in considering the four options .  They are : ( 1 ) the aim to save jobs and improve unemployment ; ( 2 ) the need to ensure employees ' statutory entitlements are not impaired ; ( 3 ) that the PWIF must stay financially sound at all times and ( 4 ) that no public funds should be used to finance the PWIF should it run into financial difficulties as a result of payment made to employees in cases of corporate rescue .  
The spokesman explained that the distinct narrowing in the visible trade deficit in 1998 reflected the adjustment in domestic demand upon the impact of the regional financial turmoil , which led to a marked decline in imports retained for local use .  
While Hong Kong has not been immune from the severe impact of the regional financial turmoil , with our sound economic fundamentals and robust financial and fiscal systems , we should be able to recover speedily when the global and regional situation improves . 
A stable and efficient debt market provides an effective avenue for Governments and enterprises to raise capital .  It is critical to the steady development of the financial industries as well as to the overall stability of the regional economies .  
( a ) whether , apart from giving hearing tests to all Primary One students at present , it provides such tests for primary and secondary school students in the regular medical examination conducted every year ; if it does , what the sense of hearing of students in Hong Kong is , as indicated in the results of those hearing tests in the past three years ; if not , the reasons for not providing such tests and whether they are related to administrative , technical and financial difficulties ; and  
A spokesman for the Health and Welfare Bureau said these guardians would make important decisions affecting the daily life of mentally incapacitated persons , such as deciding where they should live , controlling their financial affairs , as well as giving consent on their behalf for medical and dental treatment .  
The IMF also commended the Government 's consistent record of fiscal prudence , observing that the accumulation of substantial fiscal reserves had played an important role in sustaining confidence in financial markets , and had significantly increased the Government 's room for manoeuvre in the current economic downturn .  
Directors commended the Hong Kong SARG 's consistent record of fiscal prudence , observing that the accumulation of substantial fiscal reserves had played an important role in sustaining confidence in financial markets , and had significantly increased the Hong Kong SARG 's room for maneuver in the current economic downturn .  
Turning to social welfare , Mrs Fok said the $ 29.1 billion recurrent expenditure for 1999 / 2000 represented 14.1 per cent of the total Government recurrent expenditure and a real growth of 13.6 per cent over the figure for the current financial year .  
The Government has already allocated a very substantial proportion of public funds to the welfare sector on an annual basis , in terms of capital and recurrent resources .  In the financial year 1999 / 2000 , the subvention for direct services will rise to $ 6.2 billion from $ 5.4 billion .  
Three categories of prospective tenants are eligible for the new scheme : Waiting List ( WL ) applicants who are due for flat allocation in the coming financial year ; Temporary Housing / Cottage Areas and squatter clearees who have satisfied prevailing PRH eligibility criteria ; and junior civil servants under the Civil Service Public Housing Quota and Estate Assistants of the Housing Department due for allocation in the coming year .  
Their governing bodies and executive management are responsible for maintaining the financial well-being of their respective entities , including keeping the capital costs of projects under construction under tight control , lowering the operating costs of completed projects where justified , and revising the annual business plans as necessary in order to achieve the target rate of return over a period of time .  
integrated radio systems for mobile phone and paging services ; broadband ATM switch , mini telephone exchange and satellite transmission equipment ; a full range of telecommunications services , i.e . data , voice , Internet , satellite , etc . ; access to financial data and information databases ; centralised uninterrupted power supply for small businesses ; and backup generators for essential applications .  
For example , Article 109 provides that the HKSAR government shall maintain the status of Hong Kong as an international financial centre .  Article 110 provides that the HKSAR government shall , on its own , formulate monetary and financial policies .  Article 111 prescribes that the Hong Kong dollar , as the legal tender in the HKSAR , shall continue to circulate .  Article 112 states that no foreign exchange control policies shall be applied in the HKSAR and that the Hong Kong dollar shall be freely convertible .  
Article 113 stipulates that the Exchange Fund of the HKSAR shall be managed and controlled by the government of the HKSAR . It is unusual to have such detailed specifications in a constitutional law , but the transfer of sovereignty is a significant change and it is helpful to retain those effective features that contribute to Hong Kong 's success as an international financial centre in the form of constitutional law .  
When raising funds in Hong Kong , mainland entities are treated as other international and local market participants .  Mainland companies listed in Hong Kong are required to abide by security laws of Hong Kong and are regulated by the relevant regulatory authorities in Hong Kong . Disputes relating to financial transactions are handled in accordance with international practice .  Where China 's Arbitration Law and other relevant laws and regulations are applicable according to the terms of a contract , the provisions relating to arbitration involving foreign parties are applied .  
During this period we encountered the severest financial crisis in many years , sustaining the great pain brought on by the economic adjustments .  Nevertheless we are also pleased that with the smooth implementation of the Basic Law , the " one country , two systems " principle has gained recognition not only from the local public , but also the international community and overseas investors .  
The long term financial sustainability of the current system is highly questionable , having regard to the aging population , the increased costs associated with adoption of new technology and the rising public expectation for quality services . 
While your visit on this occasion is all too short , I hope that in the brief time available you can get an appreciation of what Hong Kong is today - a city that 's proud to be reunited with China , a city confidently moving ahead to overcome the fallout from the Asian financial turmoil , and a hard-working people , like the Dutch , who have fashioned a dynamic environment which successfully blends the cultures of the east and the west . 
By early 2000 , the first set of complete annual BoP account with detailed components for both the current account and the capital and financial account will be available for the reference year of 1998 .  A quarterly series will also be produced .  
Hong Kong 's economic fundamentals remain strong .  These include , inter alia , the Mainland as our economic hinterland , robust financial and banking systems , a huge foreign exchange reserve , a sound legal system , a simple tax system with low tax rates , a clean government and efficient transport and communications facilities .  All these factors contribute towards the maintenance of our competitiveness .  
Under the proposal , Lloyd 's will be subject to the regulatory requirements applicable to other authorised insurers , including requirements with respect to solvency margin , local assets , fit and proper management , financial reporting and regulation of its insurance agents , with suitable modifications in recognition of its unique mode of operation and accounting system . 
Two years ago , gloomy scenarios were being painted - not about an Asian financial crisis - but about the impending demise of Hong Kong 's monetary autonomy under Chinese rule : about the breaking of the link between the Hong Kong dollar and the U.S . dollar , the absorption of Hong Kong 's substantial foreign reserves by the Mainland , and so on .  
The practical and theoretical considerations involved in deciding on an appropriate exchange rate system can be reduced to four broad factors : the external versus domestic orientation of the economy ; the flexibility of its cost-price structure ; the exposure to financial shocks ; and the reputation and credibility of policy makers .  
There is a school of thought that maintains that mobile international capital can play a useful global role as a sort of ' policeman ' of sound policies .  The theory is that , in a liberalised global financial system , international capital flows reward countries with sound economic policies and punish those which pursue unbalanced and inconsistent policies .  
At the Financial Conference on Asia organised by the Trade Development Council today ( Thursday ) , Secretary for Financial Services , Mr Rafael Hui , in his speech entitled " What follows the Financial Turmoil " , warned that history would repeat itself without the joint effort of the international community in reforming the global financial architecture , and formulating new rules and strategies to cope with the massive and volatile capital flows in our globalised economy .  
The Government also reaffirmed the plan to consolidate the existing 12 pieces of securities-related legislation into one , with the intention to provide a more transparent and coherent regulatory framework and more effective regulation in an increasingly sophisticated and fast changing financial market .  
The rapid development of Bahrain 's financial industry is largely attributed to its favourable business environment .  It has a stable legal administrative framework and sophisticated financial and physical infrastructure .  
" The proposed framework covers different essential elements including effective financial crisis management , prudent risk management , proper corporate governance to strike a right balance between its commercial interest and the wider public interest , general regulation that ensures NewCo operates appropriately and prudently , and shareholding limit to ensure a truly diversified ownership , " the spokesman said .  
She emphasised that the progress of the financial services sector in Hong Kong in dealing with the Y2K problem had been satisfactory .  To date , all supervised financial institutions , such as banks , finance companies , exchanges members and insurance companies , have already reported to their respective regulators that they have completed rectification work of all their mission-critical systems , including testing of individual systems and the interfaces between the systems .  
Volatile capital flows and defects in the international financial architecture have been an important component of the crisis , but it is clear enough from the summary I have given that many of the problems are closer to home and institutional in nature : lending excesses , poor risk management , political interference , weak supervision , lack of transparency , and so on .  
No matter what forms of international monitoring and regulation might arise out of the discussions that are currently in progress , domestic financial systems will remain the basic building blocks of the international financial system for the foreseeable future , particularly in a region as politically and economically diverse as Asia . 
In Hong Kong we were fortunate to have in place prior to the Asian financial crisis a sound regulatory infrastructure , strong and well capitalised banks , disclosure standards comparable to the best in the world , and effective liquidation laws .  
Speaking at a passing-out parade at the Police Training School today ( Saturday ) , Mr Chau said good social order , a stable investment environment , an independent judiciary and rigorous enforcement by law enforcement agencies were indispensable for Hong Kong to maintain its status as an industrial and business centre , a financial centre as well as a cosmopolitan city .  
" Hong Kong needs to have a modern and flexible regulatory framework to strengthen our competitive edge amidst rapid changes in the international financial markets , " Mr Rafael S Y Hui , the acting Financial Secretary said , " A reform to our existing legislation governing the securities and futures markets is urgently needed . "  
He also considered that the most productive focus for international and national economic reforms lay in the four key areas of strengthening financial markets , reducing vulnerability to short term capital flows , promoting greater transparency at all levels , and involving private creditors in debt resolution arrangements .  
In his opening remarks , Mr Joseph Yam , Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said : " The crises over the past two years have taught us that , no matter how well maintained the domestic financial environment may be , serious problems persist in what has proved to be an increasingly volatile international financial system .  These problems can not be resolved by individual economies on their own .  
The Government remains firmly committed to maintaining the rule of law , efficient public administration , prudent fiscal policy , simple tax system with low tax rate , sound financial system , first-class infrastructure and sophisticated support services , so as to preserve and wherever possible lift further Hong Kong 's competitive position in the world .  
It allows us complete financial autonomy , and independence of our monetary system .  It establishes the Hong Kong SAR as a separate customs territory , and enables us to work directly with the international community to curb trade in strategic commodities , drugs , illegal transshipments , and infringement of intellectual property rights .  
Both exchanges ' ruling bodies believe that the market reform as proposed by the Financial Secretary of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is vital to the future development of Hong Kong 's financial services industry and that it will be critical to maintain and strengthen further Hong Kong 's position as a global financial centre in the increasingly competitive international securities and derivatives market .  
As Loco-London gold trading are not subject to any financial regulatory regime , the companies are not obliged to keep proper audit trail .  Moreover , the victims signed their contracts without the presence of independent witnesses allowing the companies to easily negate liability from the victims ' losses and make prosecutions more difficult .  
Topics covered during the 75-minute ABAC session included lessons from the Asian financial crisis , sustainable economic growth , accelerated trade liberalisation , APEC 's contribution to the WTO , the development of a policy framework to cope with a competitive global economy , the abolition of subsidies on food products within APEC and Y2K readiness .  
Maintaining monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong , continuing to improve the regulatory framework , improving the infrastructure required for a first class international financial centre and spearheading the further development of the financial markets are targets that we are committed to achieve .  
The spokesman appealed to the SSA staff to follow the civil service team to uphold their duties and responsibilities under limited resources in the benefit of the general public , especially the social security recipients were mostly the elderly , the disabled and those in need of urgent financial assistance .  
He also pointed out four challenges that the new millennium would bring to the financial market : the advance of information technology and the proliferation of internet applications ; the growing importance of institutional investors that caused fundamental changes to many aspects of the capital market ; the growing demand for cross-border financial transactions that has raised challenges for market regulators everywhere ; the emergence of a globalised market place that are linked by ever-expanding telecommunications technology which led to ever-growing cross-border financing activities .  
Financial liberalisation became very much the fashion , leading to domestic financial markets rapidly attaining a global dimension , welcoming and absorbing international capital .  
Mr Yam identified the areas to be considered for the building of a stronger financial system as : prudent management of the international financial architecture , international reform in financial disclosure and regulation , and regional monetary co-operation .  
" The Advisers believe that Hong Kong is well placed to capitalise on its position as a global financial centre , given our strengths , quality physical infrastructure , resourcefulness of human capital and unique economic links with the Mainland , " he said . 
The interest rate trend in the United States and the ensuing implications for its stock market and overall demand warrant close monitoring .  The economic recovery in Japan is yet to become more entrenched .  The process of financial reform and corporate restructuring in many of the crisis-hit East Asian economies will have to continue in order to sustain their growth in the time ahead .  
The interest rate trend in the United States and the ensuing implications for its stock market and overall demand warrant close monitoring .  The economic recovery in Japan is yet to become more entrenched .  The process of financial reform and corporate restructuring in many of the crisis-hit East Asian economies will have to continue in order to sustain their growth in the time ahead .  
Although there is a premium for doing business in Hong Kong , as with New York or London , he said the premium here was justified by our advantages : our location , world-class banking , financial services and infrastructure ; free market philosophy ; strong legal system based on the common law ; highly-developed services culture and economy which ranges across the whole services spectrum etc .  
With our unique attributes , including an internationally oriented financial and commercial system , a sound legal system and first-class air and cargo facilities , the Hong Kong business sector should continue to have an active role to play in the process of cross-strait market liberalization , provided that it can continue to adjust and adapt itself in providing high quality and high value-added services with a view to capitalizing on the business opportunities available .  
Other factors found favourable by an overwhelming majority ( i.e . 85% or more ) of respondents are : banking and financial facilities , tax regime , infrastructure , cleanliness of government , availability of managerial skill , geographical location , availability of professional / technical skill and adequacy of supporting services .  
( ii ) the total number of civil proceedings for damages instituted by members of the public who suffered financial losses as a result of negligence or fraudulent acts on the part of practising solicitors , and the number of cases in which the court ruled in favour of the plaintiffs , as well as the average amount of damages awarded ; and  
The Government has two objectives in introducing the Bill : one is to enhance the transparency of the insurance market in Hong Kong by allowing the Insurance Authority to disclose financial and statistical information of individual insurers when it is in the interests of the insuring public to do so ; the other is to cater for the needs of overseas insurers by empowering the Insurance Authority to accept actuarial standards which are comparable to those prescribed by legislation for compliance by the appointed actuaries of long-term business insurers .  
I am confident that with an active financial market , a thriving tourist industry , enhanced foreign trade , the gathering momentum of technological developments as well as the momentous development of China 's forthcoming accession to the World Trade Organisation , we can be cautiously optimistic about the medium and long-term economic prospects of Hong Kong .  
" Apart from the obvious social benefits , the MPF system will have a significant impact on stimulating economic growth .  And Hong Kong 's status as a premier international financial centre will receive a great shot in the arm , " Mr . Lee concluded .  
In the past three financial years as well as the current one ( four financial years ) , the total expenditure of the Government , the former provisional municipal councils and the Housing Authority on public works is about $ 188 billion , i.e . $ 47 billion per year on average .  
In the race into the knowledge economy , Mr Tung expected that the middle class would benefit most relative to the rest as knowledge , brain power , or innovative human capital , was worth more than physical or financial capital in a knowledge economy . 
Given the increasingly volatile and potentially destabilising nature of international capital flows , as was clearly demonstrated during the Asian financial crisis , the very substantial foreign reserves held by the Exchange Fund provided the foundation which enabled us to fend off very severe speculative attacks and retain public confidence on Hong Kong 's monetary and financial systems .  
Mr Wong noted that the Government would allocate an additional $ 1.24 billion in the coming financial year for the new initiatives on education and manpower , of which $ 300 million would be spent on promoting employment and encouraging continuing education , $ 140 million to help needy students and $ 800 million for implementing the education reform .  
As compared with the current financial year , the total education expenditure represents an increase of 4.1 per cent in nominal terms and four per cent in real terms .  Of the $ 54.4 billion , $ 36.1 billion ( 66.4 per cent ) will be on basic education , $ 18.3 billion ( 33.6 per cent ) be on tertiary education .  
This is particularly relevant to Hong Kong as an international financial centre where non-domestic financial business and movements in portfolio capital unrelated to economic developments intrinsic to Hong Kong are abundant .  
Commenting on the operating results of the Exchange Fund for 1999 , the Chief Executive of the HKMA , Mr Joseph Yam , said that the 20% increase in accumulated surplus was encouraging , particularly in a very difficult year when rising interest rates resulted in volatile financial conditions .  
We took decisive and resolute measures .  With the perseverance of the entire community , our financial market has retained stability and maintained steady development .  The economy has moved out of recession and has resumed a steady growth path .  
" Good social order , a stable investment environment , an independent judiciary and rigorous enforcement of the laws by law enforcement agencies are indispensable for Hong Kong to maintain its status as a leading business and trade centre , a world-class financial centre as well as a cosmopolitan city . "  
Mrs Chu said : " The victims of domestic violence need a comprehensive range of support services , such as clinical psychological services , housing arrangement , legal assistance , financial assistance , job placement and medical services , to help them overcome trauma and resume normal functioning . "  " Thus , the ' one-stop ' service approach is to ensure that the victims and their family members will get what they need as soon as possible through strengthening coordination with other government departments , non-governmental organisations and related professionals . "  
This was considerably larger than the net non-reserve financial outflow of $ 2.7 billion in the first quarter , possibly due to an increase in direct investment outflow as the regional economic environment progressively improved .  
The positive BoP position was mainly underpinned by the improvement in the current account , as Hong Kong 's exports strengthened while imports were restrained .  This reflected the adjustment process continuing in the economy to restore external balance after the Asian financial turmoil .  
" Local professional bodies , regulatory institutions and the government will monitor the development of the markets and take necessary measures to keep our regulatory regime up to date and abreast with the global trend .  Above all , we will strike a proper balance between the protection of the rights of investors and assistance rendered to the emerging enterprises so as to ensure that our financial industries will continue to flourish in the new economy , " she stressed .  
" It has been the government 's established policy to ensure an efficient and orderly operation of the financial market and the financial services sector , to provide an open and fair business environment which is favourable for market development , and to maintain and enhance Hong Kong 's status as a major international financial centre .  
But as markets attained a global dimension , encouraged by financial liberalisation and the advance of information technology , they became far less tolerant of weaknesses than before , and the markets responded to weaknesses with harsh punishments , which many considered grossly unfair . 
This is examining the environmental , engineering , financial and operational aspects of alternative plans for the sewage system serving the main urban areas in order to make recommendations on the most sustainable way forward .  
Recommending this newsletter to members of the public and the insurance sector , the Commissioner of Insurance , Mr Benjamin Tang , today ( May 21 ) said : " Insurance plays a vital role in Hong Kong 's daily life .  It provides protection against unexpected financial losses , facilitates trade , supplements public social benefits and mobilises savings . "  " To facilitate development of the insurance industry , a sound regulatory framework must be in place to ensure the financial health and integrity of the insurance market .  
In the foreword of the Hong Kong Police Review 1999 , which was published today ( May 21 ) , Mr Hui noted that the continuing climate of economic uncertainty and social hardship resulting from the Asian financial crisis had an inevitable effect on both the number and types of crimes committed , with continued evidence of increased crime related to the downturn in the economy , including cases of criminal intimidation related to debt-collecting malpractices and quick-cash crimes such as pick-pocketing and snatching . 
The Insurance Companies ( Amendment ) Bill 2000 serves two purposes : one is to enhance the transparency of the insurance market in Hong Kong by allowing the Insurance Authority ( IA ) to disclose financial and statistical information of individual insurers when it is in the interests of the insuring public to do so ; the other is to cater for the needs of overseas insurers by empowering the IA to accept actuarial standards which are comparable to those prescribed by legislation for compliance by the appointed actuaries of long term business insurers .  
( a ) the situation will arise in which the fiscal reserves deposited by the Government in the Exchange Fund will be frozen and can not be withdrawn in order to pay for public expenditure , when a substantial amount of the assets of the Exchange Fund has been utilised for stabilizing the monetary and financial systems of Hong Kong ;  
These changes included strengthening the monetary system to provide a greater buffer against attacks on the currency ; strengthening the banking system ; improving market regulations and stimulating the merger and demutualisation of the stock and futures exchanges ; closing loopholes in legislation ; and making the financial system far more open and transparent .  
Within the total factor income outflow , DII rebounded to a significant increase of 49.7% in 1999 , reflecting a distinct pick-up in earnings from direct investment in Hong Kong , particularly by those companies engaged in banking and other financial businesses , as the local economic situation improved .  
( a ) given that the Special Finance Scheme for Small and Medium Enterprises ( SFS ) has stopped accepting new applications since April 8 , 2000 , when the processing of the outstanding applications for credit guarantees under the SFS is expected to be completed ; and whether it has assessed if it is easier now than during the period when the SFS was in place for SMEs to secure loans from financial institutions ; if it has , of the relevant details ; if not , whether such an assessment will be made ; and  
Apart from the distinct improvement in the current account surplus in the second half of 1999 upon the sharp rebound in exports of both goods and services , the turnaround in financial flows back to a net inflow towards the year-end also contributed to the marked rise in BoP surplus in the fourth quarter .  
Hong Kong has long been the international maritime capital of Asia . Not only is its excellent location supported by world-class communications , transport and financial services , but coupled with an enormous pool of experienced professionals in shipping affairs , Hong Kong is the ideal place for settling arbitration disputes .  
Some 15% of the Government expenditure are spent on social welfare , ranging from financial assistance for the needy to a full range of welfare services for the aged , the disabled and other vulnerable groups . 
We have worked hard since then to realise this goal .  This has included drafting and enacting new legislation ; selecting a strong team of financial institutions to prepare , manage and underwrite the Share Offer ; and developing a comprehensive advertising campaign , which starts tomorrow .  You have probably noticed some of the material already ; and we will preview the rest shortly .  
Within the total factor income outflow , DII surged by 91.6% in the first quarter of 2000 over a year earlier .  This reflected a distinct pick-up in earnings from direct investment in Hong Kong , particularly by those engaged in financial business , as the recovery of the local economy became more entrenched .  
The net outflow of financial non-reserve assets in the first quarter of 2000 was characterised by a net outflow in direct investment due to increased investment by Hong Kong residents abroad , a shift to net outflow due to cash settlement of financial derivatives , and a continued though reduced net outflow in other investment , but a continued huge net inflow in portfolio investment .  
Against the continued sizeable surplus in the current account , this reversal in BoP position was mostly due to a switch to net outflow in financial non-reserve assets in the first quarter of this year , having recorded a huge net inflow in the preceding quarter .  
In turn , this was caused by the highly volatile movements in net cash settlement of financial derivatives , together with increase in direct investment abroad upon the improved regional economic environment .  
We are committed to maintaining monetary and banking stability in Hong Kong ; improving the regulatory framework ; and enhancing the infrastructure required for an international financial centre and providing an appropriate environment for an open , fair and efficient market ; and spearheading the further development of the financial markets .  
" Hong Kong is experienced in international capital financing and able to provide a wide variety of financial services .  Our efficient market and monitoring mechanism as well as prudent banking sector can provide effective capital financing services to the western region .  
Hong Kong 's market mechanism is well aligned with the world system .  The regulation of financial businesses such as banking , insurance and securities is efficient .  Professional services such as legal services , accounting and consultancy are well established .  The external networking such as trade , communication and transportation is also properly set up .  
A Government spokesman said : " We are pleased to note JCRA 's recognition of Hong Kong 's strong economic recovery , extensive external reserves and solid fiscal position , high standard in financial market regulation and successful reforms of our financial and monetary regimes . "  
JCRA 's upgrade was based on Hong Kong 's recovery from the economic recession , the extensive external reserves and solid fiscal position that were not impaired by the financial crisis , and the reforms that had strengthened the currency board arrangements and enhanced the Government 's ability to fend off speculative pressure .  
He added that Hong Kong 's strong economic fundamentals were supported by its prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , sound financial regulatory systems and stable economic development of the Mainland .  
Mr Tung said APEC Leaders had resolved to continue working in international forums to help shape the global economy and to provide a more secure and stable financial environment for developed and developing countries .  
He added that Hong Kong 's traditional strengths have contributed to the positive outlook of our e-business development .  These include an excellent business environment , world-renowned physical infrastructure such as the port and the airport , an open market economy , free flow of information , freedom of speech ; the rule of law ; and Hong Kong 's position as a world class international financial centre and Asia 's largest venture capital centre .  
The main objective of the Bill is to set up an effective regulatory regime for the development of a fair , orderly and transparent market to promote market confidence , secure appropriate investor protection , reduce market malpractice and financial crimes , and facilitate innovation and competition .  
The Banking ( Amendment ) Bill 2000 seeks to strengthen the regulatory functions of the MA corresponding to the introduction of the regulatory regime by the SF Bill , to ensure that regulation of the securities business of exempt AIs is carried out in a more effective and fair manner .  This will be conducive to enhancing Hong Kong 's status as an international financial centre .  I hope that Members will support the Bill .  
While the current account continued to record a large surplus upon the export boom and the net inflow of external factor income , the financial non-reserve assets also switched back to a net inflow in the second quarter , mostly due to a substantial inflow of direct investment into Hong Kong but also upon a continued net inflow of portfolio investment fund .  
There are four major reasons underlying the late payment of rates - - new owners have not received rates demands in the immediate period following the change of ownership of premises ; owners fail to make prompt arrangements with tenants for rates payment after the properties have been let ; payers claiming that they have not received rates demands or payers have forgotten to pay rates before the due date ; or payers have been unable to settle the payment due to financial difficulties .  
" We shall ensure that the public fees will always be set at a level that is affordable by individual patients and there will always be a safety net to enable the financial vulnerable to continue to have equal access to quality medical care .  
Because the severely disabled and the elderly infirm were considered to have extra needs , the original objectives of the scheme were to give some financial help to the families concerned and to reduce demand for institutional care for these two groups .  
A Government secretariat spokesman pointed out that Hong Kong 's overall external payments position remained favourable in the third quarter of 2000 , marked by a further increase in the current account surplus and continued net inflow of financial non-reserve assets .  
The committee , if set up , will be responsible for drawing up recommendations on how the existing rent fixing and review mechanism , where the median rent-to-income ratio ( MRIR ) is used as benchmark in assessing tenants ' affordability , may be improved having regard to all relevant legal , financial and policy considerations .  
For the purpose of comparison , the paper focused in particular on the recent financial crisis in Argentina , which , like Hong Kong , operated a currency board system .  The paper noted that the crisis in Argentina was induced more by public finance problems ( such as extensive external debt and a weak fiscal position ) than by any weakness in the monetary system .  
To provide more efficient services to the business community and reinforce Hong Kong 's status as an international financial center , the Companies Registry will implement a Strategic Change Plan ( SCP ) to switch into paperless electronic operation and will be committed to bring forward the reviews on company law and corporate governance .  
( a ) of the respective numbers of organizations which applied to the AIDS Council for funding and whose applications were approved in each of the past five financial years , together with detailed information about the organizations subsidized under the three categories of funding application , namely " ex-gratia payments " , " medical and support services " and " publicity and public education " , including the name of each organization and the amount of funds obtained ; 
He added that HK 's strong economic fundamentals were supported by its prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , sound financial regulatory systems and stable economic development of the Mainland .  
He emphasised that , in achieving the elusive twin goals of financial and monetary stability , mutually reinforcing anchors as well as an enhanced appreciation of the interdependence of policies in the two areas would be required , regardless of the formal institutional division of responsibility .  
Whilst waiting for the research findings , the three sub-committees are now examining specific governance topics in earnest .  Some examples of the subjects being considered include the need for a statutory statement of duties for directors ; shareholder remedies ; standards of corporate disclosure ; and filing of financial statements by private companies .  
The Committee emphasised that interim measures were needed to enable employers , in particular multinational financial corporations , to recruit the employees that meet their corporate needs without having to resort to overseas talent or by moving their operations to alternative centres where suitable human resources were available .  
He added that Hong Kong 's strong economic fundamentals , prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , and sound financial regulatory systems merit higher ratings for Hong Kong .  
" The pre-qualification exercise will ensure that all applicants will meet a minimum standard of investment , network rollout and financial capability while spectrum auction is an allocation process that is efficient , fair and transparent , " he stressed .  
( a ) in order to reduce the operating costs of SMEs , expeditiously and suitably relaxing the restrictions on the use of industrial premises , encouraging further introduction of internationally recognized quality certification services in the market , providing greater financial support in such areas as manpower training , marketing and the application of information technology , encouraging franchised companies to lower their fees and charges and to engage in healthy competition , as well as striving to maintain a simple tax system ;  
Looking ahead , we will concentrate in the new financial year on implementing a programme to provide financial assistance for retrofitting 50,000 pre-Euro heavy diesel vehicles with suitable catalytic converters , mapping out a way forward for replacing diesel light buses with alternative fuel models and drawing up codes of practice in conjunction with the relevant parties on controlling idling engines .  
According to the terms of reference , the committee will review the current domestic rent policy , having regard to the evolving profile of both tenants and rental housing stock under the HA . The committee will take into account the need to reflect tenants ' affordability while ensuring public housing subsidy is given in relation to need , the existing legislative provisions of having a 10% cap on the median rent-to-income ratio ( MRIR ) after rent adjustment , and the financial performance of the Authority 's rental business .  
I am pleased to know that the Government 's initiatives to improve the elderly services are already bearing fruit .  Over the past three years and a half , we have made a good deal of efforts .  The provisions for elderly welfare services will be increased twofold from $ 1.6 billion in the financial year 1997-98 to $ 3.2 billion in the next financial year .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that Hong Kong 's external payments position remained favourable in the fourth quarter of 2000 , characterised by a continued surplus in the current account and a further net inflow of financial non-reserve assets , hence yielding an overall balance of payments surplus .  
This was underpinned by both a further distinct surplus in the current account and a significant net inflow of financial non-reserve assets , amidst the strong performance of Hong Kong 's external trade and the relative robustness of Hong Kong 's stock market in that year .  
The current financial problem faced by the ECAF could be attributed to a number of causes , the most important one being that there have recently been three major common law cases with damages exceeding $ 10 million .  Besides , as a result of a drop in employees ' compensation insurance premium , levy income has decreased in recent years .  
It has also made developing countries more vulnerable to the impact of external economic turmoil and financial crises , as evidenced by the grave impact of the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s on some Asian countries and regions . 
The financial system , in particular the banking system , is the foundation for economic growth , since a crippled financial sector will be unable to intermediate between savings and investments , thereby leading to prolonged liquidity crunch and inefficient allocation of resources . 
This process of change has been accelerated by the economic crisis in 1997 , which has spread to all parts of Asia . In the light of shrinking sources of financing and disposable incomes consequent to the financial turmoil , Asian hospitals are being organized with ingenuity to facilitate delivery of quality clinical service at the lowest possible cost . 
Apart from the ' wired ' network , Hong Kong is also a leading user of wireless technologies : with a 79 per cent mobile phone penetration rate ; over seven million e-money smart cards are in use in financial and transportation transactions ; and coming on stream in the near future are leading-edge technologies such as 3G mobile communications , digital terrestrial TV and next generation Internet applications .  
( 1 ) A listed company is allowed to send to its shareholders and relevant parties a summary financial report in lieu of the full set of financial documents , subject to the prior consent of the parties involved . 
( 4 ) The summary financial report must be derived from the full set of financial documents , and must state clearly how shareholders and relevant parties can obtain a full set of financial documents free of charge , and how they can inform the listed company if they wish to obtain the summary financial report instead of the full set of financial documents in the future .  
Yet the market lost momentum soon after , along with the slides in the US and Tokyo stock markets , the heavy plunge in telecom and technology shares worldwide , and also the setback in financial shares .  The Hang Seng Index fell back to a 17-month low of 12 583 on 23 March , before recovering slightly to stand at 12 761 at end-March 2001 , 15% lower than at end-2000 .  
The annual meeting was attended by over 200 senior officials from central banks , financial regulatory bodies , and legal , financial and law enforcement agencies of member and observer jurisdictions , as well as representatives from international and regional organisations , including the Asian Development Bank , the International Monetary Fund , the United Nations and the World Customs Organization .  
All limited companies incorporated in Hong Kong , including listed companies , are required under the Companies Ordinance to send financial documents that are to be laid before the company at a general meeting to their shareholders , debenture holders and other entitled persons ( " shareholders and relevant persons " ) not less than 21 days before the date of the meeting .  
The main purpose of allowing listed companies to issue summary financial reports is to provide the shareholders and relevant persons with an additional choice and the shareholders ' right of access to full corporate information will not be affected .  
Shareholders and relevant persons may still ask for a full set of financial documents from the company even if they have elected to receive the summary financial report and have received it , subject to the request being made prior to the next general meeting .  The company is required to send out the documents within 14 days upon receipt of the relevant notification .  
I should also point out that under the Bill , a listed company would be considered to have fulfilled its legal requirement of sending a summary financial report if he published the report on its website and notified the shareholders and relevant persons who had agreed with this arrangement of such posting .  
Having a critical mass of articulate and robust practitioners with good analytical ability and alive to both local and international developments would enable Hong Kong to capitalise on the opportunities offered by globalisation and to further our position as an international financial centre .  
" With respect to collaboration between linked primary and secondary schools , the ED recommends that at the initial stage of development , the primary and secondary schools forming ' through-trains ' should still be considered as separate entities in fund allocation and financial arrangements , staff establishment , and school management . "  " They will not be treated as a new type of schools .  
The HKMA 's view is that Hong Kong 's high level of foreign reserves was crucial in enabling Hong Kong to ward off the speculative attacks of 1997 and 1998 and that a strong reserve position remains crucial to the stability and credibility of the Hong Kong dollar in an increasingly globalised and uncertain financial environment .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that Hong Kong 's overall external payments position remained favourable in the first quarter of 2001 , marked by both a continued surplus in the current account and a further considerable net inflow of financial non-reserve assets in the capital and financial account .  
Mr Tung said : " With a strategic location , a level playing field for business , excellent infrastructure , a dense network of financial and professional service firms , and political stability , Hong Kong offers a good operating environment for businesses . "  
Members noted that the risks to financial stability under a fixed exchange system , particularly a currency board system , included the greater exposure to interest rate volatility from speculative inflows and outflows and the possibility that the economic cycles for the linked currency and the reserve currency may not be perfectly synchronised , thus exacerbating economic swings and increasing the scope for unstable dynamics to develop .  
He pointed out that in caring for the elderly , the government was aiming at holistic care which addressed the financial , physical and social needs of Hong Kong 's senior citizens .  
At the Meeting , Ministers acknowledged the importance of helping SMEs enhance technological innovation through co-operation , and sharing of information and resources ; access finance through enhancing SMEs ' financial transparency and identifying new financing channels ; and creating a favourable business environment conducive to starting and developing businesses .  
Mr Leung said : " The global financial system remains under stress , given large external deficit of the US , extended deflation and weak banking system in Japan , significant correction in major equity markets , more volatility and misalignments in exchange rates , and problems in key emerging markets like Argentina and Turkey . "  
" Our strengths in financial services and professional skills - management , accounting , legal services , consulting , marketing and international sourcing , couple with our excellent air , sea and telecommunications infrastructure , underline our role as a leading regional and international hub as the world goes to China , the mother of all emerging markets in the 21st century , " he added .  
" However , we consider that Hong Kong merits a higher rating , in view of our strong economic fundamentals which are supported by prudent fiscal policies , huge foreign exchange reserves , sound financial regulatory systems , and stable economic development of the Mainland , " the spokesman said .  
In 1992 , the Narcotics Bureau of the Hong Kong Police Force commenced financial investigation into the affairs of Bruce Michael McCauley , who was sentenced to imprisonment in 1994 after pleading guilty to the charge of possession of not less than a commercial quantity of heroin , which was reasonably suspected of being imported into Australia . McCauley was alleged to have set up offshore companies , some of which were disclosed by an accounting firm in Hong Kong , for laundering drug proceeds .  
Following complex , protracted investigations into two separate global drug trafficking syndicates , the hard work and co-operation established between representatives of each agency involved finally bore fruit with the confiscation of drug trafficking assets totalling over HK $ 83 million from Hong Kong financial institutions .  
The challenges are tough , but we have great strengths : a sound and solid institutional framework , sophisticated and world class infrastructure underpinning our position as an international financial , trading , shipping , logistics and tourism centre , and a large pool of talents experienced in doing business in overseas markets and conversant with the Mainland developments . 
We have a robust legal system , a level playing field , a stringent market regulatory system , a liberal foreign exchange regime , the free flow of information , a clean government , a sound financial position and a simple taxation system .  
Mrs Lo said terrorists and the organisations they supported had proved to be all too adept at moving money , evading rules , breaking laws and slipping through the existing security cordons of the international financial system .  
He explained , " The prolonged economic downturn is making it difficult for some domestic property owners to continue with their monthly mortgage payments .  Some are even forced to sell their properties and move to less satisfactory private housing . "  " And rather than financial gains , the majority of transactions of private domestic property recorded recently have indicated losses to the vendors . "  
That is , first , a publicly administered , privately managed mandatory provident fund which is employment-related ; second , private savings , investments and annuities ; and third , a publicly managed scheme to provide minimum protection , such as a social safety net to provide needy elders with financial assistance to meet their basic needs .  
Our objective is to develop an adequate but sustainable social safety net that provides financial assistance to our needy elders to meet their basic needs .  
( a ) The Linked Exchange Rate provides a stable , predictable and well understood monetary system that is well suited to Hong Kong 's highly external and flexible economy and to its position as an international financial centre .  
Director of BJO , Mr Bowen Leung , stressed at a press conference held today ( November 13 ) in Chongqing that he hoped that these activities will help foster better understanding between the two cities , increase the participation of small and medium enterprises as well as financial and professional services in the economic development of Chongqing , and start all-round cooperation between the two cities .  
Mr Cross emphasised that money laundering posed a direct threat to national and international financial systems .  The issue of bank secrecy required to be examined in light of the need to balance the interests of the individual , the financial services provider and the state .  
Speaking at the Hong Kong Business Seminar in Osaka , Miss Cheung said Hong Kong 's unique advantages for Japanese businesses intending to make their inroads into the huge China market included its financial and legal services , port and airport facilities , high quality professionals with excellent knowledge of doing business in China and their extensive network of contacts .  
Analysed by economic sector , the average monthly salaries of middle-level managerial and professional employees in transport , storage and communications and in financial institutions and insurance registered increases of 3.5% and 2.9% respectively in nominal terms , or 4.8% and 4.2% respectively in real terms .  
Its good legal , exchange rate , taxation and regulatory environments , coupled with its excellent professional services , have made it especially well suited for regional headquarters and regional offices .  In addition , Hong Kong will remain firm in its position as a financial centre .  
This will create huge room for development for Hong Kong 's enterprises .  With our many unique advantages , such as the rule of law , a low tax rate , a clean government , a solid financial system , the free flow of capital and information , and a wealth of knowledge about the Mainland and international markets , Hong Kong will be able to contribute to the further development of the Mainland and , in the process , find new impetus of growth for our own economy .  
He added : " Over the past years , we have accumulated extensive experience on business dealings with the Mainland . These hard earned advantages , together with our sound legal system , our advanced telecommunications and other infrastructure facilities , our small and efficient government , and our strength as an international financial centre with a freely convertible currency , should enable Hong Kong companies to secure a significant share of the liberalised trade following China 's WTO accession . "  
Against the backdrop of worsening economic conditions worldwide , Argentina 's public debt problem had developed into a major financial crisis , the impact of which had created some slight volatility in the Hong Kong dollar 12-month forward market around the middle of October .  
Then the 911 incident aroused widespread anxieties in the global financial markets , causing the Hang Seng Index to plummet to a near three-year low of 8 934 on 21 September , 14% down from the pre-911 closing level .  
However , in very exceptional circumstances , the department will exercise discretion given by law and consider not imposing surcharge .  For instance , a taxpayer has successfully applied for holdover of a part or the whole of provisional salaries tax payable on the ground that he is unemployed .  However , due to severe financial problem consequent upon unemployment , the taxpayer still can not afford to settle the balance of tax payable but has showed sincerity in agreeing to an acceptable instalment plan with the department .  
Looking ahead , we will further develop the depth and width of our bond market .  We are forging the bilateral linkage with Euroclear with a view to promoting cross-boundary custody and clearing of Hong Kong and overseas bonds , and at the same time expanding the base of investors , thereby stimulating the growth of both local and regional bond markets .  We will also develop our CMU into an international clearing house , so that Hong Kong will become the central clearing house in Asia . This will strengthen our status as an international financial centre .  
Ideally , the minimum relevant income level should be set at a level high enough to exclude those employees in the lower income bands from contributing so as to alleviate their financial hardship during times when economic conditions are poor .  This level , on the other hand , should not be too high as to drastically reduce in the long run the amount of accrued benefits for retirement .  
The contest received an encouraging response with over 4,700 entries .  The standard of the contestants are very promising , especially our champion who let her imagination fly free and creatively highlighted the uniqueness of Hong Kong as an international business and financial centre , a cosmopolitan and vibrant city and the gateway to China in her design .  
In view of the prevailing market conditions and to allow the market greater flexibility , we have put the larger , more valuable sites in the current financial year 's Application List and have arranged for the smaller private housing sites to be sold in the scheduled land auctions .  
" As to poor families in public housing , the Government has put in place all the elements of a comprehensive safety net .  Firstly , the CSSA scheme run by the Social Welfare Department covers the entire rent for the poorest households .  Secondly , the HA 's Rent Assistance Scheme cuts by half the rentals paid by families whose financial positions suddenly deteriorate .  Households may also move to flats at lower rents or switch to interim housing to get out of the plight .  
Addressing over 200 prominent guests at a business reception in Nagasaki , Miss Cheung said these advantages included Hong Kong 's financial and legal services , port and airport facilities , high quality professionals with excellent knowledge of doing business in China and their extensive network of contacts . 
" However , serious disciplinary action would be taken against those who have become indebted due to gambling or other reprehensible causes ; who have borrowed money from illegitimate or unauthorised sources or who have had unmanageable debts due to financial imprudence , resulting in the impairment of the officer 's operational efficiency .  
First , I forecast a consolidated deficit of $ 65.6 billion for 2001-02 ( equivalent to 5.2% of GDP ) , far larger than the original estimate of $ 3 billion .  This is due mainly to revenue from land premiums and investment income from our fiscal reserves falling far short of our original forecasts .  Furthermore , the secondary offering of Mass Transit Railway shares originally planned for this financial year has been postponed to the next because of changes in investment market conditions .  
First , I forecast a consolidated deficit of $ 65.6 billion for 2001-02 ( equivalent to 5.2% of GDP ) , far larger than the original estimate of $ 3 billion .  This is due mainly to revenue from land premiums and investment income from our fiscal reserves falling far short of our original forecasts .  Furthermore , the secondary offering of Mass Transit Railway shares originally planned for this financial year has been postponed to the next because of changes in investment market conditions .  
The implementation of the new legislation to set up a sound regulatory framework for the financial market can help enhance the quality of the local market by making it in line with international standards and attractive to local and overseas investors . 
In the capital and financial account , despite the austere economic environment worldwide , there was still a substantial injection of equity capital into the local economy in the fourth quarter , leading to a further net direct investment inflow .  
By the end of this financial year , the actual expenditure on the capital works programme is expected to be about $ 24.8 billion .  This slightly exceeds our original target of $ 24.5 billion as a result of the satisfactory progress of a number of major projects .  
The FATF Forty Recommendations , first developed in 1990 and subsequently revised in 1996 , provide a complete set of counter-measures against money laundering covering the judicial system and law enforcement , the financial system and its regulation , and international cooperation . 
Directors emphasized that the smooth functioning of the link will continue to depend critically on prudent fiscal policies , flexible goods and factor markets , a robust financial system , and large foreign reserves .  
Speaking on the theme " The Asian Crisis : Lessons for the Future " , Dr Fischer focused on four major economic issues , each of which had generated considerate debate during and after the Asian Crisis . They were ( i ) fiscal policy in good and bad times ; ( ii ) financial systems and corporate governance ; ( iii ) exchange rate systems ; and ( iv ) potential regional economic arrangements for Asia .  
CNBC , the foremost global provider of business and financial information and TNT , the world 's leading business logistics solutions company , today ( May 23 ) announced the launch of the Asia Business Leader Awards 2002 , the prestigious annual honour that recognises achievement , innovation and leadership in regional business .  
The FATF Forty Recommendations , first developed in 1990 and subsequently revised in 1996 , are intended to cover all aspects of a national anti-money laundering system , including the criminal justice system and law enforcement , the financial system and its regulation , and international cooperation .  
" Hong Kong provides an independent judicial system based on English common law , a solid and transparent regulatory framework , a large and varied pool of qualified financial professionals , as well as free flow of capital and information .  These competitive edges make Hong Kong the most ideal place for business development for international investment banks and securities houses in the Greater China region , " said Mr Rowse .  
These factors included political stability and security , rule of law and an independent judiciary , corruption free government , infrastructure , press and information freedom , a sturdy banking and financial system and a low and simple tax regime .  
With the strong support of the Central Government and the joint efforts of Hong Kong people , we have successfully implemented " One Country , Two Systems " .  We have overcome the Asian financial crisis .  We have preserved social order , ensuring that Hong Kong maintains a politically and socially stable environment and a solid economic foundation that can rise to any challenges ahead .  
As an externally oriented economy , Hong Kong is well poised as China 's ' Window to the World ' to service this transformation of stupendous proportions as we continue to capitalize on our excellent financial , logistics , legal , accounting , management , marketing and other professional expertise as well as our international connections .  
Ms Leung said that with its sophisticated telecommunications network , favourable geographical location , sound financial system , free capital flow and transparent investment environment , Hong Kong has developed into a major international financial centre and made many achievements .  
Under the existing regulatory framework , domestic free television programme service licensees should comply with relevant statutory requirements , licence conditions as well as codes of practice .  They should also make financial and investment commitments in order to maintain an adequate and comprehensive service .  
Mr Tang said , " To cater for the existing smaller local insurers , certain requirements will be relaxed or exempted if their annual gross premium income for the immediate preceding financial year , and gross insurance liabilities at the end of the immediate preceding financial year both fall below HK $ 20 million . "  
" After closing of the current prequalification exercise , we will prequalify no more than five candidates to participate in the forthcoming ' design and build ' contract tender exercise based on their technical , managerial and financial capability to fulfill the contract as well as design capability . " 
" We appreciate the effort of the operating agencies , including non-government organisations and private operators , for taking initiative to freeze or reduce their fee charges .  Their act has demonstrated their commitment in running quality service while at the same time sharing jointly parents ' financial burden under this stagnant economic environment , " the spokesman said .  
Our economic and social institutions remain unchanged .  Our position as an international centre for trade and business , financial services and shipping industry has been maintained .  Hong Kong is recognised as one of the most dynamic cities in Asia and in the world .  
" We note JCRA 's recognition that Hong Kong enjoys strong external position , high level of fiscal flexibility , a resilient financial sector and a high level of autonomy in many aspects , including the financial and legal systems , and that HK 's role as an international financial centre has remained intact , " a Government spokesman said .  
The meeting , to be held on September 5 and 6 , will focus on ways to strengthen global economic growth , combating terrorist financing and money laundering , advancing fiscal and financial reforms , and improving the allocation of domestic savings for economic development .  
Despite the financial crisis which forced Asian governments and businesses to strengthen their systems and to re-climb the ladder to growth , Mr Leung said no Asian country was more robust than China with a continuing economic growth consistently at seven to eight per cent a year , a stable currency , a booming manufacturing base and a blossoming domestic market . 
Arriving in Toronto late last night , Mr Leung started his whirlwind visit program this morning with a roundtable discussion with economists of major Canadian banks to provide an update on the successful implementation of " One Country , Two Systems " in Hong Kong . He also briefed them how Hong Kong has risen up to the challenges and opportunities arising from economic restructuring and economic integration with the Mainland of China , and continued to be a thriving international financial and business centre in the region . 
" Due to our ageing population , rapid technological advances and increasing community aspiration , our public health care system is suffering from an intensive financial pressure as the cost to maintain it has been increasing swiftly and there is concern on whether the system 's long-term financial sustainability can be maintained . 
It has been reported that in a crackdown on a loan-shark syndicate early last month , the Police discovered that half of the debtors were owners of small and medium enterprises ( " SMEs " ) .  These debtors resorted to borrowing from the loan-shark syndicate at an annual interest rate as high as 400% to deal with their cash flow problems because they were not able to secure loans from authorized financial institutions .  
Indeed , we will strengthen our competitive advantages as an international financial centre , a key transport and logistic hub , a vibrant economic and trading centre as well as a popular tourism destination .  
In order to ensure our separate way of life , our legal , financial and other systems remained unchanged after reunification , it was written into the Basic Law that it would be left to us , the people of Hong Kong , to draw up our own laws to safeguard national security , sovereignty , territorial integrity and unity .  
Regarding the details of the proposal , Mr Lam said in respect of GC and FC elections , the candidates who got elected or had received 5 % of valid votes or more would be given financial support .  The rate would be set at $ 10 per vote but capped at 50% of the actual declared election expenses of the candidate concerned .  
The current deficit is serious and is threatening to undermine our financial strength and market confidence .  If the problem is not solved as soon as possible , Hong Kong risks being exposed to heightened speculation , which may trigger outflows of capital , rising interest rates , turmoil in the financial markets leading ultimately to possible attacks on our linked exchange rate system .  
Four years from now , we expect the Mainland to have become more fully aligned with the rest of the world in trade and economic matters .  We must seize these opportunities to elevate Hong Kong from its traditional role as an intermediary to a major hub connecting the Mainland and the international markets .  We can do this by supporting the Mainland 's economic development and opening up of its economy .  At the same time , we will enhance our position as the financial and commercial centre of China .  
Leaders of the Central Government and Guangdong Province as well as the Chief Executive of Macau fully support the development of the PRD , including Macau , into a major modernised economic region through enhancing co-operation with Hong Kong . The region will be a production and manufacturing base , a centre of modern services such as logistics , professional and financial services , tourism and entertainment , communication as well as consumer and personal services . 
These will include raising and speeding up the level of co-operation to realise our common goal of achieving a major modernised economic region , enhancing our co-ordination in regional infrastructure projects , strengthening our world-class logistics services , developing the western part of the PRD , and fully expanding our services industries .  There is scope to explore new areas of co-operation in the financial sector , in improving market regulation and in education .  
We still have the hardware and software required of a world-class city , including our keen business acumen , a well-developed infrastructure , a versatile financial system , robust legal institutions , policies conducive to a free and open society , a clean and efficient civil service , simple and low taxation , a large pool of talent and a cosmopolitan community .  
It will not only be a manufacturing base with new technology inputs , but also a principal provider of modern services to China and the Asia-Pacific . It will host clusters of internationally competitive enterprises , engaging in logistics , professional and financial services , tourism and entertainment , communication , consumer and personal services , in addition to other high-value added activities .  
A local organisation will be considered as subordinate to a Mainland organisation only if the former accepts substantial financial contributions from , is directed or controlled by , or has its policies determined by , a Mainland organisation .  
It has a world-class financial and banking system with a large and varied pool of qualified financial professionals , a simple and low tax regime , an independent judiciary based on English common law , a solid and transparent regulatory framework , as well as free flow of capital and information . "  
We also encourage SMEs to participate in Government tenders by enhancing the provision of information about our IT projects to the market and by reducing the financial burden on potential tenderers ( for example , lowering or removing the tender and contract deposit requirement , and only requiring a performance bond or bank guarantee from a successful tenderer for high-value or complex project contracts if , during financial vetting , the tenderer is unable to supply adequate supporting information about its financial capability to perform its contractual obligations ) .  
Specifically , we will review our social security schemes to ensure a basic safety net for needy elders and people with disabilities , assist the unemployed and the needy to tide over their short term financial difficulties , adopt more vigorous and rational gate-keeping for access to services based on defined need , and re-engineer services to strengthen integration and networking .  
As the number of families and individuals requiring financial support by the Government is bound to increase given the current economic situation and high unemployment , the adjustment will enable us to ensure that the safety net can be maintained within our means and that existing resources go further to meet the increasing demand . 
It is essential for us to look far ahead to find feasible and practical ways to develop a sustainable financial support system for the needy elderly .  
We believe that a more effective way to address the problem of deflation without increasing our financial burden is to increase external demand , which means attracting more visitors , overseas talent and investment immigrants to come to Hong Kong ; more foreign enterprises to set up regional offices here ; more people to attend schools in Hong Kong and seek medical treatment at our private hospitals ; and more foreign capital inflows into Hong Kong 's financial market .  
At present , the Social Welfare Department ( SWD ) provides residential services for people with disabilities and the elderly primarily through financial subventions to non-governmental organisations ( NGOs ) .  Amongst these residential services , Long Stay Care Homes are for mentally ill patients with long-term residual disabilities whilst Hostels for Mentally Handicapped Persons are for people with varying degrees of mental handicap .  Residential services for elders suffering from poor health or physical / mental weaknesses are provided in Care and Attention Homes ( including those for the Aged Blind ) and Nursing Homes .  
Within the total factor income outflow , DII outflow rose by 8.6% in the fourth quarter of 2002 over a year earlier , largely owing to increased earnings from investment in the local financial sector by some prominent multinational enterprises .  
We will introduce legislative amendments in the middle of this year to require installation of particulate traps and catalytic converters on all pre-Euro light diesel vehicles .  The same statutory requirements will be imposed on all pre-Euro heavy diesel vehicles upon completion of the current programme to provide financial assistance for retrofitting of catalytic converters next year .  
In conclusion , despite the financial stringency faced by the Government and the Housing Authority , I am confident that we can make use of our limited resources to implement the three main pillars of our housing policy , namely , helping low-income families gain access to affordable housing , minimising intervention in the market and maintaining a fair and stable operating environment for the healthy development of the private property market .  
Financial Secretary : We noted that the rating agency had adjusted the outlook of Hong Kong . The Government is fully aware of the impact of the atypical pneumonia on Hong Kong and on our economy .  That 's why the Government has assigned top priority in controlling and containing the spread of the disease .  And we spare no efforts , including financial , personnel and other resources , in making sure that the disease is controlled .  
( b ) the names of the events which the IEF has supported so far , the amounts and types of financial support given to these events , and the names of their organizers ; among such events , those which were not held as scheduled and the reasons for that , as well as the events the organizers of which failed to meet their contractual obligations to repay the loans provided by the IEF and the outstanding amounts involved ; and  
While the differential treatment for child allowance between the first two children and the third to ninth child is unlikely to have a significant impact on the decision of a couple regarding the size of their family , the differential may not be appropriate in the light of our very low fertility rate and has been removed as from the current financial year . 
In commercial operation , there is also application of grid computing where intensive computing or massive data analysis is required , for example , in using random state simulation to analyse complicated financial environment , optimising product design , and pharmaceutical research and production .  
We have the hardware and software required of a world-class city , including our keen business acumen , a well-developed infrastructure , a versatile financial system , robust legal institutions , policies conducive to a free and open society , a clean and efficient civil service , simple and low taxation , a large pool of talent and a very cosmopolitan community .

Under the scheme , financial assistance for each approved application is worked out according to a formula having regard to the age and normal retirement age of the deceased and the prevailing median monthly employment earnings , with minimum and maximum levels at $ 3 million and $ 6 million respectively at present .  
( a ) whether the authorities have , over the past three financial years , objected to applications from these owners to the Town Planning Board for land development or change in land use for development or rejected applications from indigenous residents of the New Territories for building small houses on private land , on the ground that the land concerned is reserved for infrastructure or housing projects ; if so , of the details of the relevant policies in this regard and the respective numbers of applications objected to or rejected over the above period ; and  
We have the hardware and the software required of a world-class city , including our keen business acumen , a well-developed infrastructure , a versatile financial system , robust legal institutions , free and open society , a clean and efficient civil service , simple and low taxation , a large pool of talent and a cosmopolitan community . 
Addressing some 100 guests at a reception hosted by the Swiss Chinese Chamber of Commerce , Mr Ma outlined Hong Kong 's fundamental strengths and efforts in maintaining its status as an international financial centre and the premier capital formation centre of the Mainland , the enhanced attractiveness to foreign investors following the signing of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangements , and the efforts and achievements in the financial services sector including the encouraging development of the Hong Kong bond market .  
The Government today ( August 8 ) has approved an application for financial assistance by the family members of a private doctor who died of severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) contracted in the course of his professional practice .  
The amount of financial assistance for each approved application is worked out according to a formula having regard to the age and normal retirement age of the deceased and the prevailing median monthly employment earnings , with minimum and maximum levels at $ 3 million and $ 6 million respectively at present .  
" As the world 's freest economy and a vibrant and sophisticated international financial and business centre , Hong Kong 's strategic location and international networks , as well as experience and expertise in dealing with foreign and China business make us the preferred destination for international companies to set up their regional offices and regional headquarters . "  
Since terrorists deploy ' reverse money laundering ' techniques , by using money obtained legally for illegal acts , and launder small amounts of ' clean money ' so it can be used for ' dirty ends ' , it is obvious that traditional methods to track down funds are no longer adequate , and that heightened vigilance by financial institutions is vital .  
Mr Passow continued , " The criteria for all awards was based on conversations by the editorial staff with consultants from the major accounting and financial service firms who monitor direct international investment flows and the tracking by Euromoney 's editorial staff of public information on the dollar amounts of deals in the Asia Pacific area .  
In the advancement of regional synergy , Hong Kong , as an international financial centre and world city , will play an essential role in raising capital , pooling talent and developing market mechanisms and global networks for the PRD .  
The much dwindled current account surplus was unable to offset the net outflow of funds in the financial and capital account , which was mainly led by a sharp reversal from net inflow to net outflow in the banking sector as net other investment outflow , outrunning the strong surge in net direct investment inflow and the significantly moderated net portfolio investment outflow .  
At a joint meeting of Legislative Council 's Panel on Planning , Lands and Works and Panel on Environmental Affairs this ( October 13 ) afternoon , some members expressed that the Government and its legal representatives had led the court to believe that reclamation was not irreversible and the Government would suffer huge financial losses if the court ordered the work be stopped pending the outcome of a judicial review .  
In June this year , the Government published in the Gazette the list of firms for the provision of financial consultancy services to bureaux / departments ( the list ) , and set out at the same time the two criteria used for selection of firms to be included in the list : ( i ) the business of the firm is to provide financial consultancy services ; and ( ii ) the firm must be a registered company in Hong Kong or possess a valid Hong Kong business registration certificate .  
( b ) patients recovered from SARS who suffer from longer term effects , attributable to SARS , which may result in some degree of physical or psychological dysfunction , subject to medical proof and demonstrated financial need .  
( 2 ) special ex-gratia financial assistance for recovered SARS patients suffering from longer-term effects , attributable to SARS or arising from the treatment received for SARS , which might result in some degree of physical or psychological dysfunction .  
The participants were divided into eight panel groups to discuss specific topics in their specialized field , education and culture , business and industry , financial and monetary affairs communications reconstruction , agricultural reconstruction , social welfare , public health and urban development .  
The venture capitalist on the other hand is always looking for new opportunities and will be willing to part with a company that is standing on it 's own financial feet . To sell interest in a commercial concern takes an organized market , Taiwan is also in the process of developing a reliable and stable stock market to reach this end .  
A : The Executive Yuan has always seen the improvement of military , public servant , and teacher salaries as an issue of importance , and adjustment will be made in fiscal 1988 . The rate of adjustment will be matched by the Executive Yuan with the total calculated budget for fiscal 1988 . These adjustments must take into account the factors of price fluctuations , financial liability capabilities , and the general salary levels of the people . They have no relation whatsoever to the level of foreign exchange reserves .  
Likewise , if its performance is poor , the price of its stock will fall . However , in the past , except for a few " major accounts " and institutional investors , most market players were housewives or retirees lacking financial expertise who engaged in short-term speculation relying on word of mouth rather than long-term investment based on a company 's performance .  
Wang served with Yin Chung-jung , K . T . Li , Chao Yao-tung , and other famous leading figures in the world of economics and finance . He can rely on a rich background and thirty years ' training at mediating views to handle the coordination and communications among the various economic and financial ministries . This will enable Premier Lee to focus on mapping out the nation 's political and economic future .  
Thereafter , enticed by financial inducements or simply duped into going , millions of coolies accepted a modest payment and contracted to work for a limited period in tin mines or in the rubber , tea and sugar plantations of Southeast Asia . Others set off further afield to dig for guano in Peru , build railways in America , work in the gold mines of Australia and South Africa , or work behind the lines on the Great War battlefields of Europe .  
In order to ensure normal economic growth and release inflationary pressure , the Central Bank decided to adopt a policy of financial stringency as from March of this year and the money supply growth rate has steadily fallen from its original 30% ; another factor which caused there to be less cash in circulation in Taiwan was purchases of foreign currency by many people who anticipated that the NT dollar would depreciate .  
Failure to repay money borrowed from colleague and relatives is ruinous to personal relationships , and people have gone to ground to avoid their debts . Those with more savvy have managed to shift their own losses onto their firm , while others have been lucky in that their firm has accepted responsibility for their own debt - - securities firms are keen to maintain an immaculate record to qualify under the Ministry of Finance 's recent arrangements for the financial investment and securities industry .  
Koo Chen-fu , who has long been known as an " ambassador of trade " holds a similar view : " The main global economic organizations that we 're fighting to join at present now are GATT , which regulates the world 's free trading system ; the International Monetary Fund , which regulates the world 's financial system ; the World Bank , which assists in the development of developing countries ; and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , which is made up of the world 's leading industrialized countries . "  
" In fact the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar and high foreign exchange reserves are not directly or necessarily linked with speculative fever or inflation . What is important is looking at how policy in the financial markets is carried out and supporting their stability , " says Lu Fang-ching , deputyexecutive secretary of the Commodity Price Supervisory Board at the Ministry of Economic Affairs examining the problem from another angle . " The point is that the central bank , compared to five years ago , is more experienced and very cautious . "  
Insufficient financial and human resources are the reason why handicapped athletics has never been popularized in this country , " says Ho Mao-sung . The CPAA was established seven years ago , but it only has made annual expenditures of NT $ 100,000 ( NT $ 200,000 this year ) , and the amount its volunteer director , secretary-general , and assistant secretary-general are able to accomplish is limited .  
The department found in 1990 that the rate of women aged 15 to 49 who lived with their parents or their husband 's parents within five years of being married increased 4.5 percent over 1988 . And the younger the woman and the lower her level of education ( meaning women with more financial difficulties ) , the more likely she was to live with one set of parents .  
From another point of view , of course these services may be satisfactory for a time . But in the so-called advanced countries , including Britain , the US , Japan , and Australia , because the governments , banks , businesses , and individuals have all been encouraging each other to expand credit ( loan volume ) and have been consuming intensively , this has led to an exhaustion of financial capacity . The defects which were revealed in the current period of economic recession can not but make one sit up and take warning .  
Moreover , Hong Kong has become an international free port in the last twenty years and a financial center . Apart from its explosion of wealth , it has also been very hard to resist the temptations of the flow of imported luxuries from all over the world . Thus , generally speaking , most Hong Kong people like to boast about what they love to enjoy ; enjoyment ( usually material ) has become a very important social value .  
It is said that when some companies have formed alliances with foreign enterprises , even the plans produced by the partners have been so hard to get to grips with that the contract documents are just left to drafted by the opposite parties before they are signed . The result is that , if later on it is discovered that the technological exchange or financial conditions have not been met as planned , then it is too late to escape .  
The KMT 's election broadcasts featured replays of old newsreels showing the DPP 's past street demonstrations and laid the charge against them of engaging in riotous politics . The DPP raised the KMT 's financial scandals to criticize them on counts of corruption and senility . The China Social Democratic Party 's 9-minute broadcast on the theme of growing up accused both parties of pointless fighting and asked where the people are who are going to plant seeds when " the robbers have all got their places . "  
He saw that Taiwan might be an excellent market , so he brought along masters of all of a funeral 's " affiliated industries , " including monks , Taoist priests , carpenters and wood carvers , painters , and makers of incense and of symbolic gold and silver paper money . He gave each of them a substantial payment to insure financial security for their families , and then - - more than 100 strong - - they imposingly crossed the sea to Taiwan to open a new world .  
As well as this , in recent years Taiwan 's financial strength has grown and the New Taiwan Dollar has appreciated significantly . This has led the ITRI to begin introducing technology from abroad , becoming a technological bridge between foreign high technology and domestic businesses and shortening the length of time spent on research and development .  
Recalling that time when he was first struck by computerized printing , Lee seems a bit hesitant and unenthusiastic . " Everybody just cursed . " Still , in a panic that they might lose their jobs , as well as with various incentives like a newspaper sponsored computer entry competition and financial awards to encourage them , and relying on a unrelenting spirit , the vast majority gradually got familiar with the computer keyboard and learned the new typesetting technology .  
In recent years , land speculation , a dramatic rise in the price of housing , stock speculation , and a string of scandals involving major public works pro-jects and purchasing have sullied the R . O . C . ' s political and economic environment . Political factions and financial consortiums have pushed their interests close to the center of power in the ruling party . These have laid the seeds of the people 's discontent . Everywhere one sees petitions for reform .  
The end of Autumn Chrysanthemum is a happy scene of great coming together amidst the conflict between different ethnic groups . The children from the military dependents villages used the fraternal method of financial gifts and peace mediation ( in Wu Chin-fa 's eyes , the children from the military dependents villages had the most resources in those years ) , to smooth over the conflicts between Fukienese-Taiwanese and Hakka-Taiwanese factions , and resolve a scene of bloody conflict .  
Thailand 's Prince Bhisatej once publicly explained at an international agricultural conference that the agricultural assistance from every country was limited to either financial aid or the appointment of chosen specialists to draft a research report . Only the Republic of China 's specialists came in person to northern Thailand to help the Thais grow vegetables and fruit . This proved to be of enormous benefit to the daily lives of the local inhabitants of this district .  
Right now the mainland economy is heated up , and the financial market has the jitters . Of course private companies ca n't compete with state-owned enterprises which have access to deep and extensive human relations networks , " Yang Donghong observes . If a state-owned establishment defaults on a loan , the loan officer holds little responsibility . But if a private business goes insolvent , the officer who sponsored the loan will almost certainly be unable to escape blame .  
What 's more , in 1993 a private financial consortium built the nearby Shin Kong Life Tower , a 53-story skyscraper that has already become a new symbol of the city . And the new 12-story KMT party headquarters is to be located by the East Gate directly across from the Presidential Palace . The Po Ai District is gradually being enclosed amid a concrete jungle of modern skyscrapers .  
When the various conflicts surrounding the health insurance system became a hot topic of discussion , most people probably overlooked one basic fact : The universal health care plan is actually only a financial design , and its goal is to eliminate " loss and waste " from the vast health care system . As for actual medical service , one still must look to the same health care network of medical centers and personnel that is already in place .  
After the universal health insurance was implemented , the medical referral system , buttressed by ample financial power , went into an experimental phase . But wave after wave of strong suspicion and opposition have been thrown up against the program . This has forced the NHIB to initiate the " transitional step " of simplifying the referral system from having four levels to only two , and doing away with extra fees for those who have no referral slips , until the population can become accustomed to the referral system .  
Whether they be from the financial sector or political parties , or are veteran broadcasters or members of the arts starting up their own private operations , the vast majority are interested in stations broadcasting to urban areas with a relatively wide range of listeners and high impact .  
But later his father suffered a stroke , and the family faced a difficult financial situation . The burden of supporting the household fell entirely on Chou Meng-te 's shoulders , and he had no choice but to leave his undemanding teaching job with its regular salary and find another way to earn a living .  
Because of administrative financial difficulties , their environmental conservation budget is limited . Many wildlife conservation activities are even limited to private lands . This has led to a reaction , in which many voices have arisen claiming that more human energy and material should be focused on protecting entire ecosystems and habitats .  
" The best situation would of course be cross-strait reconciliation , so that Taiwan could enter the middle phase of its national unification plan , and establish trade , transport and financial links on the basis of equal and friendly relations , " says C . J . Lee . At that point Taiwanese firms could base decisions as to whether to set up a center of operations directly in , say , Shanghai , or to go through Hong Kong , purely on commercial considerations , and would not have to shoulder an additional political burden .  
Finding foreign partners for joint ventures is not difficult for medium to large-sized companies with substantial financial and technological resources , but " most Taiwanese medium or small businesses have few opportunities to find foreign partners except by becoming satellite companies of Japanese firms , " says Kenneth Lai .  
The Lausanne competitiveness assessment is divided into eight evaluations , covering 225 separate items . Taiwan performed least satisfactorily in terms of financial capability , degree of internationalization , and basic infrastructure . Taiwan finished 35th or lower in a number of specific items - - openness of capital markets , modernization of financial laws and regulations , internal trade , national protectionism , and immigration law .  
In other words , even though the production base moves overseas , the " headquarters " and " logistical support center " remain in Taiwan . Operations items stay in Taiwan , along with capital sourcing , legal , tax , and financial planning , and training of internationalized personnel . All these could service the production bases located in surrounding countries .  
Informed opinion was generally positive about the overall outcome of the 22nd meeting , and in particular about Lee Yuan-tseh 's criticism of the disorder in local politics , society , and the economy . He pointed his finger directly at the struggles for power recently making political news , and at the media 's unabashed scandal-mongering and speculation . For these scholars , who besides doing their research must struggle for administrative and financial resources , the situation has been disappointing and annoying .  
Of late , members of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly , the highest publicly elected body at the provincial level , have been embroiled in numerous scandals involving election bribery , libel charges , financial disputes and various lawsuits . In an effort to clean itself up and drive out malevolent forces , the Assembly conducted a prayer session in honor of the " good brothers , " thereby resorting to ghosts instead of turning to the common people .  
Those who oppose it say " there is no room for public stations . " It is hard to guarantee that any TV station funded by the government will not become the government 's mouthpiece . After it starts broadcasting , the annual cost of NT $ 2.4 billion might very well become a financial burden on the government , not to mention that , being surrounded by dozens of highly competitive channels , PTV will have a hard time surviving .  
When ball games become staged , players are victims too . While pro baseball players may have better financial prospects than other ROC athletes , the golden years of their prime last only about a decade , and many find the chance to earn some extra money in their youth hard to pass up . They make easy prey for the underworld , which brings with it violence , threats and bribery . Once having started down that slippery slope , it 's hard to turn back .  
Six months later , however , the relationship is back in trouble and the couple eventually break up . There are also instances where one person , knowing that the relationship can not be rescued , commits suicide in order to punish their partner with a lifetime of guilt . In one case , a bright and talented financial analyst at a securities firm , despairing over the collapse of her marriage , killed herself and her two little children with doses of hydrochloric acid .  
Were all government funds to reach this level , that would mean nearly another NT $ 100 billion entering the market , which would undoubtedly provide a huge boost . Besides an influx of capital from Taiwan , in recent years , thanks to the policy goal of " financial internationalization , " Taiwan 's stock market has been opened wide to foreign investors . Given the current wave of incoming investment , foreign money has pushed the tide even higher .  
Looking at the past , the last wave of stock fever-with its tidal wave cresting past the 10,000 mark , then falling with devastating force-ended up in a massive redistribution of wealth in Taiwan . When the market is unhealthy , it can be manipulated , and naturally the rich ended up richer and the poor , poorer . Moreover , the huge financial losses of the last cycle disrupted countless families and bankrupted many businesses .  
Since the market is now up , and many provincial assemblymen who had previously opposed the plan have changed their attitudes as a result of the proposal to freeze the provincial government 's functions , the plan is moving forward again . It 's just that the sudden influx of stock will be a blow to share prices of existing stocks , and it will be hard to return financial stocks to their former level of hundreds of dollars per share .  
The company was to be headed by Rojas , the stock to be floated on the Mexican market . The Mexican City market was to be its base , chiefly responsible for financial and legal services . Miami was to be the operational and transport hub , responsible for sales , technical assistance , product planning , dispersal , warehousing , and so on .  
Ordinary families in which the husband 's and wife 's combined monthly income is only NT $ 80-90,000 not only need to meet their mortgage payments , cover their childcare fees and pay for three meals a day ; like Kuafu chasing the sun they should also be assiduously pursuing one financial goal after another , each higher than the last . ( In Chinese legend , the overambitious Kuafu chased the sun , and after catching up with it died of thirst despite drinking dry two rivers and a marsh ) .  
With technological advance and the rise of the modern financial system , the financial network built up on computer networks by corporate entities such as banks , investment trusts and multinational companies is so closely interlinked that any movement affects the whole system . This network not only extends to all countries within the region , it also links stock exchanges , forex markets , bonds , futures and even real estate and other financial products into one tightly-knit system .  
" The only purpose of financial operations is to turn a profit . There 's no such thing as moral or immoral , and no such thing as it being fair or unfair to hardworking individual countries or firms , " says Ding Kung-wha , highlighting the pragmatic and unsentimental nature of the financial world .  
In the 70s and 80s , as productive capacity continuously expanded , manufacturing profitability fell and marketing came to play the leading role , with control of brands and distribution channels the key to success . Today , competition is still more intense , and profits from both production and distribution are small . Only the rich earnings offered by financial operations are still attractive . " This is how Ding Kung-wha characterizes the global trend .  
Many conveniences are provided to make financial operations easier , and because the figures in investors ' account books do not represent physical assets they can be moved in an instant . Also , easier and easier availability of credit , in the form of unsecured loans and margin accounts ( either for buying on margin with borrowed money , or for selling on margin with borrowed shares ) , has allowed many people to grow accustomed to conducting transactions worth 10 times the capital they themselves put in .  
Furthermore , as investors grow more sophisticated and experienced , " direct participation " in financial markets , in which individual investors take risks themselves and can earn higher profits , is playing an ever greater role in advanced Western countries : shares , bonds , mutual funds and even options have all become part of the everyday life of white-collar workers .  
" This is the worldwide trend , and we ca n't buck it . " Ding Kung-wha says that most people can still choose to remain aloof and not go playing the numbers game , but if the financial sector continues to expand , and with possible inflation , in the end they will find themselves with inadequate spending power . Looking at it that way , will people finally have no choice than to get involved in the precarious and irrational financial markets ?  
Back then , the region had " poor people and few financial resources , bandits running amok , and backward culture . " Chiang first dealt with the local bandits , organizing four large public security squads , and he personally went out to the countryside to oversee efforts to quell bandit activities . Then , he moved to lay public roads , so as to facilitate transportation throughout the area .  
Among the heavy responsibilities weighing on the superintendent 's shoulders , besides having to find financial donations , is that of finding people . Recruiting local doctors has proved difficult-several times when the hospital advertised for staff there were very few applicants , and some doctors who did agree to come and work subsequently changed their minds when another opportunity came up . The disappointed Huang Sheng-hsiung saw no choice but to cast his net wider , and try to recruit doctors from America .  
But in regard to this question , the international community wants the cross-strait problem to be resolved peacefully . Though most countries accept the " one China " principle , and recognize the mainland regime as its representative , Taiwan 's democratic development and economic efforts have drawn great international attention and affirmation . In particular , Taiwan 's stability during the recent financial turmoil in Southeast Asia is evidence that Taiwan plays a critical role in ensuring the economic prosperity and regional security of East Asia .  
It is true that after the financial crisis struck there was no massive fall in the value of the Yen , but the combination of external pressures and internal difficulties-in the form of an overall default rate on bank lending of 14% , the collapse of several financial institutions , and the economic sluggishness which has dogged Japan for the last seven years-has been enough to leave the Japanese government bruised and battered .  
He also cites the example of the German software company SAP , which has risen to prominence in recent years . He explains that the company has tapped into the demand created by businesses ' need to restructure , by designing integrated software for human resource management , financial management , accounting and materials management . SAP has become the global leader in software for " enterprise resource planning , " with an annual turnover of US $ 4 billion .  
In order to create space and support in international relations , Vincent Siew has visited Southeast Asia numerous times since accepting the post of premier . During the financial meltdown , it became evident that in light of Taiwan 's close links to the financial system of Southeast Asia , we must at all times keep a friendly hand extended in that direction .  
As for tax revenue , the Ministry of Finance declared that the provincial government budget will be incorporated into the overall central government budget , while provincial sales tax will become national tax , to be allocated directly by the central government to local cities and counties . Premier Siew gave assurances that the details of financial administration will be ironed out no later than December 1 .  
At present , the mainland 's economic development is limited by serious corruption , and by the growing disparity between the standards of living of rural and urban areas , and of the coast and the interior . If these problems can not be resolved , and with the pressure from the USA on the whole of Southeast Asia , the financial crisis will continue to worsen .  
At the same time , in order to stabilize a stock market battered by the news of financial crises at many firms , a stock market stabilization committee headed by the MOF held its first meeting on November 16 . The committee has confirmed that it has arranged for a total of NT $ 283 billion from a number of sources to buy shares . The sources of this money include postal deposits , the civil-service and labor pension funds , the labor insurance fund , the government-run banks and insurance companies .  
In late 1997 , in response to the general sense of powerlessness throughout society that year following three major criminal cases , an epidemic of porcine foot and mouth disease and the Asian financial crisis , Huang Wu-hsiung again wrote an article putting forward the idea of community colleges . In it he stated : " The aim is not only to provide the public with lifelong opportunities for education , but also to revitalize Taiwanese society through knowledge and discussion , the operation of civic groups and the exchange of skills . "  
On the question of KPS setting up its own channel , Father Raymond Parent notes that when he was a member of the Government Information Office 's nine-member research team on cable television , he felt that the remit set by the GIO was too narrow , and the pace of legal reform too slow . With the chaotic situation of the time , when all cable channels were illegal , it would have been very difficult for KPS , with its limited financial resources , to enter this market .  
Dr . Sheih says that kidney disease has long been one of the ten leading causes of death in Taiwan . " Both kidney transplant patients and dialysis patients have to endure considerable pain , " he observes . In addition to this physical suffering , before the introduction of universal health insurance in Taiwan kidney disease was a tremendous financial burden for patients ; now that dialysis is covered by National Health Insurance , it is a substantial item of the system 's expenditure .  
For instance , before we broke ties with one nation , it informed us that it was facing economic collapse , that for eight months government workers had received no pay and that there had been three attempted military coups . They asked for US $ 120 million in loans or financial assistance , but this would only have been enough to meet their short-term debts .  
Setting up in a foreign country was no easy task , particularly given that before BMI was established , the Bank of Hawaii and the Bank of Guam had already divided up the local financial market between them . Because the local savings rate was low but the borrowing rate was high , Chen decided that the only way to gain the upper hand as a latecomer was to offer more efficient lending operations .  
Looking at the larger environment , in recent years , the global financial crisis and cross-strait tensions have caused economic turbulence , and firms have closed factories and laid off personnel . The situation has been especially serious in the mass media . In all areas of media , including TV , radio , newspapers , and magazines , the market is saturated , and few people are leaving their jobs .  
Other fields are also booming : With Y2K just around the corner , demand for computer experts is rising . There 's a great demand for marketing personnel in the mobile phone industry . The financial , insurance , and real estate industries are moving toward increasing professionalization and are absorbing and training a large number of new people .  
Minister without portfolio Yang Shih-chien , who handles domestic technology policy , explains : " Innovation is everything in high-technology . A brilliant , ground-breaking idea can open up a whole new field of industry . But innovation requires huge quantities of financial and human resources dedicated to R &amp; D , with laboratories pursuing technological breakthroughs around the clock , and with professional investment managers able to turn innovative ideas into products and profits . "  
Yu Tzong-shian explains that a financial economy is characterized by high risk plus high profits . With rapid flows of information and capital it becomes essential to establish fair rules of the game , along with a tight regulatory regime for the finance sector .  
The domestic financial crisis which afflicted Taiwan from the middle of last year until early this year , exposed several legally dubious forms of high-risk transaction , including excess loans , and high rates of stock collateral for company directors . Recently , the former president of the Control Yuan , Wang Tso-yung , publicly labeled the Taiwan stockmarket a " cannibal market . " The challenges of a financial economy have clearly only just begun to emerge , and economic policy will probably now confront more difficulties and resistance than ever .  
Misery and suffering left in the wake of the 21 September Chichi earthquake are still apparent over a wide area , but rebuilding continues non-stop , and appraisal of damage to buildings in the disaster areas has been completed . The government has been busy distributing financial help and contributions sent by sympathetic onlookers , and temporary housing for 4,500 families will be completed by the middle of November . These are just the first steps in post-disaster relief efforts however ; full-scale recovery still has a long way to go .  
This law should have a positive effect for current BOT projects which are facing obstacles , including the high-speed railway and the proposed rapid transit line to CKS International Airport . There will now be a legal basis for the high-speed railway to raise more capital . Also , now that the regulations for establishing new towns have been revised , the proposed plan to build a mass transit line to the airport by the Chang Yi financial group can become reality .  
3 . Regulations on a national financial stabilization fund : This law will empower the government to intervene to protect the stock market . In the event of " threats to national stability " - such as major internal or external events , rapid movements of international capital-the government will be able to draw on an NT $ 500 billion fund .  
Legal restraint involves legislation and enforcement . We must first undertake the appropriate legislative tasks , and amend laws governing political contributions , lobbying , political parties , compulsory trusts , and election rules . Once completed , the laws can only be effective if they are strictly enforced . Thus law-enforcement agencies must be able to thoroughly enforce laws in order to prevent financial interests and political interests from working together behind the scenes for illicit ends .  
Looking at this list , commentators have identified a number of characteristics : a broad , cross-party base ; attention to economic and financial issues ; emphasis on professional ability ; and stress on the appointment of women and of outstanding people from outside central government .  
A particularly testing time was the Asian financial crisis , starting in July 1997 , when the economy stumbled and the stock market index collapsed to 5000 points . The government responded by immediately cutting corporate taxes in the financial sector . This helped the industry to overcome bad debts , triggered a rebound on the stock market , and enabled the banking sector to provide relief for businesses , thus enabling Taiwan to ride out the worst of the storm .  
One major problem that has come to light is the chaotic state of Taiwan 's financial system . The KMT government was forever being criticized for allowing the intrusion of politics into the financial arena-the collusion between big money , organized crime , and political forces that is referred to as " black and gold ruling in tandem . "  
As Hsia Chen points out , the KMT needed votes so it formed a symbiotic relationship with the financial apparatus at the local level : " Give me your votes , and you can suckle here in return . " Bank directors are often involved with local factions , and operate as influential " vote captains " at election time , so it 's difficult for political forces not to get involved whenever a problem crops up .  
At the time the country was already running into financial difficulties , and social welfare expenditures were growing rapidly . Based on her solid financial and tax background and her incredible ability with figures , she came to serve as the gate-keeper . In 1995 , she became the first female director of the DNT , and within less than half a year she was named as director of the FTC .  
Dong enjoys enthusiastic support from the local community , which has provided him with generous financial assistance , manpower , filming locations , and more . The quality of his work , moreover , is well recognized ; he has received Golden Harvest Awards for Short Film and Video , Golden Ribbon Awards , and China Times Express Film Awards . He has also entered numerous works in major film festivals in Japan , Canada , Australia , and Singapore .  
Supreme Lawgiver Lin Chi-hsiung stresses that he can " cross the air to effect a cure . " Someone who is sick merely needs to put the receiver of a phone by the ill part of a body , and Lin can order the " airborne agents of the Way " to cross the sea and " exorcise the demons . " Then Lin shouts " ha " into the phone nine times and-voila ! - the patient is cured . A necessary prerequisite , however , is that the patient vow to make a financial contribution .  
On October 14 , the cabinet 's economic task force further announced eight major economic policies . These included eliminating the business tax for financial institutions , instituting a " no tax hike " policy for this presidential term , permitting the appropriate use of foreign labor , establishing a guarantee fund to provide preferential loans , allowing foreign asset management firms to handle bad loans , assisting small and medium firms to upgrade their technology , leasing out government land in industrial zones , and taking active steps to prevent electricity and water supply shortages .  
Women were dependent , the instruments of reproduction . But the industrial revolution changed all that . Women joined the production lines , home appliances reduced the time and energy women had to spend in the home , and liberated women began to enter society . As women have become equals in terms of financial support of the family , society has been transformed , and the forms of the family have become diversified .  
Politicians , academics , the media , and ordinary people are therefore all misusing the term when they employ it to describe the financial power of hei dao ( which literally translates as " the black way " and means " organized crime " ) or jin niu ( which translates literally as " gold bulls " and means " wealthy individuals who use their money for political leverage " ) . Moreover , this incorrect usage is only gaining prevalence the more it is used .  
Amid the crowds and the hubbub at the Sogo in Taipei , Taiwan 's top-grossing department store , it 's clear that these kitties bring more than just good financial fortune . Check out this rack full of copycat charms that have come from Japan on Maneki Neko 's tail . Take , for instance , this litter of Fengshui Kitties , lined up here with each holding a different colored pearl : red , purple , blue , white or yellow .  
Last year during the transition of power to a new administration , Lai 's financial expertise and ability to coordinate across issue areas did not go unnoticed . After taking the post of vice premier , he immediately proposed a number of policies of fundamental importance , including putting the financial system in order , helping traditional industries , upgrading infrastructure , promoting job creation , and inviting public participation . These outline the hopes of the new government for economic and financial development .  
Since the beginning of this year the government has held a series of national conferences on economic development , administrative reform , industrial development , and science and technology . It has also adopted a dizzying array of measures designed to stimulate the economy , including plans to spur domestic demand , bolster the property market , create job opportunities , and promote mergers between financial institutions .  
From the 1950s , after the Nationalist Government moved to Taiwan , Li served in such posts as chairman of the Industrial Development Commission , economic affairs minister and minister of finance , charting Taiwan 's economic , financial and technological development policies with bold vision . His emphasis on creating a favorable investment environment and cultivating new talent brought to Taiwan an unending flow of development projects , and earned him respect as Taiwan 's " Father of Technological Development " and " Architect of the Economic Miracle . "  
Over the past 50 years , no other individual has been appointed to ministerial posts overseeing all three areas of economic , financial and technological development affairs . During his long tenure guiding economic and financial policy , he nearly single-handedly planted the seeds for the development of Taiwan 's information industry .  
Chiang warns , " If you take a bank job , you 'd better be ready to bone up on the financial industry , sharpen your sales skills , and become a multi-talented money management advisor . " Financial products are complex and come in infinite variety . Banks badly need powerful systems for integrating financial information , so computer specialists with a strong quantitative grasp of the business will be highly valued by their employers .  
President Chen has also instructed Taiwan 's financial and economic community that regardless of whether the US fights a quick or a protracted war , Taiwan must respond with flexibility by stabilizing the equity and currency markets and guaranteeing the supply of crude oil , agricultural raw materials , and staple commodities .  
Looked at another way , the 36 local financial institutions that the government recently took over account for less than 1% of the total amount of banking business nationally . Yet , even this tiny tip of the iceberg will cost NT $ 70 billion to clean up , which is a full half of the revenues that are expected to come into the restructuring fund over the next five years .  
Thus , while the first shots fired for financial reform may look good , those on the inside can not help but worry that the government will quickly run out of ammunition . Yet there would still remain more than 300 other community financial institutions which have been running at a loss for a considerable time , not to mention the state-run and private banks of a much larger scale whose bad debts are shockingly high . The govern-ment 's ability to reform the financial system is going to face some pretty ruthless tests .  
Since the middle of this year , Citibank ( acting through Debenham Tie Leung , a property management firm based in Hong Kong ) has held a series of auctions in Taipei and Kao-hsiung to sell properties from defaulted mortgages at steep discounts . Prices at these auctions have been about 60% of the open market price , sending shock waves through the real estate and financial industries .  
Peter Kurz , CEO of the investment consulting firm Insight Pacific , observes that although Taiwan 's non-performing loan ratio is increasing , the amount for dishonored checks and bills has not correspondingly risen . " This indicates , " he explains " that the rise in the non-performance ratio is a result of the government 's increasingly strict oversight of the financial sector , and the increasing transparency of bank operations , which in fact are positive things from the point of view of foreign investors . "  
Internationally , the trend is certainly for the big to get bigger . For example , at the end of 1997 , Union Bank of Switzerland merged with Swiss Bank Corporation , and the following year Deutsche Bank purchased Bankers Trust , while Citibank merged with Travelers Group . This last merger , between two companies that were already giants , gave the resulting firm a solid grip on its ranking as the financial institution with the highest net worth in the world .  
" If you divide the financial sector up into state-run banks , private local banks , and foreign banks , the most at-risk group is that made up of the large state-run banks , which currently have the largest market share , " says Schive Chi , who knows what he 's talking about after years of experience in banking . The style of foreign banks is to make quick decisions based on comprehensive data , wielding a flexible array of products that keep up with the market .  
One figure in the business privately complains , " The government has always coddled Taiwan 's banks under the rubric of ' maintaining financial stability , ' and the banks have gotten used to it . You ca n't ask them to get lean and mean overnight . " The financial sector serves as the circulatory system feeding economic development . Taiwan has a powerful manufacturing sector , but a weak financial sector , which has always been a drag on overall national development .  
Take Citicorp , for example . Although it has a good image , offers comprehensive financial services , and is creative with its management methods , it has been frustrated to find that its business has remained limited to foreign firms and members of the economic elite . It has continued to be unsuccessful in entering the mass market .  
Not only does this allow the government , which has in recent years been in dire financial straits , to strengthen social welfare policies , each week it gives birth to several newly wealthy individuals . Over the long run , this will certainly have a positive impact on stimulating consumption . Of course , many people are not very pleased with the fondness of Taiwanease for gambling and the reliance on luck , and even more are worried about the government being the " house " and everyone thinking only about money .  
The townships are in an even more embarrassing financial condition , with many of them relying on supplementary allocations for more than 90% of their expenditures . The fact that local governments are entirely dependent on financial support from higher up the chain of government , and that all expenditure has to be approved at a higher level too , makes the entire concept of local self-rule a farce .  
According to a handbook entitled Medical Disputes Q &amp; A compiled by the Taiwan Health Reform Foundation , the types of redress most patients and their families wish for are : a reasonable explanation ; a sincere apology from the hospital and doctors ; financial responsibility to be taken for the continuing medical care of the patient ; hospitals and doctors to learn lessons ; proposals for specific reform measures ; action to prevent similar mistakes happening again ; substantive punishment for wrongdoers ; reasonable monetary damages or compensation ; and only last of all , criminal penalties .  
AVRDC director Samson C.S . Tsou points out that in nearly 30 years in Taiwan , the center 's accomplishments include raising both the quality and yields of a wide variety of tropical vegetables , including tropical tomatoes , vegetable soybeans , and crucifers . Its staff have also worked to improve the nutritional status and incomes of people in developing countries around Asia . Taiwan has been the primary source of financial support , accounting for nearly 60% of the center 's US $ 10 million budget .  
Among other things , the draft Political Party Law stipulates that in the future all political parties will be prohibited from operating or investing in profit-making enterprises or non-print mass media , and they must periodically report their financial holdings . The law further specifies that parties ' existing commercial assets must either be sold off or placed in a blind trust within two years of the law 's promulgation .  
Gay film director Mickey Chen 's experience is a good case in point . His video Not Simply a Wedding Banquet , a documentary of Taiwan 's first public gay wedding , was entered into numerous international film festivals , but Chen was turned down when he applied to the Government Information Office for financial support to enter the work in a film festival . The incident elicited a storm of protest from the artistic community , especially from noted author Hsiao Yeh . Critics charged the GIO with " anti-gay discrimination . "  
At the end of June , the Executive Yuan established a special team to outline financial reforms . Invoking existing banking laws , the Ministry of Finance announced a tiered management policy for the credit departments of farmers ' and fishermen 's associations . The goal was to follow up on the August 2001 partial intervention ( in which a special fund was used to take over and restructure 36 of the worst-run ones ) by tackling the widespread problem of unrepaid loans at these credit institutions , to protect farmers ' real interests .  
Ku enthusiastically consults with people from all areas , and has done his utmost to assist domestic research in fields related to welding . Ku also contributes by " resuscitating " expensive machinery damaged by human errors or natural disasters , thus helping industry and educational institutions reduce the massive financial losses that can result from such events . While his work has guaranteed that machinery works , he has helped even more people by passing the torch of his knowledge on to his students .  
Moreover , there is national financial distress with the government deficit exceeding NT $ 3 trillion . If loans are raised to hire unemployed workers , then a balanced budget will not be attainable within the foreseeable future . This bill would also dampen the improving economy and delay financial reform efforts , and the misallocation of resources would influence larger government projects , and be detrimental to long-term economic growth .  
In theory , highly educated children with abundant financial resources ought to have more power to fulfill their filial duties , but an industrial and commercial society values material gain and shows little concern about separation . People of higher status often have to invest more and more energy in their careers . " Why is it that the more people study the less filial they seem ? " wonders Chang Meng-jui , a senior reporter at the Min Sheng Daily who is a long-time observer of social phenomena .  
Of course , it is asking a lot of any hospital to be a designated SARS hospital , and it is a rather terrifying prospect for the staff there . For this reason all hospitals should contribute to the staffing of the special facility in rotation-time spent caring for patients , a ' vacation ' in quarantine , and then a return to their original hospitals . Staff must also be provided with the best possible protective gear and financial bonuses , so that the sense of anxiety felt by caregivers can be reduced to a minimum .  
Sun Yung-ching observes that " in industrial education , time is money . " The central reason why technical and vocational students are unable to meet the demands of industry is that the equipment they need to train on is too expensive . Schools are unable to meet the financial burden of constantly upgrading facilities and industry is unwilling to receive students for training in their plants , on the one hand because of the possible impact on output , but also out of genuine concern that students could damage precision machinery .  
Lin Chin-chu explains that some people in the area want to develop hot springs along the river , but often when hot springs areas are developed , large financial groups rush in and the tribal peoples lose control . As a result , not only do local people not reap benefits , but in the process the natural environment on which they depend for their living is damaged .  
In markets that are jointly monopolized , large financial consortiums move fast , attracting the general public in order to make a killing . Then these companies pursue various philanthropic activities to show their compassionate side , by making public displays of charitable donations to the people of Lanyu ( even if the people there have no need of their gifts ) or funding protection of sea turtles on Lanyu ( even if the extra funds actually result in more harm to the turtles ) .  
Who can avoid the reach of multi-media consortiums , with their tremendous financial resources and influence ? They can take in politicians who are down on their luck ; and even those who want to get public exposure to express their own ideas end up surrendering to the media . The result is that no one-neither the idealistic politician nor the deep thinker-ends up staying true to personal principles .  
Anyone who has traveled to Kyoto is sure to remember the streets and alleyways lined with elegant and well-maintained traditional Japanese-style residences in which people still live . Strolling those streets one feels the spirit of Japanese literature . These spaces are perhaps unsuitable to financial calculations of their worth . But their value in terms of cultural history is something that even greater economic power could not buy .  
Looking back over the financial history of Taiwan , when the Nationalist government first moved to Taiwan , it experienced hyperinflation and financial collapse , during which paper currency became worthless . Perhaps as a result of this harsh lesson , from the 1950s to the 1990s , the government maintained a very conservative posture , and its finances were continually in a healthy state .  
Because financial magazines from Taiwan are still a touchy subject in the mainland , as well as concerns about the ability of mainland editors and reporters to live up to the Commonwealth standard , they have started a new magazine . Last year they started publishing Dongfang Qiyejia in Shanghai , sourcing their launch issue 's content from the senior staff of Commonwealth , to make absolutely certain to produce a magazine just as high in quality as its Taiwanese counterpart .  
Asked what areas of personal concern they feel they most need to address , respondents answered , in order of priority : job skills or professional abilities and knowledge ( 30.1% ) ; personal economic or financial situation ( 21.5% ) ; foreign language ability ( 11.2% ) ; level of academic achievement ( 9.6% ) ; quality of life or place of residence ( 5.2% ) ; and religious or spiritual growth ( 2.6% ) .  
Looking at the question from the " support " side , elderly people have more financial and physical ability to look after themselves , so aged parents no longer need to rely on their children . Also , young people are now putting off marriage until much later , so they have much more time under their personal control . Finally , young people have their own marketable skills and incomes , so they do n't need to be under the thumb of their parents . For all these reasons , a carefree life seems a good choice .  
Some say the family is like a refuge where members can find shelter from life 's trials and hardships . Others say the family is like a financial institution that provides for daily necessities . Some people liken the family to a silk cocoon-warm and comfortable but closed off and restrictive . Yet others liken the family to a poisonous snake where members are bound together , but by bonds of hatred and dislike instead of love and caring .  
According to Chi , single mothers receive very little support in Taiwan . At the GHF , for example , only a minority of girls who decide to keep their baby get any financial or emotional support from their parents , and then only after considerable resistance from them . Most unmarried girls who choose the hard road of raising their child , do so without the proper skills or support from their family or boyfriend .  
Their medicinal work was mostly done at night , after their day 's farmwork was done . Kung had loved drawing since childhood , and spent all his money on art supplies for his hobby . With the family in rough financial shape and art hardly a viable way to make a living , Kung 's father was n't impressed with this obsession , and would often sternly tell Kung off for it , so he carried on with his artwork behind his father 's back . Gourds and Chinese macrame  
The Ministry of Finance should rigorously investigate and hold banks accountable for administrative and criminal liability in this area . Next time a financial institution is found to have leaked customers ' confidential information , the paper suggests , it should be penalized by being barred or restricted from opening new branches or starting new lines of business .  
These " financial monsters " can certainly rely on the synergy of large scale and cross-financial industry operations to be more competitive worldwide . But an enterprise that 's like an octopus with intertwining tentacles everywhere can of course easily hide its evil ways . It must be overseen by a more professional , more authoritative financial organization with special regulatory responsibilities that can operate on a higher moral plane .  
Based on these two criteria , the CEPD has compiled a list of 12 critical service industries for future development . These are : financial services ; research and development ; design ; cultural and creative services ; telecommunications and media ; medical , health care and caregiving ; engineering consulting ; information services ; distribution and transportation ; manpower training , manpower services and property management ; tourism , sporting and recreational services ; and environmental protection .  
This agreement guarantees that the reimbursement that the hospital receives for a quarter will be equal to what it received in the same quarter the previous year . However , any claims exceeding this sum will not be honored by the BNHI . In other words , if a hospital 's expenditures surpass the upper limit set by the BNHI , it will likewise face a situation where the more health care services it provides , the greater its financial losses .  
During a three-day meeting on this respiratory tract disease , WHO endorsed the content of a research report , which indicated " strong political commitment , adequate financial resources and sound technology " have substantially reduced the burden of tuberculosis to India and China .  
Dr . Hani introduced that the Afghan interim government submitted the government budget of the 2002 fiscal year of a total sum of 0.46-billion USD in the meeting of the Executive Team of Aids to Afghanistan held in April . Because the financial income of the interim government was very limited , there was a gap of 0.4-billion US dollars in the budget that needed to be filled up by international aids .  
Local experts believe that the establishment of the committee will be beneficial to the drafting of state currency policies , improving the level of decision making on the macro financial level , and bolstering the sustained , rapid and healthy development of the national economy  
" Hong Kong now enjoys social stability , and the situation is encouraging , " the spokesman said , noting that over the past century the people of Hong Kong have built their home with hard work and wisdom , which is typical of the Chinese nation as a whole , into an important international trade , financial and shipping center  
Since Myanmar reformed its financial and banking system in recent years , 39 foreign bank representative offices and 17 local private banks have been set up in the capital  
The spokesman said that the success of the capital increase is an inevitable result of the improvement of China 's comprehensive national power With the rising of international status , China will surely play an even more active role in international economic and financial sectors  
Recognize that both China and South Africa share many objectives with regard to key multilateral issues and on the urgent need for the reform of the international multilateral political , economic and financial architecture to reflect new global realities  
" While the adjustments may be difficult for a time , these crises will pass , " he said , stressing that " stronger individual economies and a more robust and efficient international economic and financial system will surely emerge in their wake "  
Since then , financial markets have become more stable and the economy has continued to grow at a surprisingly robust rate During the final three months of last year , it shot up at a 5 6 percent annual rate , the strongest in two and a half years  
The recent financial crisis in southeast and east Asia has created a series of problems affecting economic development in the region , said Lee However , he expressed his belief that China can withstand the test and maintain the sustained and healthy development of economy by adopting continuous readjustments  
He said that China succeeded in carrying out economic reforms in the frame of the original political system , while Russia , supported by western countries , had first embarked on political reform and become mired in financial crisis and heavy corruption  
elected deputy to the fifth and seventh npc , vice chairman of the standing committee of seventh npc , and chairman of financial and economic committee of npc elected member of the cpc 10th 14th central committee and alternative member of the political bureau of cpc 11th and 12th central committee  
" It is beneficial to all countries to enhance regional and international financial cooperation , maintain normal international financial order , jointly ward off the impact of excessive speculation of hot money in the world and create a favorable financial environment , " the Chinese leader said  
He said that since its founding five years ago , Eximbank has established an effective risk preventing mechanism in extending loans , and that the quality of the bank 's credit assets remains high , and the principal and interest of mature financial bonds have all been paid , ensuring the rights and interests of creditors  
kiev , february 24 ( xinhua ) the ukrainian parliament today stressed that the republic of crimea is an autonomous part of ukraine , and can not have its own armed forces , monetary and financial system , or develop political ties with foreign nations  
the session decided to approve the inclusion of the project in the ten year program for national economic and social development , and authorize the state council to carry it out at an appropriate time , in light of the actual development of the national economy and the country 's financial and material force  
Dominique Casier , FBA chairman and chief representative of the Beijing Office of the General Bank of Belgium , told the conference that foreign financial institutions are interested in Henan 's economic construction and in developing other central and western areas  
It said the authors of the report also need to address the unjust global economic system and financial monopolies which aggravate poverty in the developing countries and even provide incentives for corruption leading to massive transfers of assets to benefit the already rich societies  
He said he is extremely pleased with the fact that the financial situation in ROK has reached a major turning point in its most difficult period and attributed the success to the efforts of the ROK government and people He expressed hope that ROK will overcome current difficulties and regain economic vitality at the earliest possible date  
A steering committee has been established at the Secretariat level to plan and coordinate all technical , administrative , logistical and financial aspects of the Conference , which includes representatives of all relevant offices of the Secretariat ;  
In the case of Benin , the transition from a centrally directed economy to a liberal market economy required a conducive legal , financial and economic environment to stimulate national entrepreneurship and revitalize the private sector .  
The substantial financial contribution of the Government was stressed and in that connection the Assistant Administrator confirmed that , given its present level of contributions , UNDP would meet only the costs of the resident representative .  
They have had the difficult task of providing subsidized loans to risky ventures and inefficient public enterprises , which often has forced Governments to recapitalize them with financial transfers from an already overburdened government budget .  
At the same time , major financial institutions and donors have acquired a profound role in determining recipient countries ' budgets , social and economic policies , and , to some extent , political institutions .  
Ad hoc expert groups : a meeting will be held on national development experiences and policies with regard to domestic economic management , mobilizing financial and human resources and the roles of the public and private sectors ( 1994 ) .  
The most pressing financial questions before the United Nations involve paying the bills for ongoing operations and raising the funds to pay for its foreseeable obligations in peace-keeping , humanitarian relief and sustainable development .  
The Croatian Government and the public and private sector were widely represented and exchanged views with most major international financial and technical assistance bodies and financial experts from all parts of the world .  
The international community 's commitment to sustainable development in Africa can best be enhanced by encouraging increased direct foreign investment , as well as an increased international transfer of financial resources to the region .  
That is why we ask for the unfailing support and backing of the international community , which , we feel , should in the short - , medium - and long-term involve substantial , increased and strengthened technical and financial cooperation . 
With its limited financial and human resources , it is trying to control the problem at the national level , and to contribute at a regional and international level in an integrated and comprehensive manner .  
" Noting that those developing countries which have continued , at great cost , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite severe external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Noting that those developing countries which have continued , at great cost , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite severe external and domestic financial constraints ,  
The Committee further reaffirmed that the activities of foreign economic , financial and other interests operating at present in the colonial Territories constituted a major obstacle to political independence and racial equality .  
In order to pay the price of political and socioeconomic liberalization , we need , in addition to substantial financial assistance , considerable support and understanding from the entire international community .  
We know that , even with the mineral wealth with which South Africa has been blessed , it will be no easy task for the new Government to correct the social and economic injustices of the past while maintaining the country on a sound financial footing .  
In terms of the international community , the level of financial support has consistently fallen short of requirements .  To a great extent this can be attributed to the economic difficulties experienced by industrialized countries in recent years .  
A main point to note in that regard is that transfers might not be successful if they are not accompanied by adequate economic and financial resources at provincial and local levels . 
The development of an integrated mining system that would be operational in an actual deep seabed environment on a sustained basis is demanding both in terms of time and effort and requires substantial financial inputs .  
Noting that those developing countries which have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debtservice obligations in a timely fashion , have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
With reductions in international and regional tensions , and with the growing recognition of global economic and environmental interdependence , the opportunity to mobilize human and financial resources for global problemsolving has never been greater .  
In a growing number of countries , the private sector has or is fast developing the financial , managerial and technological capacity to carry out a vast array of such activities in an effective and costefficient manner .  
Moreover , at the international level , prospects for achieving adequate , predictable , new and additional financial flows to developing countries for sustainable development are fraught with many challenges .  
Noting that those developing countries which have continued , at great cost , to meet their international debt and debtservice obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite severe external and domestic financial constraints ,  
The rapid and complete collapse of the previous system in the last years of the 1980s was characterized by a demoralizing and debilitating paralysis of the political , economic , financial , administrative and social structures of the country .  
Moreover , at the international level , there is no clear evidence as yet of the provision of adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , in particular to developing countries , for sustainable development .  
Governments in the region , by and large , have followed conservative fiscal and financial policies , enabling them to maintain reasonable degrees of economic stability coupled generally with sustained high levels of economic activity .  
An interim multilateral fund was created to assist developing countries meet their incremental costs ( mainly technical and financial ) resulting from the adoption of substitute technologies to help them comply with the Protocol 's phaseout provisions .  
What is critical is that these managers are both empowered with the skills and tools to realize the full potential of staff and are then held accountable for both the human and financial resources for which they are made responsible .  
However , it was pointed out that as a result of the increased demand for " cartographic products " , governmentfunded national surveys had a bright future , subject to good leadership , adaptation to technological advances and increased financial selfreliance .  
An initial investment in social organization at the local level is followed by financial support to implement certain key communal projects which respond to priority needs identified by rural communities themselves .  
During the 1980s , most developing countries faced mounting domestic and external financial imbalances that resulted in unsustainable fiscal deficits and reduced public and private financial flows .  
Frequently absent is the necessary matrix of legislative , regulatory , financial and fiscal systems conducive to the creation of a favourable and predictable environment in which entrepreneurship and the private sector can contribute to economic development .  
A dozen countries in Asia and Latin America , characterized by financial analysts as " emerging markets " , received most of the capital inflow , while the vast majority of developing countries have not been touched by the growth in net financial transfers .  
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
The meeting urged subregional and regional banking / financial institutions to channel the greater part of their resources towards the private sector , creating indigenous capital markets , rather than depend on the existing ones controlled by foreign interests .  
The initial focus is on the identification , quantification and analysis of technical , scientific , social , legal , financial , political and other factors affecting the quality and quantity of freshwater resources in selected small island developing States .  
The global partnership for sustainable development entered into during the recent years was based on the provision to the developing countries of substantial , new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements .  
Reforms this year included a substantial cut in corporate taxes , sharp reduction in import tariffs on capital goods and industrial inputs , financial sector liberalization and full currency convertibility on the current account .  
Most developing countries had implemented economic reforms on the advice of the developed countries and international financial institutions , but at great social and political cost .  
At the global level , the external debt crisis of the developing countries no longer threatened the financial health of private international banks .  
Such efforts should bring together those responsible for economic , financial and social policy and provide an integrated framework for guiding national and international policies aimed at meeting the current challenges of the world economy .  
A conducive external environment was essential , and the developed countries should employ sound macroeconomic policies , particularly in the area of trade liberalization , financial flows and monetary stability .  
Official development assistance , so important for developing countries that were unable to attract private financial flows , continued to decline both in real terms and in proportion to the gross national product ( GNP ) of developing countries . 
While national Governments were primarily responsible for implementing Agenda 21 and other environmental instruments the developing countries lacked the financial resources and technology to do so without continued and enhanced international cooperation .  
In the light of the foregoing and in spite of the amounts held in suspense , starting with General Assembly resolution 34 / 9 E , the financial burden on troop contributors has not so far been alleviated owing to the high level of outstanding contributions .  
This backstopping covers operational , political , military , humanitarian , legal , logistical , financial , personnel and other administrative aspects of peacekeeping operations .  
The continent remained highly vulnerable to inequitable international economic policies , it was a frequent victim of natural disasters and it had an overwhelming debt burden at a time when financial flows were drying up and commodity prices remained low .  
" Alarmed by the high cost of organized transnational crime in both human and material terms , as well as by its effects on national economies , the global financial system , and the rule of law and fundamental social values ,  
That poor performance was attributable to a number of factors : unfavourable climatic conditions , the external debt burden , inadequate external financial support , political and social strife , to name a few .  
As the growing financial obligation which Member States must bear for peacekeeping operations was of vital importance , all countries , developed and developing alike , were encouraged to pay their contributions on time in accordance with their capacity .  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debtservice obligations in a timely fashion , have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Noting that those developing countries which have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debtservice obligations in a timely fashion , have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Reiterates that any administering or occupying Power that deprives the colonial peoples of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
The European Union , as it has already stated on previous occasions , particularly in the High-level Working Group on the Financial Situation of the United Nations , attaches the greatest political importance to the need to find a solution to the Organization 's financial crisis in order to establish a solid , permanent financial base for the Organization , thus enabling the United Nations to carry out all the mandates entrusted to it .  
We should also stress the support of friendly countries directly interested in the region , particularly those that have cooperated , and continue to cooperate , with the Secretary-General in the search for political solutions , and those that have provided technical and financial assistance for the implementation of special programmes of cooperation designed to supplement the peace efforts by attacking the structural causes of our problems and strengthening the democratic process . 
The concerted efforts of the international community must be directed towards , and must lead to , concrete programmes of action and the consolidation of an effective platform for international cooperation , with the support of the Secretariat and the agencies of the United Nations system , and also those of the developed countries and world or regional financial bodies for international cooperation .  
As a result of its financial assistance for local environmental health projects , its close ties with municipalities and the Palestinian Authority , and its collaborative relationship with three major solid waste projects in the Gaza Strip , UNRWA was instrumental in achieving coordination and promoting common standards and strategies in the environmental health sector among the Palestinian Authority , local municipalities and non-governmental organizations operating in the Gaza Strip .  
The Government of Ukraine has developed a large-scale national programme aimed at safeguarding the rights of national minorities and indigenous peoples and has established a fund for the deported peoples of Crimea . But for Ukraine , which faces conditions of economic crisis and a complicated financial situation and lacks the necessary infrastructure , services and mechanisms , the task of accommodating the hundreds of thousands of repatriated persons appears too complicated .  
But in the final analysis the proper functioning and efficiency of the United Nations depend first and foremost on the political support that Member States , especially the most powerful , give to multilateralism , as well as the political , military and financial resources they are prepared to make available to international organizations .  
The transfer of major financial resources to and from our markets causes great instability in capital flows in the world , leading to concern and uncertainty , and threatens the accumulated efforts of our peoples to establish a more just , more orderly and more stable economic system .  
We hope that the current negotiations amongst the various international organizations concerned will lead to the desired coordination between monetary , financial and trade policies and thereby lead to the laying of genuine foundations for free international trade , wherein there would be no deterioration in the terms of trade or any decline in the prices of primary commodities .  
Not so much economic or political as ethical in nature , this crisis has weakened our institutions and undermined our financial system , the collapse of which cost us 16 per cent of our gross national product and has attracted the not-always-understanding attention of international opinion . 
We are confident that a Middle East zone free of nuclear and weapons of mass destruction would enhance the peace process and lead to a situation wherein enormous financial resources would be saved and channelled towards the economic prosperity and social development of the peoples of the region .  
In this connection , I join others in calling on the international community to devise a global strategy to effectively address the debt question confronting the least developed countries , and to use innovative measures whether it be official development aid , foreign direct investment or multilateral financial assistance to arrest the decline of resources destined for the least developed countries .  
The debt crisis , depressed prices of primary commodities , protectionist measures , the inadequate flow of direct foreign investment and financial and technical assistance , and deteriorating terms of trade are but a few of the factors adversely affecting socio-economic performance in most of these countries .  It is with this frustrating situation in mind that we intend to continue participating in the work of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group of this Assembly on An Agenda for Development .  
The Islamic Republic of Mauritania which , since 1984 , has been engaged in a determined battle that aims at restructuring the Mauritanian economy despite difficult domestic , regional and international conditions , has made tangible progress towards restoring the macroeconomic balance and reducing its foreign debt , a fact that is attested to by international financial institutions . 
The international community should make its best endeavours to ensure that our efforts are adequately supported through complementary financial and technological support , including improved terms of trade , increased flows of direct foreign investment and appropriate debt relief measures .  
On the contrary , despite our smallness and our relative lack of resources , we have been a consistent and active contributor of troops to various peace-keeping missions .  Fiji has paid a heavy human and financial price for contributing troops , but it has done so gladly and willingly and will continue to do so .  
While the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development at Rio de Janeiro was seen as a defining moment in the quest for sustainability and environmental protection , Fiji regrets that a lack of political commitment , coupled with donor fatigue , has been responsible for the failure of most developed countries to allocate adequate financial resources to enable developing countries to tackle the plethora of problems associated with environmental degradation .  
Indeed , the Fourth World Conference on Women , which ended only last month in Beijing , has given impetus to the need for programmes that speak to the issues of women in development and , most critically , the empowerment of women in local communities , enabling their full participation at all levels in the process of national development .  Grenada is encouraged by the new spirit of international cooperation built on a shared partnership between multilateral financial institutions and Governments .  
We are , however , alert to the dangers associated with that sector and , while pursuing the benefits to be derived from such institutions , we must be ever on guard for white-collar criminals who , as part of their everyday activity , launder their ill-gotten gains through the international financial systems , using both public - and private-sector capital projects for this purpose .  
I am certain that the establishment of a special status , with international security guarantees , consolidated financial and technical assistance and moral incentives , for countries that renounce nuclear weapons would provide a tremendous impetus for expediting the process of nuclear disarmament .  
But the Organization now needs to rethink itself in order to devote all its resources human , financial , institutional and technical to the great undertaking of redressing the unjust economic and social imbalances and the related problems of the environment , in the conviction that this is not only a moral imperative but the ideal way of strengthening peace .  
Countries of the South should not remain trapped in poverty and underdevelopment nor constrained by low commodity prices , unfavourable trade practices , dwindling resource inflows , restrictions in the transfer of technology , unpredictable global monetary and financial systems and external debt burden .  
Therefore , an overall system of enabling mechanisms is necessary , engaging the human , political , economic , financial and socio-cultural resources necessary for the World Programme of Action to be implemented on the national , regional and international level .  
This is the case of the economic , commercial and financial blockade that for more than 34 years has been imposed by the Government of the United States against Cuba , in violation of the most fundamental norms of international law , of peaceful coexistence among sovereign and independent nations , and of freedom of trade and navigation .  
During this year the international community has viewed with deep concern and alarm the approval by the United States Congress of legislative initiatives to move the economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba to unimaginable levels , particularly the new extraterritorial dimensions that the most conservative circles in the Congress want to give to a policy that , since its inception , has been designed to impose United States law on third States .  
The Heads of State or Government called upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial measures and actions against Cuba , which , in addition to being unilateral and contrary to the United Nations Charter , international law and the principle of good neighbourliness , cause huge material losses and economic damage .  
In fact , although the changes that took place in the wake of the cold war led to a certain easing in international relations and promoted , as never before , democratic values , the international situation nevertheless has continued to deteriorate in recent times in the political , economic , social and financial spheres .  
The increase in the number of Member States to 185 ; the end of the cold war and the concomitant , regrettable radicalization of nationalism and group identity , which cause internal and inter-State conflicts ; and the perverse effects of the economic and financial crisis on the democratization of institutions and on human rights all these events and challenges highlight the urgent need to carry out a reform of the United Nations in general and of the Security Council in particular . 
The aim of a comprehensive financial reform must be to establish a transparent and reliable scale , reflective of Members ' real capacity to pay , automatically adaptable to changed national circumstances and giving consideration to the needs of countries with low per capita incomes .  
The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean certainly want such technical cooperation to be increased and more intensified and would like to see the United Nations double or even triple its human and financial efforts in order to fulfil this obligation , which is inscribed in the Charter and in countless resolutions of the General Assembly and other United Nations bodies .  
Indeed , 50 years after its founding , and facing the continuing economic and financial crisis that gravely undermines individual and collective development efforts and is a destabilizing factor for young States and for international peace and security , the United Nations is duty-bound to play a more active , indeed a central , role in promoting economic , social and cultural cooperation in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter .  
For its part , and despite its difficult economic and financial conditions , Cameroon , like other developing countries and African ones in particular , confirming its political will and joining in the expansion of the lofty ideals of the United Nations , recently paid up nearly all its arrears in contributions due the Organization .  
The adoption and future implementation of the prototype for the new format of the medium-term plan for the period 1998 to 2001 , the introduction of a transparent and efficient system of accountability and responsibility , and the decentralization of regional economic commissions and of social and economic activities : all these are reform measures that foster administrative and financial efficiency in the Organization in the economic and social spheres .  
Although useful as a way of promoting the economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries , South-South cooperation is no substitute for international cooperation , which , in the interests of the harmonious development of an interdependent world , must , inter alia , guarantee financial , technical and technological assistance to developing countries .  
In this context , more equitable financial , monetary , trading and technological relations must provide the basis for re-establishing trade as an effective instrument for mutual development , for reconciling peoples and strengthening the international community .  
It was with a deep understanding of global interdependence in the protection of environmental safety on the European continent that the President of Ukraine took the political decision to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant , on condition that adequate international financial and material support be provided .  
In this context , our delegation notes with satisfaction the significant activity of major donor countries and of the international financial organizations , primarily the World Bank , to provide scientific , expert and technological assistance to the Palestinian people to tackle tasks related to the need to improve their social and economic conditions rapidly , strengthen institutions of self-government , establish a financial and banking system , and train highly qualified national personnel .  
It also urged the international community to increase the financial resource flows to Africa , as these are crucial to regenerate economic growth and sustainable development , and to provide effective support to political reforms and help cushion their adverse social consequences .  
On another subject , my delegation fully supports the proposals relating to advancing financial intermediation in Africa , as this is a way to strengthen local savings structures and to link them with modern banks and financial institutions , with a view to generating local resources at this time when official development assistance is dwindling at an unprecedented rate .  
As clearly stated in the report in document A / 50 / 490 , financial systems in Africa are unsophisticated , narrow and shallow , due mainly to general underdevelopment , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pervasive Government intervention in credit allocation .  
Ghana has reduced the direct intervention of the Government in the economy and increased reliance on the market by decontrolling interest rates as a means of raising the rates on savings deposits and loans , reducing subsidies aimed at the promotion of specific sectors or enterprises , privatizing banks and reducing restrictions on financial activities , developing the domestic capital market and easing restrictions on foreign investments in the domestic banking system and capital market .  
It is pertinent to indicate that the financial reforms , as the report before us notes , have so far focused almost exclusively on the formal financial sector and have neglected the informal sector with quite a vast savings potential .  
This new framework of solidarity would break with the almost exclusive , dependence on financial inflows from abroad by better exploiting the potential of trade , private investment and access to technology and reforming international financial institutions so as to better integrate them with other parts of the United Nations system and make them better suited to take care of the needs of poor countries in economic and social development .  
This is so for a number of reasons : first , its long-standing relationship with the countries in and around the conflict area and its consistent policies in favour of a balanced and durable political settlement ; secondly , because of the experience and know-how of Bulgarian companies with a long record of practical work in the area ; thirdly , acquired knowledge and expertise in working with international financial institutions in implementing programmes for reconstruction and development .  
For our part , in addition to supporting the Assembly resolutions on the subject , we have declared a unilateral moratorium on mine production , and with regard to a case which affects us directly the mines planted by our armed forces on the Malvinas Islands in 1982 we have offered our cooperation and financial help to the United Kingdom for their removal , which is proceeding with the greatly appreciated cooperation of the United States .  
In that regard , the Summit called for increased funding for foreign assistance by governmental and non-governmental donors and multilateral financial institutions to specific programmes in primary education for girls , preventive health care and political participation and encouraged developing countries to use the 20 / 20 concept in planning and funding their human development priorities .  
The implementation of the Declaration and Programme of Action will require mobilization of new and additional financial resources at the national and international levels , better and effective utilization of the existing resources , enhanced assistance from the developing countries and a substantial reduction in their debt burden .  
Without this new partnership at the national level , but also at the international level a partnership whose translation into action requires mobilization of the necessary resources by Member States and Bretton Woods multilateral financial institutions our solidarity will be in vain and the social contract worked out in Copenhagen for the well-being of present and future generations will remain a hypothetical goal . 
We see nothing controversial about requesting the administering Powers not to violate the Charter by exploiting the natural resources of the inhabitants of the Non-Self-Governing Territories or in any way subordinating their rights and interests to foreign economic and financial interests .  Is it really wrong to urge these Powers to ensure that acceptable working conditions prevail in these Territories ?  
The road to disarmament is lengthy and arduous but indispensable if the world is to enjoy lasting security and stability , in view of the fact that security and stability are linked to economic and social development and that development requires financial and other resources which are swallowed up by the arms race .  
Secondly , the elimination of nuclear weapons , whether immediate or gradual , would certainly lead to the attainment of a world free of nuclear weapons and eventually of all weapons of mass destruction and would facilitate complete and general disarmament which , in turn , would ease tensions in the world at large and help redirect financial and other resources to economic and social development .  
Recognizing the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to humanitarian and natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the continuum to development ,  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .

Recommends that Governments promote the establishment of a social infrastructure in rural areas that encourages women , including poor women , to develop capacities and skills such as leadership in administrative and financial management for collective and community life , and that supports rural women 's organizations and their participation in representative and economic bodies ( for example , farmers ' organizations , workers ' unions , cooperatives and associations ) ;  
In her opening statement , the Secretary-General of the Fourth World Conference on Women stressed that the preparatory process at the national and regional levels had proceeded successfully owing to the strong involvement of Governments , international , political , financial and development organizations , the private sector , academic and research institutions , donors and , especially , non-governmental organizations .  
The subjects and emerging issues to be addressed in greater detail , both globally and for major countries and groups of countries , will include the following : output and income , macroeconomic policy-making , the world energy situation , international trade and trade policy , international transfers of financial resources and financial cooperation , and other selected social and economic issues of a more structural nature .  
Japan appreciated the role played by the High Commissioner and the Centre for Human Rights in providing advisory services and technical and financial assistance at the request of Governments and the role played by regional human rights machinery in supporting human rights activities and programmes .  
Governments at the appropriate level , with the cooperation of the relevant United Nations bodies and regional , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , the private sector and financial institutions , and taking into consideration indigenous people and their communities , as well as social and economic factors , should :  
Research to assess the comparative social , environmental and financial costs and benefits of different technologies for basic and reproductive health care within a framework of universal safety and ethical considerations ;  
To identify and strengthen or develop , as required , in particular in developing countries , the appropriate institutional , legal and financial mechanisms to ensure that water policy and its implementation are a catalyst for sustainable social progress and economic growth .  
The programme covered areas where the secretariat had established operational capacities and addressed such specific areas as export diversification and trade development , customs and trade facilitation , trade statistics , debt management , external financial flows and investments , domestic financial markets , insurance and transport , as well as the regulatory framework affecting those areas and the business environment in general .  
The Protocol was a complex and detailed document which empowered the Palestinian authority in a range of fields : imports and customs ; monetary and financial issues , including taxation ; labour mobility and social insurance ; the free movement of agricultural and industrial goods between the two sides ; insurance issues ; and tourism .  
Under meetings , seminars and workshops , most member organizations have specific plans and dates for training courses on national accounts concepts and practices and other specialized statistical systems linked with the SNA , such as balance of payments , government finance , and monetary and financial statistics , as well as interregional and regional workshops and seminars on practical implementation of the 1993 SNA .  
Strongly urges the international community to continue to provide , in a timely and effective manner , the financial , material and technical assistance necessary to enhance the individual and collective capacity of the front-line States and other neighbouring States in their efforts towards the reconstruction , rehabilitation and development of their economies ;  
Supports the treatment accorded to Nicaragua in the light of its continuing exceptional circumstances , so that the international community and financial institutions can incorporate that treatment into programmes to support the country 's economic recovery and social reconstruction ;  
As to the financial resources , the representative replied that the process of providing government aid would be a gradual one ; by gradually transforming the current educational system , primary education would become government aided , and university and other forms of tertiary education would be on a cost-sharing basis .  
Review the impact of structural adjustment programmes on social development , including , where appropriate , by means of gender sensitive social impact assessments and other relevant methods , in order to develop policies to reduce their negative effects and improve their positive impact ; the cooperation of international financial institutions in the review could be requested by interested countries ;  
Undertake to explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction in excessive military expenditures including global military expenditures and arms trade , investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development ;  
Inviting the international community , including the international financial institutions , to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development without falling into a new debt crisis ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Angola Verification Mission II until payment is effected .  
Urges the multilateral financial institutions , recipient countries and donor countries , within the conceptual framework and design and implementation of structural adjustment policies in Africa , to pay special attention to eradicating poverty and addressing the social impact of these policies , while focusing on public investment , fiscal reform , reform of public enterprises , export expansion and efficient public administration ;  
Urges the international community to increase financial resource flows to Africa , as these are crucial in order to regenerate the growth and sustainable development of the African economies , to provide effective support to the political and economic reforms in which many African countries are now engaged and to help cushion adverse social consequences ;  
At the same time , many non-governmental organizations note and are concerned that factors such as distance , limited human and financial resources , and unequal access to information are tending to distinguish between those non-governmental organizations that are closely following international processes and those , particularly in the developing world , that are not .  
Requests the Secretary-General , without further delay , to provide the Special Rapporteur with all the necessary human and financial assistance in carrying out his mandate and enabling him to submit in a timely manner an interim report to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session under the item entitled " Elimination of racism and racial discrimination " .  [ 1 ] / A / 49 / 677 , annex .  
It is suggested that macroeconomic frameworks conducive to mobilizing financial resources be developed and that the allocation of significant resources through partnership agreements and bilateral or multilateral arrangements be continued and enhanced .  
Considerable resources , both human and financial , have been devoted to the process over the past two years , in relation to support to the ad hoc secretariat , to Governments in affected countries , to the definition of the technical , scientific and political issues involved and to the formulation of the texts of the Convention and the regional annexes .  
Invites the international development agencies and organizations , including the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the United Nations Development Programme , to take account of the potential of elderly women as a human resource for development and to include older women in their development strategies and programmes , and encourages Governments to ensure the inclusion of women , regardless of age , in development projects covered by national and multilateral financial institutions ;  
Matching their institutional mandate , professional expertise and proved record with adequate financial support would have a direct measurable impact in the short and medium term .  
The three main objectives of the conference would be ( a ) to mobilize a political and economic " mountain lobby " capable of demonstrating to Governments , policy makers and planners the potential contribution of mountain areas to national and regional development ; ( b ) to introduce the financial and planning instruments needed to incorporate mountain development into national plans and budgets ; and ( c ) to examine the specific human , social and technological characteristics of mountain areas .

Although the Marriage Act had been designed to ensure equal treatment for men and women , in reality , women sometimes found themselves in difficult financial circumstances after a divorce ; that eventuality was however covered by the social security system , and if necessary it was also possible to obtain a living allowance from the municipal authority .  
In low-income countries where these aims conflict with the efforts of poor farmers to expand cultivation , special programmes with international financial and technical support will be needed to assist rural communities in developing alternative livelihoods .  
Appeals to the international community , international organizations , multilateral financial institutions , specialized agencies , organs and programmes of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations as well as all interested groups to provide developing countries , in particular African countries , with technical , medical and financial assistance commensurate with the efforts needed to control this endemic disease ;  
Also emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic recovery and growth of the world economy , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ,  
Thus , it was stated that the establishment of an international criminal court , with the subsidiary organs mentioned in article 5 and other infrastructures , would entail an enormous financial outlay which might be an extra burden for developing countries .  
The active involvement of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors should be encouraged , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , cooperatives , local community groups , women 's organizations , the media , non-governmental organizations , youth organizations , cultural groups , and financial and other for-profit organizations .  
The considerably longer labour hours of women and limited access to paid labour because of the lack of financial resources complicates the potential expansion of agricultural production even where women have traditional , and often seasonal , rights to husband 's labour for such tasks as helping to clear their individual plots .  
Stressing that , as stated in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development , held at Cairo from 5 to 13 September 1994 , [ 2 ] / family reunification of documented migrants is an important factor in international migration , and that financial remittances by documented migrants to their countries of origin often constitute a very important source of foreign exchange and are instrumental in improving the well-being of relatives left behind ,  
In addition to the financial means provided for this purpose , a number of United Nations bodies and organizations , including FAO , UNESCO , UNIDO and UNEP , have spent a considerable share of their regular programme funds on supporting programmes and activities related to science for sustainable development and scientific capacity-building in developing countries .  
In this way , countries are part of coherent synergistic international programmes and networks that not only advance knowledge in the interests of all but also utilize more efficiently scarce human and financial resources , keeping duplication to a minimum .  
Improved and innovative institutional , legal and financial arrangements relating to private sector collaboration , university-industry linkage , strategic business alliances and venture capital have been extensively developed to address the emerging issues relating to new biotechnology .  
Major constraints being experienced by the countries include , in particular , a drastic decline in financial resources to adequately maintain the various valuable scientific and technological infrastructures and , of increasing concern , the critical reduction in the scientific workforce in bioscience and biotechnology .  
Recognizing the high costs of research in biotechnology , several existing agricultural research institutes have strengthened or initiated new biotechnology programmes to address the common elements of research and development as well as the training needs of developing countries in many areas outlined under programme area E , with support from financial institutions , foundations and , to a lesser extent , the private business sector .

Requests the Secretary-General to take appropriate steps to ensure adequate financial and human resources and logistical support for the speedy deployment of a sufficient number of human rights field officers and for the delivery of programmes of technical assistance and advisory services ;  
It should be noted that , following a 1993 initiative of the World Bank , a growing number of financial institutions are meeting to discuss very practical affairs of common concern , such as procedures for assuring the environmental quality of projects and economic analysis of environmental projects .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
" that the amount of financial indebtedness resulting from non-compliance with contractual obligations of certain missions accredited to the United Nations has increased to alarming proportions " , reminded " all permanent missions to the United Nations , their personnel and Secretariat personnel of their responsibilities to meet such obligations " , and expressed " the hope that the efforts undertaken by the Committee , in consultation with all concerned , will lead to a solution of this problem " . 
The most drastic examples of abuse of the members of the Albanian national minority are placing of children in the front rows of separatist demonstrations , spreading rumour about alleged mass poisoning of Albanian children and the forcibly preventing the young generation from acquiring compulsory elementary education and other levels of education in their mother tongue for which Serbia and Yugoslavia have provided all necessary material , financial and personnel conditions .  
Other types of policies are needed for promoting economic growth and trade , changing demographic behaviour , developing human resources , alleviating poverty , promoting the transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound technology and financial resources , and managing natural resources .  
The latter 's objective is to enable people with low incomes in the Appalachian region successfully to enter the economic mainstream by , inter alia , organizing cooperative ventures among small firms to produce for niche markets , mobilizing financial resources on behalf of the region from outside , creating learning clusters in conjunction with other communities in the country , providing transitional support for people moving from welfare to work , and developing production and leadership skills .  
The possibility of reducing the huge financial , material and human resources devoted to the military sector and reallocating part of them to the civilian sector of national economies has been the object of deliberations within the framework of the United Nations for over three decades .  
At the end of the 12-month period provided in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account until payment is effected ;  
Despite the cyclical fall in contributions to multilateral institutions , developing countries ' receipts from this source were cushioned to some extent by the fact that the multilateral institutions , especially the international financial institutions , can draw on income from previous years to make their current disbursements .  
To support private pollution abatement investment , Governments in OECD countries , economies in transition and developing countries have used a wide range of policy instruments , which may be divided into three main categories : directed credit programmes , financial incentives , co-financing arrangements and venture capital funds .  
As a result , future discussions of the cross-sectoral issues of financing environmentally sound technology transfer and biotechnology should focus on the availability of external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure and fiscal incentives and the availability of resources from innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds .  
In addition to its introduction and my concluding observations , the report includes seven sections , devoted respectively to military aspects ; public security aspects ; human rights , the judicial system and the Commission on the Truth ; electoral matters ; economic and social issues ; financial aspects ; and administrative aspects .  
In her opening statement , the Secretary-General of the Fourth World Conference on Women stressed that the preparatory process at the national and regional levels had proceeded successfully owing to the strong involvement of Governments , international political , financial and development organizations , the private sector , academic and research institutions , donors and , especially , non-governmental organizations .  
Enhance the access of disadvantaged women , including women entrepreneurs , in rural , remote and urban areas to financial services through strengthening links between the formal banks and intermediary lending organizations , including legislative support , training for women and institutional strengthening for intermediary institutions with a view to mobilizing capital for those institutions and increasing the availability of credit ;  
Recommends that Governments promote the establishment of any social infrastructure in rural areas that encourages women , including poor women , to develop capacities and skills such as leadership in administrative and financial management for collective and community life , and that supports rural women 's organizations and their participation in representative and economic bodies ( for example , farmers ' organizations , workers ' unions , cooperatives and associations ) ;  
In the view of the authors , the significant international financial support anticipated by the Programme of Action has not materialized ; the science and technology policies and programmes of the United Nations system are hardly coordinated around strategic goals ; institutional and programme adjustments are inadequate and a common operational science and technology framework is absent .  
Use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting of country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to mobilize more efficiently new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .  
There was general agreement that the analytical framework presented by the matrix was illustrative , would help in integrating the application of the range of financial instruments and policy options with individual sectors and cross-sectoral activities , and could prove valuable in identifying the appropriate and most promising options , as well as their complementarity , taking into account the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities .  
Future discussions on financial aspects of environmentally sound technologies and biotechnology should consider the need for external financial resources , the adequacy of national policies with regard to creating an appropriate financial infrastructure , fiscal incentives and the potential availability of resources from innovative mechanisms , such as co-financing and venture capital funds ;  
Among such new approaches are the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , including foreign direct investment ; improved coordination and cooperation among national institutions in recipient and donor countries , on the basis of national sustainable development strategies ; partnership arrangements ; and networking between scientific institutes active in the field of sustainable development in various countries and regions .  
Work focuses on the practical problems that need to be resolved so that policies undertaken in respect of internalization do not impair the development efforts of developing countries and that they are consistent with the economic , financial , institutional , legal and social conditions of those countries .  
In the recent UNCTAD / UNEP high-level meeting on trade , environment and development , it was felt that future work on multilateral environmental agreements should focus on a more detailed empirical analysis of the use of trade measures , including conditions for the legitimate use of trade measures , the design of such measures , special circumstances of developing countries in relation to the agreements and trade policy , and the additional financial and other requirements for developing countries .  
For example , the UNCTAD Standing Committee on Commodities decided that there was considerable scope for financial and technical cooperation between developed and developing countries for improving the environmental advantages of natural products .  
Work focuses on the practical problems that need to be resolved so that policies undertaken in respect of internalization do not impair the development efforts of developing countries and are consistent with the economic , financial , institutional , legal and social conditions of those countries .

ACC noted that while issues relating to economic reforms and growth were being pursued with vigour and financial support , mainly from the Bretton Woods institutions , the pursuit of the social and environmental dimensions of development , including the protection of human rights , was lagging , owing to a lack of adequate resources and a proper appreciation of the linkages among the various dimensions of development .  
Recalling that a reappraisal of the 1921 principle , on which common system remuneration is based , was long overdue , ACC reiterated its concern that the current remuneration system was outdated and needed to be overhauled to become competitive with bilateral and other multilateral financial and aid agencies . 
While many major contributors scrupulously fulfilled their financial obligations , a considerable portion of outstanding contributions for both current and prior years was attributable to the non-payment by some major contributors .  
The structural reforms undertaken in the banking sector centred on privatizing State-owned banks , reducing barriers to entry for both domestic and foreign private banks , liberalizing the types of activities that banks could undertake and , concomitantly , improving the prudential regulation of financial institutions .  
One favourable consequence of the relative openness of the financial sector has been an acceleration of foreign private capital inflows , with the developing countries of the ESCAP region becoming the largest recipient of private capital flows among all developing countries world wide .  
In an in-house study conducted at UNU / WIDER on " Resource Mobilization and Sustainable Growth in Africa " some progress was made towards outlining a set of consistent and feasible fiscal , monetary and institutional plans to mobilize human , financial , technological and environmental resources to achieve a self-sustaining path of long-term growth .

In an era of financial stringency , the limited resources available to assist developing countries must be directed prudently towards those investments with the highest payoff ; experience in country after country demonstrates that water and sanitation improvements are vital to economic progress and , more broadly , provide the very foundations for sustainable human development .  
On the contrary , through its implementation the Government has induced financial institutions to get to know their customers better and undertake a specific and direct surveillance of transactions in order to prevent their being used as instruments for the illegal concealment , handling , investment or use of money or other goods coming not only from drug-trafficking activities but from any other kind of criminal activity .  
The subjects and emerging issues to be addressed in greater detail , both globally and for major countries and groups of countries , will include the following : output and income , macroeconomic policy-making , the world energy situation , international trade and trade policy , international transfers of financial resources and financial cooperation , and other selected social and economic issues of a more structural nature .

UNFPA will , therefore , develop a strategy for future allocations of its limited resources to help build capacities in developing countries to implement the Programme of Action , based on different levels of financial needs for multilateral assistance and the level of achievement with regard to quantitative goals of the Conference .  
The main rationale for the implementation of the Abuja Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community was that major prerequisites , including social stability , sustained economic development and social progress , could not be achieved by individual countries in isolation .  Major obstacles to regional cooperation and integration are the paucity or lack of financial resources to support the process .  
While welcoming the decision of JCGP to set a target date for this exercise , the General Assembly in resolution 47 / 199 emphasized that that process should be achieved in cooperation with host Governments in a way that increased efficiency , such as by means of the consolidation of administrative infrastructures of the organizations concerned , and with no financial increase in the cost of operations either to the United Nations system or the host developing country .

This means that the various cooperation agreements to be signed with the State institutions concerned must specify the commitments which these institutions are taking on ( political , institutional , administrative , technical , financial and legal , as the case may be ) and the specific contributions that will have to be made .  
Furthermore , the representative of DDSMS stated that the current financial situation of INSTRAW demanded that major efforts be made by the Acting Director , with the assistance of the Board members , to ensure that the level of contribution for research and training in 1995 and succeeding years be substantially increased .

Since such claims result in additional and unintended financial obligations and often indeterminate liabilities , the Board recommends that precise legal agreements to establish mutual rights and obligations should be signed with all implementing agencies .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia until payment is effected .

Given the substantial financial implications involved in the current arrangements for additional war-risk insurance , referred to in paragraph 24 ( a ) ( ii ) , alternative arrangements should be sought with the utmost expediency ;  
As always , it is the entire package of adjustment measures , plus adequate debt relief , official financial support and a buoyancy in an open world economy that builds confidence in the private sector and charges up dynamic development processes .  The external debt situation of the transition economies is thus not covered in this report .  
While welcoming the meeting held in Tombouctou on 16 and 17 July 1995 between the Government of Mali and northern Mali 's development partners , the Ministers renewed their appeal to the entire international community to increase its material and financial support for the implementation of all the provisions of the National Pact and for the consolidation of the peace process under way in the country .

Cooperation with developing States for the purposes set out in this article shall include the provision of financial assistance , assistance relating to human resources development , technical assistance , transfer of technology , including through joint venture arrangements , and advisory and consultative services .  
The credit , when extended , is short term , and when commercial banks are involved , they usually extend such trade finance only to big established customers as part of bank-customer relationships .

Most important , however , remains the need to mobilize new and additional financial resources from all potential funding sources , in particular bilateral donors and also the regional development banks , with a view to mitigating , in an effective and timely manner , the adverse impact of the sanctions regime .  
The active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors should be encouraged , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , cooperatives , local community groups , non-governmental organizations , including women 's organizations and feminist groups , the media , religious groups , youth organizations and cultural groups , as well as financial and non-profit organizations .

In this context , special emphasis should be placed on ensuring that international financial institutions make the most effective use of existing financing facilities and establish additional ones , attracting capital investments in conditions of respect for the domestic legislation of each country and using efficient energy technologies mainly to support the execution of the projects that are necessary for our region in this sector .  
The free and orderly development of financial markets should also be promoted and mechanisms developed to bring about a more stable international financial system which would ensure that increased resources are available to its institutions and that the latter would be capable of detecting , in time , potential exchange-rate and financial crises , which negate the considerable efforts being made by our countries to achieve economic reform , liberalization and stability .

The first question raises macroeconomic issues concerning domestic saving and the net transfer of foreign saving to developing countries ; the second question raises microeconomic issues concerning the role of government and the financial sector in intermediating between savers and investors .  
Policy makers in some developing countries have thus begun to focus on the disparate characteristics of different types of private financial inflows and many now question the wisdom of early and complete liberalization of the capital account in international transactions .  Meanwhile , in some of the developed countries , the prospective role of development assistance itself is being re-examined .  
Fads in policy design have repeatedly swept across segments of the community of policy advisers , only to be followed by reassessments after unanticipated difficulties have arisen .  No single model of financial development applies equally well in all institutional , cultural and technological situations .  
The Committee welcomes the financial management model of UNOPS by which administrative expenditures are planned and monitored based on a continuous review of the demand for services , as well as the actual programme delivery figures and resulting support income earned ;

NULLThe objective of this undertaking was to draw policy recommendations from an in-depth review of the existing financial systems in African countries , including the current traditional systems and practices of capital formation at the local level , with a view to improving financial systems in those countries through the adoption of practical and realistic measures focused specifically on development of the private sector . 
The formal financial system in Africa has faced a number of internal and external constraints , including inadequate technical and managerial capacity , antiquated legal and regulatory frameworks , inappropriate macroeconomic policies and pronounced government intervention , that not only hampered its growth but actually caused significant disintermediation in a number of countries .  
In the process , the intermediation mechanism grows more varied and complex , ranging from the informal financial system comprising all legal financial activities outside the orbit of institutional and officially regulated finance , to a more complex modern system , supervised by a central monetary authority , that facilitates the transfer of large quantities of money within and between countries .  
NULLThe primary stage of financial intermediation is dominated by a combination of a large informal sector where transactions between lenders and borrowers are direct and personal , a currency-creating authority ( a central bank or a currency board ) , and a limited number of deposit-receiving and credit institutions like the commercial banks .  
This stage of financial intermediation requires the satisfaction of only a few simple preconditions : the existence of a rudimentary regulatory and supervisory framework over the takers of deposits , and a minimum of institutional and technical capacity to carry out the currency-issuing and credit-extending functions , and to collect and interpret limited monetary information .  
An apparent alienation of the formal financial system from indigenous economic actors , especially in the rural areas , and in the urban informal sector and small-scale enterprises .  
Five features of these transactions are noteworthy : reciprocity ( " I help you , you help me , when in need " ) ; insignificant transaction costs ; the open-ended ( no fixed maturity ) nature of many of these financial contracts ; the informality of screening devices ( personal knowledge of borrowers ) used in making loans ; and the informal sanctions ( such as social shunning of delinquents ) employed to enforce contracts .  
NULLThe basic purpose of the proposed policy initiative would be to exploit to the maximum , and in a cost-effective manner , the savings and credit potential of the informal and semi-formal financial system ; to strengthen its ability to mobilize small savings from relatively marginal sections of population ; and to encourage decentralized lending , that is , in areas largely untouched by the formal financial system .  
They also have the potential , as demonstrated in Burkina Faso , Cameroon and Niger and a number of other African countries , to extend their reach to a larger number of depositors and borrowers , adapt the nature and size of their operations , and foster links with the formal financial system without losing their identity or forgoing their current comparative advantage over the formal system .  
NULLThe policy initiative should begin with national efforts to seek to determine the overall magnitude of operations and the role of the institutions in the informal sector , to understand how they work and how sets of unwritten rules and social conventions have guided and sustained them against risks inherent in financial transactions .  
The content and complexity of these regulations must be appropriate to the existing degree of financial intermediation , neither so restrictive as to prevent competition and development of innovative institutions or practices , nor so permissive as to allow the establishment and operation of shadowy and shaky financial institutions .  
Similarity of regulatory and prudential framework may also be desirable , however , even for countries not forming part of a common monetary area , in order to avoid " competitive " inducements for the entry of foreign banks , as well as to permit a greater intercountry / interbank flow of funds conducive to the emergence of geographically wider financial markets in Africa .  
For this purpose , the central bank should promote the establishment , on a volunteer basis , of a critical mass of primary dealers who must satisfy certain minimum criteria ( such as observing minimum capital standards ) to possess the financial capacity to support the government securities market , and encourage competition .  
In the interests of promoting regional integration and the emergence of wider financial markets in Africa , as well as to avoid costly " competitive " inducements to foreign entry , it is also desirable that countries adopt similar regulatory and prudential frameworks ;  
NULLPursuant to General Assembly resolution 36 / 151 , voluntary contributions to the Fund from Governments , non-governmental organizations and private individuals are to be distributed through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been severely violated as a result of torture and to relatives of such victims .  
NULLCooperation with developing States for the purposes set out in this article shall include the provision of financial assistance , assistance relating to human resources development , technical assistance , transfer of technology , including through joint venture arrangements , and advisory and consultative services .  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
The implementation of a sound macroeconomic policy framework is seen as a key determinant of future financial stability and rapid economic recovery .  
As such , the programme has been unable to provide any substantial financial assistance to meet capital assistance needs which have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries which are committed to these ends but which face economic hardship due to economic problems , crisis or transition .  
Such support might be facilitated by , inter alia , the substantial supplementing of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation in the Field of Human Rights ; the establishment of a separate , complementary fund for capital assistance in the field of human rights ; or encouraging increased support from development agencies and funds and financial institutions for financial and capital assistance for human rights and the rule of law .  
NULLWe recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society .  
Technical and financial cooperation is still needed from the international community , however , failing which there is little likelihood of consolidation of economic growth , reconstruction , improved living conditions for the poorest sectors of the population , peace , democracy and the functioning of democratic institutions .  
I am convinced that , notwithstanding the acute financial crisis currently facing the Organization , the provision of additional resources to UNOMIL , at a level that is modest by comparison with peace-keeping operations elsewhere , is justified by the hope that the Abuja Agreement at last offers a chance of ending the cruel war in Liberia and alleviating the terrible suffering it has caused .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
The seven major industrialized countries and other international monetary and financial organizations had allocated nearly US $ 4-billion in support of Ukraine 's efforts ; however , total foreign investment needs were calculated at close to US $ 40-billion .  
Besides , foreign markets have been lost , the domestic market has contracted , capital and other foreign financial transactions have been interrupted , the economy has been decapitalized and the country is devoid of resources for simple reproduction , let alone for development investment .  
The agenda for development should underscore the anachronistic nature of the current international economic and financial system which , each year , deprived developing countries of over $ 500-billion in economic opportunities due to restrictions or unequal access to world trade , labour and capital markets and " allowed " a net transfer of resources of $ 50-billion from the poor countries to the wealthy countries .  
The tendency for the Bretton Woods institutions to become increasingly involved in direct economic management in the developing countries , instead of playing a role of global governance was cause for great concern , particularly since they were often incapable of redressing the imbalances in world monetary and financial markets , which usually operated against weak economies .  
Governments in such regions can do much to remedy intrinsic factors that contribute to that unattractiveness but they will need more help to enable them to meet the financial requirements of sustainable development , for which genuine new and innovative sources will be required , including sources in the developed world .  
International legal and related efforts in the field of environment continue to see rapid development , constituting a substantial framework of legal , administrative , economic , financial and technical measures to prevent , control and reduce the adverse impact of human activities on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems .  
In addition , the Commission requested the Executive Secretary of ECA and the Director-General of UNIDO to hold consultative meetings of sponsoring countries and organizations with indigenous and external potential investors as well as African and non-African financial institutions , for the purpose of identifying , formulating and undertaking feasibility studies and financing of specific bankable projects with basic industries .  
Of particular significance among these are the facilitation of technical and financial support for developing country parties , as required by the Convention and called for by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 195 , as well as the role played by the secretariat in coordinating the in-depth reviews of the national communications received from annex I parties .  
In addition , foreign markets have been lost , the domestic market has contracted , capital and other foreign financial transactions have been interrupted , the economy has been decapitalized and the country is devoid of resources for simple production , let alone for development investment .  
Emphasizes the need to broaden appropriate cooperation among monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to encourage the establishment of preventive consultations between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
Expressing also its concern that serious external and domestic financial constraints have been experienced by developing countries that have continued to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion ,  
Also stresses the urgent need for creditor countries , private banks and lending institutions to expand their efforts to address the commercial debt of debt-distressed developing countries , and to extend appropriate new financial support , as well as provide additional and innovative measures , to enable these countries to achieve sustained economic growth and development ;  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
Supports the treatment accorded to Nicaragua in the light of its continuing exceptional circumstances , so that the international community and financial institutions can incorporate that treatment into programmes to support the country 's economic recovery and social reconstruction ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand fund-raising channels , to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries to enable them to implement their national workplans and projects , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malaria vaccines as a priority ;  
Recalling the commitments made by the developed countries in various international conferences and summits held during the 1990s to provide adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ,  
Noting that the peace dividend has not materialized in the form of additional financial flows to developing countries , and expressing the need for the reallocation by developed countries of resources freed from military purposes arising from the end of the Cold War towards productive development purposes in support of existing international commitments for development ,  
For their part , Member States will pursue and take responsibility for reforming that system .  NULLWe recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society .  
Given current financial constraints and the fact that a limited number of persons had access to the seminars organized under the Programme , audiovisual tapes on various subjects of international law were a convenient tool to place at the disposal of educational institutions of States , especially developing States .  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
As demonstrated by the preparatory process , the implementation of innovative approaches for strengthening institutions and capacity-building do not necessarily require new institutional arrangements , but rather a reorientation of largely existing human , technical and financial resources within a coherent and internally consistent framework .  
Also emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic recovery and growth of the world economy , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities such as triangular funding arrangements and private sector funding ;  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 and 49 / 9 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
To be consistent with the Assembly 's responsibility for financial matters , procedures were established for the proper authorization of such unforeseen and extraordinary expenses ; this took the form of an annual , and later biennial , resolution adopted by the Assembly on unforeseen and extraordinary expenses .  
all national and international policies and measures , in particular those of an economic and financial character , should be judged in this light and accepted only in so far as they may be held to promote and not to hinder the achievement of this fundamental objective " .  
These obstacles must be analysed in the context of international political and economic relations characterized by the globalization of the economy and in a specific historical context marked by the end of the cold war and East-West confrontation , the emergence of regional economic groupings and the concentration of economic , financial and technological power in the hands of a limited number of countries .  
As part of the reforms which should , in the experts ' view , be introduced to improve the international economic environment , reference was made to the urgent need to reform the international monetary system in order to correct current distortions and discourage speculative financial transactions .  
Emphasizing the importance of cooperation and international solidarity in supporting the efforts being made by the peoples and Governments of Central America for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace , and the need to strengthen the new programme of cooperation and economic , technical and financial assistance for Central America in the light of the new situation in the region ,  
Supports the treatment accorded to Nicaragua in the light of its continuing exceptional circumstances , so that the international community and financial institutions can incorporate that treatment into programmes to support the country 's economic recovery and social reconstruction ;  
Thus , according to the fund type and the type of transaction being processed , the system reviews a number of parameters , selects those that are applicable and is then able to choose the correct posting rule to be applied after the financial document is approved or amended , i.e . , the accounting entries are automatically recorded in the accounting ledger tables .  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America ;  
In the light of the improving situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and of the critical financial situation of the United Nations , I have accepted the recommendations of my Special Representative and the Force Commander that only essential forces should be retained to implement UNPROFOR 's mandate pending a transition to other arrangements . 
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Recommendation 1 : Wherever United Nations system organizations desire to enhance cooperative relationships with the multilateral financial institutions , their executive heads and the governing bodies responsible for operational activities for development should make a meaningful commitment to increase the competitiveness of their programmes .  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation , and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
As mentioned in the paragraph on the status of Iraq contained in its report to the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , 1 / the Committee on Contributions stated that some of its members were of the opinion that the waiver of Article 19 for Iraq should be recommended , whereas other members were of the view that the Committee did not have adequate statistical information on the current economic and financial situation of Iraq .  
We recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society . 
The assignment of additional resources to a number of priority areas ( political affairs , international and regional cooperation for development , human rights , humanitarian affairs and internal monitoring ) was an important practical step , because the focusing of resources should make it easier to achieve the targets which had been set , while taking account of the financial situation of the United Nations .  
In that connection , the incapacity of the newly independent States which had emerged from the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to discharge their financial obligations was attributable not only to their extremely difficult social and economic situation , but above all to the fact that the rates of assessment recommended by the Committee on Contributions in 1992 were unfair and excessive compared with their real capacity to pay .  
He stressed the need to reach a consensus on a fair and equitable apportionment of the expenses of the Organization and reiterated that the real capacity of Member States to pay was the fundamental criterion for determining a scale which would be acceptable to all and would help to strengthen the financial basis of the Organization and of the United Nations system .  
At the end of the 12-month period provided in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates will be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable will remain recorded in the Special Account until payment is effected ;  
The Heads of State and delegations considered it imperative that the search for peace in the Great Lakes region should be accompanied by coordinated and concrete actions by the international community to mobilize financial resources so as to bring economic and social development to the region .  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Whether it was decided to set up a trust fund , to have recourse to the existing international financial institutions , to non-governmental organizations or to bilateral assistance , the key point was to agree on specific measures making it possible to assist States affected by the sanctions .  
the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
that the international community should continue to give strong support to the efforts of the developing countries to solve their grave economic and social problems as well as to promote a favourable climate for private financial flows through the creation of a favourable international economic environment ,  
concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
We recognize that our common work will be the more successful if it is supported by all concerned actors of the international community , including non-governmental organizations , multilateral financial institutions , regional organizations and all actors of civil society . 
stressed the need for strengthened international cooperation which should be reflected in appropriate financial and technological resources to enable developing countries to implement their national plans .  
tendency to impose unrealistic standards and requirements on the industries and products of developing countries and to propose or adopt financial policies which were detrimental to those countries ' economic and social development , under the pretext of environmental protection , was therefore inconsistent with the spirit and provisions of environmental agreements , including the Framework Convention on Climate Change .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
the imbalance between the increasing responsibilities that the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council had given that Branch and the institutional and financial means at its disposal could not be ignored , especially in the light of the growing crime rate , which was directly related to the tremendous corrupting power and the increasingly sophisticated methods of criminal organizations .  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America ;  
also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation , and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to increase its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand fund-raising channels , to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries to enable them to implement their national work plans and projects , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malaria vaccines as a priority ;  
outbreak of hostilities in 1991 interrupted critical administrative and financial reforms within the Croatian Ministry of Health as it sought to end chronic financial deficits and increase efficiency by shifting resources from curative and secondary clinical care to primary and preventive services .  
There is a heavy financial burden on the Government of Croatia to meet capital requirements in order to strengthen its infrastructure , as its current military-industrial complex is absorbing existing capital , thus preventing the investment necessary to achieve reconstruction and the restoration of infrastructure and other services . 
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;

Urgently appeals to all States , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue to provide , on a priority basis and as far as conditions on the ground permit , all possible financial , technical and material assistance for the restoration of the basic services and the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the voluntary , safe and secure return of refugees and internally displaced persons , and appeals to the international financial and development institutions to assist in the planning of the reconstruction of Afghanistan ;  
All those activities required financial support on an orderly , stable and predictable basis , and it was therefore critical that donor countries demonstrate the political commitment to provide the funds promised and thereby to reach the objectives established during the triennial review . 
the geographic coverage of operational activities had been extended to the CIS countries and their scope now also included administrative reform , the defence of human rights and elections , and financial resources therefore should have been increased accordingly .  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand fund-raising channels , to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries to enable them to implement their national work plans and projects , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malaria vaccines as a priority ;

At a meeting of ACC held the previous month in New York , all the Executive Heads of the organizations of the United Nations system had expressed deep awareness of the need for improved performance management and increased productivity at a time of increasing demands and scarce financial resources .  
emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic recovery and growth of the world economy , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,

Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
achievement of sustainable solutions required national , regional and international solidarity , which meant that financial and human resources exceeding the capacity of a single country or small group of countries had to be mobilized .  
part of the enhancement of " the capacity of the Organization and of the United Nations system to support the ongoing follow-up to the Conference in the most integrated and effective way , including human and financial requirements " ( para . 32 ) , the Secretary-General is requested to ensure the more effective functioning of the Division for the Advancement of Women in order to carry out all the tasks foreseen for it in the Platform for Action by , inter alia , providing sufficient human and financial resources within the regular budget of the United Nations .

Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;

Also decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 2,618,600 dollars gross ( 2,217,800 dollars net ) for the period from 1 October 1994 to 30 June 1995 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,966,500 United States dollars gross ( 1,858,600 dollars net ) , for the period from 14 January to 15 May 1995 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 378,600 United States dollars gross ( 373,800 dollars net ) for the period from 16 December 1994 to 16 June 1995 ;  
Renews its appeal to all Governments , especially the Governments of developed countries and other Governments in a position to do so , as well as to international and regional financial institutions , to make substantial contributions to the voluntary fund established by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 180 for the purpose of financing preparatory activities for the Conference and supporting developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , in participating fully and effectively in the Conference and its preparatory process ;  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
than ever before it was necessary to observe the essence of " partnership " and " interdependence " in international relations with a view to providing substantial support to structural adjustment programmes in the least developed countries on terms adapted to their needs , as well as additional financial assistance to enable them to alleviate poverty , protect the environment and carry out social programmes .  
that had to be complemented by action aimed at improving the terms of trade for the least developed countries , channelling foreign direct investment in a meaningful way and providing financial and technical assistance to develop human resources and build economic and social institutions .  
Requests the Government of Burundi to continue its efforts geared towards the achievement of national reconciliation and the lasting maintenance of peace , inter alia , through adherence to the principles of the Convention on Governance , provisions that are essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of humanitarian aid and economic , financial , material and technical assistance to the people of Burundi ;  
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to continue its efforts to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
downward trend recorded over the last three budgets and the absence of links between financial commitments and programming had aroused concerns and led to questioning as to whether environmental concerns had been recognized as having equal importance with social and economic concerns .  The Governing Council had again called on all Governments to contribute voluntarily to the Environment Fund in time to permit implementation of the planned activities .  
With respect to the recommendation of the Advisory Committee that the conversion of some temporary posts to permanent posts should be deferred , he said it was difficult to demand a high level of efficiency from the Centre when significant new mandates had been assigned to it without commensurate human and financial resources .  
considered that the main cause of the serious financial situation of the United Nations , which required a global and balanced solution , was the fact that certain Member States lacked the political will to discharge the binding financial obligations which they had assumed upon subscribing to the Charter .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Suspiciously enough , these events come together at one point : the passing by the United States Congress of the infamous piece of legislation aimed at definitively blockading Cuba from the rest of the world , when over 35 years of a cruel and ever-worsening economic , commercial and financial blockade have failed and has been condemned year after year by this sovereign Assembly .  
The 1990s have been a decade of political and economic upheaval throughout the world , and there has been an increasing tendency towards democratization and the participation of non-governmental actors in development , with a particularly strong emphasis on the need for good governance and for sound financial and economic policies at the national level and a greater reliance on market forces and on the private sector as basic requirements of development .  
Specific requirements should be identified for bilateral and multilateral cooperation in capacity-building and the training of civil servants in the areas of economic and financial management , the creation of jobs , the eradication of poverty , the provision of adequate criminal justice infrastructures and environmental protection .  
However , if and when the financial target of the 20 / 20 initiative is attained , and even if more donors reach or surpass the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance , as the Netherlands did long ago , it will only have the hoped-for effect if there is a sufficiently competent and honest government machinery to administer these important funds .  
The State was typical of the nineteenth century : a judge and gendarme liberal State assuming the essential duties of national defence , internal security , foreign relations , basic financial activity and justice .  
Regarding public finance , we strengthened the financial institutions for State financial programming and introduced new budgetary norms to secure investments in projects that are duly formulated and coordinated by our central planning body .  
Streamlining governmental machinery , increasing its productivity and reducing costs , improving economic and financial management , promoting the interaction between the private and public sectors , and stimulating the participation of the various actors in this process have been at the forefront of recent efforts for public administration reforms in Austria .  
The International Tribunal set up to identify agents of genocide living abroad has not been effective , as it has been crippled by organizational , financial and operational obstacles .  
At the same time , it is necessary to recognize what the Secretary General 's report points out : that the challenges which Governments worldwide face in establishing a framework of public administration and a financial system for sustainable economic development are not just domestic influences , but are also unpredictable external factors .  
In addition to paying tribute to the people of Haiti in its ongoing search for a strong and lasting democracy , justice and economic prosperity , the General Assembly reaffirms the international community 's commitment to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti , with a view to supporting social and economic development efforts and to strengthening Haitian institutions that must administer justice and ensure democracy , the observance of human rights , political stability and economic development .  
The view was expressed that , for financial reasons and in the interest of improved efficiency and effectiveness , subsidiary bodies that had been granted an exception to meet away from their established headquarters should be invited to review their need for the exception in the light of the current situation of their work .  
The desire of a number of countries , including the Russian Federation ( which as a result of the imposition of sanctions has suffered and continues to suffer very substantial material and financial losses ) to elaborate practical ways and means to prevent the negative consequences of sanctions or , at least , to keep them to a minimum , are therefore fully justified .  
He also drew attention to some remaining difficulties such as the possible additional resources that Conference Services would need for the editing , translation and printing of the supplement , the heavy burden that the concentration of the review work within a single division would place on that division and the priority to be given to other urgent responsibilities in the current period of financial crisis and diminishing resources .  
The main objective of the review was to obtain assurance that the assumptions used in the programme budget were based on sound financial and economic principles and to suggest refinements in budgetary techniques and modifications in format with a view to achieving realistic and transparent budgetary proposals .  
Funds received or pledges recorded as receivable , attributable to future financial periods and , therefore , not credited to the income account of the period reported on .  
As a result of our examination , we are of the opinion that the financial statements present fairly the financial position of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research as at 31 December 1995 and the results of its operations for the year then ended ; that they were prepared in accordance with the stated accounting policies which were applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding financial period , and that the transactions were in accordance with the Financial Regulations and the relevant legislative authority .  
It added that apart from the total amount of financial contributions to the Habitat II process arising directly and indirectly from the contractor 's activities , the valuable contributions of the firm to the overall preparations and success of Habitat II , including its role in raising awareness about the Conference among prominent and influential circles of a Member State , had been substantial .  
Our Organization , which was designed to respond to both global challenges and to the needs of its Member States , will not be able to play its double role in the coming century unless it can count on a sound , solid and stable financial basis .  
With its financial resources and groups of experts , the United Nations system can assist the countries of the South to overcome their disadvantaged position and succeed in their efforts for timely regional and global integration , in the context of an economic , trade , scientific and technological race on a global scale .  
A number of societies are seriously threatened by increasing external debt , the instability of the international financial system , persistent unemployment , intractable poverty and increasingly destructive waves of crime and corruption .  
There should also be a significant increase in transfers of long-term development finance to developing countries by , first , attaining the existing official development assistance target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product by mobilizing new and additional sources of finance ; secondly , creating a global fund by mobilizing resources using new and innovative measures , such as the Tobin tax and environment-related levies from which Governments in both the North and the South would benefit ; and , thirdly , introducing measures to stabilize the international monetary system and financial markets .  
Furthermore , these leaders unanimously called for in-depth reflection so that we might enter the twenty-first century with a restructured , reinvigorated Organization , equipped with the necessary human , material and financial resources to more effectively accomplish the lofty mission of an Organization that harmonizes the complementary efforts of Member States in order to achieve new goals in a context of freedom and active solidarity . 
In spite of the importance of the administrative and financial reform of the United Nations , its specialized agencies and other organs , the influential Powers have not given the question of collective security adequate attention with a view to developing ways and means to preserve international peace and security .  
It is difficult to persevere in the face of harsh and unjustified criticism and insufficient financial resources while engaged in the complex task of revitalizing the United Nations to meet the needs of a world in rapid transformation .  
Despite this difficult situation , Zaire has made it a point of honour to pursue its democratic process , committing itself to reestablishing the authority of the State , rebuilding the basic infrastructure , improving the country 's economic , financial and monetary situation , ensuring the security of persons and property and observing human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
We need to enforce existing international instruments , promote cooperation and allow the United Nations to play a more central and coordinating role in developing appropriate machinery for bringing together political will and financial and technological resources to guarantee results .  
The dynamic and extraordinary manner in which Mr . Boutros Boutros-Ghali has accomplished his mission as Secretary-General in difficult circumstances of financial constraints and wars within and among Nations , and his fostering of social and economic development , has earned our sincere gratitude .  
We wish to stress the urgent need for the international community , particularly donor countries and international financial institutions , to adopt an effective , comprehensive and equitable development-oriented and durable solution to the debt problem of developing countries .  
To complement these efforts , we make a special appeal to the international community , and particularly to the multilateral financial institutions , to adopt concrete measures to effect a drastic reduction of external indebtedness of least developed countries and other severely indebted developing countries .  
While it may be true that the existing financial crisis is primarily a crisis of payment , there is no denying the fact that there is unnecessary waste being generated here , whether in regard to the duplication of work detail , the excessive copying of documents , the scheduling of numerous meetings destined to accomplish nothing or to a myriad of other undesirables .  
A vast programme was set up in the economic and financial sphere that included financial stabilization measures , a State audit , monitoring of civil servants and a recovery of State movable property and real estate .  
That programme , which is supported by the international financial institutions with which we have worked out clear-cut modalities for negotiation and cooperation , will enable us better to meet an economic and social future that will be more promising and that will better favour the integration of the Haitian economy into the world scene .  
The efforts of the organs of the United Nations system engaged in providing technical and advisory assistance to the least developed countries , particularly the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) , need to be supplemented adequately by the Bretton Woods institutions and regional financial institutions to arrest and reverse the declining economic and social situation of the least developed countries .  
Negative economic growth rates , persistent imbalances in the commercial and financial fields , increased transitional or structural unemployment , and an absence of coordination in exchange rates and trade policies these are some of the problems connected with the system of the developed world which have an adverse impact on the developing countries .  
However , that is not because , apart from current financial constraints , the Organization has not allocated millions of dollars to peacekeeping operations ; it is because it has not come to grips with the real causes of conflicts , and because artificial solutions have so often been imposed which , far from fostering a negotiated and objective settlement of conflicts , have been dictated by hegemonic interests . 
The Group is pleased that the Commission adopted a resolution that called for the implementation of agreed measures to eradicate poverty and for strengthened international cooperation to that end , and which also called on the international community to mobilize additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable to contribute to poverty eradication .  
We in Japan believe that such genuine development can only be achieved on the basis of a comprehensive approach to development which would involve activities ranging over the economic and social fields , such as financial resource mobilization through official development assistance , investment and trade , and human resource mobilization through social integration of people by means of ensuring basic education , primary health care and empowerment of all groups of people in society .  
Also proclaimed is the critical importance of the cooperation , support and contributions of the international community , the United Nations , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society including private citizens for social development .  
Thus while it acknowledged that individual countries bear the primary responsibility for the attainment of the goals of the conference , it also recognized that the support of the international community as a whole including of the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , bilateral donors , non-governmental organizations and all actors of civil society will be crucial if we are to realize all the objectives of the conference .  
We may recall that , although the Social Summit acknowledged that the primary responsibility to attain the goals set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action rests with national Governments , it also emphasized the importance of support and contributions from the international community , the United Nations and multilateral financial institutions .  
On the home front , supporting the private and informal sectors , promotion of self-employment , provision of credit facilities to the unemployed , encouraging the creation of volunteer organizations including grass-roots financial organizations , investment in training and education programmes , optimal use of resources such as land and water , expansion of labour-intensive economic activities and a focus on the service sector are among the necessary first steps .  
The European Union has taken a leading role in the strengthening of regulatory regimes , including in the establishment of the nuclear safety account , administered by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , the G 24 coordinating mechanism , the European Union 's Poland-Hungary Aid for the Reconstruction of the Economy ( PHARE ) and Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States ( TACIS ) programmes , the European Atomic Energy Community loan facility , coordinated support from the international financial institutions for the energy sector , and bilateral cooperation projects .  
Kuwait believes that there are several countries that have proven , through their relations with the United Nations , that they are capable of assuming the main responsibilities of maintaining international peace and security and of assisting in achieving the United Nations objectives in the political , economic , social and cultural fields through their participation in peacekeeping operations and their considerable financial contributions to the various budgets of these operations and to the regular United Nations budget .  
The Government of Benin keenly hopes to benefit further from the assistance and support of the entire international community , the United Nations system , multilateral financial institutions , non-governmental organizations and all the other elements of civil society throughout the world in order to conclude successfully its programme of building a State truly based on the rule of law and a prosperous nation in which all the citizens of Benin will soon share a minimum level of well-being .  
In an international environment characterized by the exacerbation of commercial , financial and cultural competition , in which international aid is becoming scarcer , strengthening the endogenous capacities of Africa is a healthy imperative to allow our continent to take its destiny into its own hands .  
The full economic and social utilization of those resources for the benefit of the peoples , to uplift them and create and maintain a better way of life , has been retarded by the severe impact of external debt and , concomitantly , debt-servicing costs , declining levels of official development assistance , reduced financial flows for investment and for industrial , business and commercial development , increasing barriers to trade and impaired access to the markets of the developed countries of the world .  
Despite their commitment to sustained economic reforms , African countries ' experiences have been far from pleasant in terms of economic growth because of the increasing trend towards globalization of the world economy , the unfavourable external environment , poor access to the external market , declining returns on their commodities , and the unpredictability of the financial system .  
It has been acknowledged by the United Nations , by the specialized agencies and by the entire international community as a whole as exceptional in terms of urgencies and opportunities , which calls for an exceptional mobilization of political will , and of human , technological and financial resources in order to speed up implementation of the New Agenda for the remainder of the decade and beyond , in later years , in line with the draft resolution recommended in section IV of document A / 51 / 48 .  
Mwakawago ( United Republic of Tanzania ) : First of all , I would like to express my delegation 's appreciation for the Secretary-General 's report , contained in document A / 51 / 355 dated 13 September 1996 , concerning agenda item 27 , entitled Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
Grave concerns have been expressed that despite the worldwide call for an end to the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba , this embargo not only continues but has been further strengthened and extended since the Helms-Burton Act was promulgated in March this year .  
Seemingly intractable , age-old problems have witnessed dramatic developments , stability and economic development .  As my Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated , the Government of Angola is profoundly concerned by the difficult social and economic situation prevailing in the Republic of Cuba as a result of the financial and economic blockade imposed on that member of the General Assembly .  
We have worked together in political , economic , commercial , financial , scientific , technical , educational and cultural areas .  
It should be unconscionable that financial flows to Africa remain so low despite renewed commitments by the international community to the contrary , and even more so when the majority of African countries have undertaken difficult and unpopular structural adjustment programmes that have marginalized the poor further , depleted natural resources and degraded the environment .  
The international community should therefore lend , as before , moral and methodological support , as well as economic , financial and other assistance which would allow the Governments of new or restored democracies to proceed with bold steps to create a thriving market economy and a democratic system and to alleviate the social costs sustained in the process .  
The draft resolution also reaffirms the continuing need for practical measures to mitigate the negative impact of the sanctions on the affected States by supporting their financial stabilization , developing the transport and communications infrastructure , promoting trade and increasing their active involvement in the post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation of the region .  
We support the conclusion contained in this report that new and additional financial resources from all potential funding sources , especially at the bilateral and regional levels , are necessary to address a variety of persisting economic problems of the affected States , in particular the long-term effects of sanctions on their economies .  
We should study that document in depth in order to determine the extent to which the mandates established by Member States have been carried out and to enable Member States to establish common priorities in the context of the major political , economic , social administrative and financial issues on the agenda of the Organization .  
In strengthening and modernizing the United Nations , the emphasis has to be on enhancing legitimacy , addressing inequities in decision-making processes and promoting efficiency and effectiveness better to meet the changing , complex needs of Members . The ultimate objective of reform can not be reduced to cutting costs or just addressing the current financial crisis .  
The General Assembly also called on developed countries to refrain from threats to impose commercial and financial restrictions , blockades , embargoes , and other economic sanctions on developing countries , because such practices violate the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and international bilateral and multilateral commitments .  
It is precisely because of our recognition of the specific and peculiar problems faced by the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories , most of which are small island Territories that suffer from impediments created by the interplay of such factors as economic and geographic size , isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters , lack of technological and financial resources and so on , including problems of accessibility to international credit and markets , that the international community should give specific priority and attention to the process of decolonization affecting the peoples of those Territories .  
The draft resolution before the Assembly recognizes the increasing need for humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development .  
The suffering they inflict upon civilian populations , their detrimental effects on economic and social development , especially in areas infested with landmines , and the hefty financial burdens , as well as the technological limitations involved in their detection and de-activation , are undeniable . 
The presentation of Uruguay 's initial report ( CRC / C / 3 / Add . 37 ) at the latest session of the Committee on the Rights of the Child had provided an opportunity for a constructive dialogue which had demonstrated the priority now accorded to children by the Government of Uruguay in its political programme to promote public and private activities carried out with the financial aid of the international community . 
Requests improved annual reporting on financial flows , including allocations / expenditures , based on consistent criteria and related to the costed elements of the Programme of Action , including a clear account of levels and trends of funding by source ( bilateral , multilateral ( both core and non-core ) and private funds , domestic allocations and the like ) ;  
Urges Governments to promote and attain the goals of eradicating illiteracy , universal and equitable access to quality education , and the highest standard of physical and mental health , and to encourage international organizations , in particular the international financial institutions , to support these objectives and to integrate them into policy programmes and operations , as appropriate ;  
Calls upon the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including , as mutually agreed , on concessional and grant terms ;  
Invites all relevant specialized agencies , funds , programmes and related organizations of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , to strengthen and adjust their activities , programmes and strategies , as appropriate , with a view to achieving the overall goal of eradicating poverty , meeting the basic human needs of all and promoting self-reliance and community-based initiatives , through , inter alia , financial and technical support to developing countries in their efforts to translate all measures , recommendations and commitments into operational and concrete programmes , projects and activities ;  
Also calls upon the international community to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including ( , as mutually agreed , ) on concessional and grant terms ;  
Additional financial resources obtained through established means - including increased and dependable official development assistance ( ODA ) , better mobilization of domestic resources and greater foreign direct investment - are called for .  
The Council acknowledged the need to facilitate access for developing countries to energy-efficient technologies and research , and called upon the international community , including developed countries , to make technologies and financial resources available to the developing countries to enable them to fully develop their potential capability in the field of new and renewable sources of energy , including their vast hydropower resources .  
Therefore , paragraph 4 of the draft resolution stated that the General Assembly noted with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General on the problem of indebtedness , stressed that non-payment of undisputed debts reflected badly on the entire diplomatic community , reaffirmed that non-compliance with contractual obligations could not be justified or condoned , and endorsed the proposals and procedures on the issue of financial indebtedness set out in annex II to the current report of the Committee .  
Many countries reported that they had established national TCDC focal points , but that their activities were constrained owing to insufficient staff , financial resources , coordination within the Government and understanding of TCDC .  
The idea of triangular funding , by which the financial resources of developed countries could be used to acquire the appropriate technical resources of developing countries in order to meet the needs of other developing countries , received universal endorsement from all delegations .  
Stressing the importance of chapter VI of annex II to the report of the Beijing Conference , he said that it was essential that adequate financial resources should be made available at the international level , particularly for small island developing States which had only limited economic capacities , for the implementation of the Platform for Action . 
Requests , therefore , that the Secretary-General ensure that the outcomes of major United Nations conferences are disseminated as widely as possible and also to ensure that the documents related to the Year and the Decade , once adopted , are transmitted to all States , relevant international and regional organizations , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks in order to secure their active and substantial contributions ;  
To achieve that objective , financial , technical and material support must be extended to those developing countries which lacked resources , especially African countries like Kenya , as well as to those United Nations bodies which were directly concerned with human rights questions .  
RIESCO ( Director of Conference Services ) , reporting on the technical and financial implications of the proposal by the representative of the Netherlands that the Committee should rationalize its work by scheduling four two-hour meetings daily , beginning at 9 a.m . , 11 a.m . , 2 p.m . and 4 p.m . , said that , while the Secretariat would be ready to provide conference services to accommodate whatever schedule would be most productive for the Committee 's work , the proposal raised a number of issues relating to the efficient use of resources .  
Notes with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General on the problem of diplomatic indebtedness , [ 4 ] stresses that such indebtedness is a matter of significant concern to the United Nations and that non-payment of undisputed debts reflects badly on the entire diplomatic community and tarnishes the image of the Organization itself , reaffirms that non-compliance with contractual obligations can not be condoned or justified , and endorses the proposals and procedures on the issue of financial indebtedness set out in annex II to the current report of the Committee ;  
It was in the best interests of all States to support genuine efforts devoid of any hidden political interest and to that end , to enter into a frank dialogue and to emphasize crisis prevention rather than simply reacting to human rights violations which usually accompanied crises .  It was in that spirit that his delegation supported the appeal for new human and financial resources launched by the High Commissioner for Human Rights .  
Renews its appeal to all Governments , especially the Governments of developed countries and other Governments in a position to do so , as well as to international and regional financial institutions , to make substantial contributions to the voluntary fund established by the General Assembly in its resolution 47 / 180 for the purpose of financing preparatory activities for the Conference and supporting developing countries , in particular the least developed among them , in participating fully and effectively in the Conference and its preparatory process ;  
Stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Recognizing that the international community should continue to give strong support to the efforts of the developing countries to solve their grave economic and social problems as well as to promote a favourable climate for private financial flows through the creation of a favourable international economic environment ,  
Expressing concern also that a significant number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets ,  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
recognizes the need for a stronger and central role for the Fund in surveillance of all countries , in a symmetrical manner , in accordance with paragraph 4 of the communiqu of the Interim Committee of the Board of Governors of the Fund , dated 26 April 1995 , with regard to potential sources of destabilization of capital markets with a view to promoting transparency and stability in international financial markets and promoting economic growth , such surveillance including , among other elements , the regular and timely provision of economic and financial data ;  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Invites creditor countries , private banks and multilateral financial institutions , within their prerogatives , to consider continuing the initiatives and efforts to address the commercial debt problems of the least developed countries and the requests for continued mobilization of resources through the Debt-reduction Facility of the International Development Association in order to help eligible least developed countries reduce their commercial debt ;  
Further stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Emphasizes the continuing need for technical and financial assistance from the United Nations system and from bilateral and multilateral sources to complement the efforts of African countries in achieving the objectives of the Second Decade , as well as the need for African countries to enhance cooperation among themselves in the areas of industrial policy , institutional development , human resources development , technology and investments ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
The Conference will consider relevant national and international policies and strategies that are needed to enable developing countries to take full advantage of the opportunities for growth and development offered by the new global context while minimizing the risks of new imbalances and instabilities , including in international financial markets , and the potential marginalization of the least developed countries and other weaker economies .  
While some delegations believed that financial liberalization had led to an increase of speculative capital movements , others saw inadequate economic policies and poor fundamentals as the main culprit , in particular excessive creation of domestic credit , loose fiscal policies and insufficient domestic savings .  
The Conference will consider relevant national and international policies and strategies that are needed to enable developing countries to take full advantage of the opportunities for growth and development offered by the new global context while minimizing the risks of new imbalances and instabilities , including in international financial markets , and the potential marginalization of the least developed countries and other weaker economies . 
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Currently , the health of women in Rwanda was extremely vulnerable due to lack of medical infrastructure , supplies and personnel , limited financial resources , lack of access to health care , malnutrition , unsafe drinking-water , and the spread of HIV / AIDS . Women were more susceptible to diseases than men because they were overworked , had unplanned pregnancies , were malnourished during pregnancy and suffered complications from childbirth . 
My delegation believes the report provides us with important information regarding the political , military , humanitarian , financial , economic and social aspects of the situation in Angola , which , in our opinion , will prove invaluable to our discussion concerning the future of UNAVEM III .  
The Conference noted that the participation of scientists , researchers and educators from developing countries in international projects , as well as in international scientific information exchange , was extremely limited not only due to insufficient resources ( both financial and human ) , but also because of inadequate access to scientific and technical information .  
To enable timely procurement of essential goods and services required for new missions and the maintenance of ongoing missions , and in order for the Controller to exercise the authority granted under financial rule 110.6 ( Commitments against the appropriations of current and future financial periods ) , relevant criteria , restrictions and new procedures were introduced during January 1995 to facilitate requests for use of this authority in certain key areas of procurement for peace-keeping operations .  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Recognizing that the new forms of criminal activities of international drug trafficking organizations call for enhanced international cooperation , as well as a renewal of the international commitment to fight against these menaces , and require the formulation of new strategies , approaches and objectives which , respectful of the sovereignty of States , can deal more effectively with the international operations of those involved in the illegal traffic of drugs and arms , the diversion of precursors and essential chemicals , and money laundering through financial and non-financial operations ,  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Efficient and effective use of existing international technical and financial mechanisms , and their comparative advantages for different key issues and subsectors in forestry at the national level .  
AKL ( Lebanon ) said that he would welcome the establishment , by means of a multilateral treaty , of an international criminal court as a permanent and independent judicial organ which would have relations with the United Nations system that would guarantee its authority , universality , and administrative and financial viability .  
Emphasizing the importance of cooperation and international solidarity in supporting the efforts being made by the peoples and Governments of Central America for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace , and the need to strengthen the new programme of cooperation and economic , technical and financial assistance for Central America in the light of the new situation in the region ,  
Supports the treatment accorded to Nicaragua in the light of its continuing exceptional circumstances , so that the international community and financial institutions can incorporate that treatment into programmes to support the country 's economic recovery and social reconstruction ;  
Urgently appeals to all States , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue to provide , on a priority basis and as far as conditions on the ground permit , all possible financial , technical and material assistance for the restoration of the basic services and the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the voluntary , safe and secure return of refugees and internally displaced persons , and appeals to the international financial and development institutions to assist in the planning of the reconstruction of Afghanistan ;  
Governments should promote the establishment of self-sustaining financial mechanisms in support of , inter alia : ( i ) training of personnel ; ( ii ) navigational safety and antipollution measures in international straits ; ( iii ) waste reception facilities in ports ; and ( iv ) salvage and emergency response facilities and capacity-building in hydrographic surveying and nautical charting .  
Donor Governments should consider increasing their financial support to the initiatives undertaken by developing countries and countries with economies in transition , through bilateral and multilateral channels , for national , regional ( including support to regional organizations ) and global programmes .  
In these cities and towns , large sections of the world 's urban population live in inadequate conditions and are confronted with serious problems , including environmental problems , that are exacerbated by inadequate planning and managerial capacities , lack of investment and technology , and insufficient mobilization and inappropriate allocation of financial resources , as well as by a lack of social and economic opportunities .  
Although many countries , particularly developing countries , lack legal , institutional , financial , technological and human resources to respond adequately to rapid urbanization , many local authorities are taking on these challenges with open , accountable and effective leadership and are eager to bring people into the sustainable development process .  
Apply transparent , comprehensive , easily accessible and progressive taxation and incentive mechanisms to stimulate the efficient , environmentally sound and equitable use of land , and exploit the full potential of land-based and other forms of taxation in mobilizing financial resources for service provision by local authorities ;  
To provide opportunities for productive employment and private investment , Governments at the appropriate levels , including local authorities , in consultation with workers ' and employers ' organizations , chambers of commerce , industry , trade , consumer organizations , professional associations , and the financial sector , including the cooperative sector , and in the context of comprehensive urban planning , should :  
The tools for achieving a physically more balanced development include not only specific urban and regional policies and legal , economic , financial , cultural and other measures , but also innovative methods of urban planning and design and of urban development , renewal and management .  
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and the secretariats of the regional commissions , as well as the principal financial and technical institutions and all other partners at the regional and global levels , should consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination in the fields of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
We commit ourselves to strengthening existing financial mechanisms and , where appropriate , developing new mechanisms for financing the implementation of the Habitat Agenda , which will mobilize increased sources of finance - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - at the international , regional , national and local levels , and will promote the efficient , effective and accountable allocation and management of resources .  
Stimulating national and local economies , through enabling competitive and sustainable economic development that will attract public and international financial resources and private investments , generate employment and increase revenues , providing a stronger financial base to support shelter and human settlements development ;  
The international community , including multilateral financial institutions , has an important role to play in providing additional resources to reinforce national efforts to foster an enabling environment so as to achieve the objectives of adequate shelter for all and the sustainable development of human settlements .  
These approaches and frameworks should also include new and improved forms of cooperation and coordination between and among multilateral financial institutions , international organizations , and various organs and bodies of the United Nations system , including South-South , North-South and South-North exchanges of best practices , and the continuous development of tools and instruments for policy , planning and management such as the application of shelter and urban indicators , human resources development and institutional capacity-building . 145 bis .  
The coordination of macroeconomic policies at all levels so as to achieve an international financial system that is conducive to stable and sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Striving to enhance the effectiveness of existing official development assistance and other external financial flows through improving coordination between and among donors and the United Nations operational activities , and through better coherence between those flows and internal sustainable human settlements strategies ;  
Strengthening financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes , and strengthening cooperation among Governments at all levels , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises , and international institutions , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to low-income individuals , women , and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups for shelter and human settlements development ;  
Also invites all other relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions and the World Trade Organization , to contribute to the special session , and requests the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session ;  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
At its first session , the Panel re-emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms , as mutually agreed , and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
The Commission made substantial progress at its third session in identifying and analysing various mechanisms and instruments for the financing of environmentally sound technologies ( ESTs ) , and it indicated that in its future work it would focus on improving the conditions for financing from external financial resources , facilitating access to traditional national financing mechanisms , and promoting innovative mechanisms for the financing of ESTs ( see E / CN . 17 / 1995 / 8 ) .  
Reaffirms that the effective implementation of the Programme of Action will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and , in this context , calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on population and development and to intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries , in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Programme of Action , in order to ensure that population and development objectives and goals are met ;  
Calls upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand , where possible , fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the medium term in controlling malaria , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority ;  
Reiterates its urgent appeal to the international community to continue its efforts to mobilize political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources with a view to assisting Burundi in definitively overcoming the crisis which it has been facing for more than two years ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
At the end of the 12-month period provided in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account until payment is effected ;  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the least developed countries and to enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
Continue to provide financial support to adjustment programmes in LDCs on a timely basis and on terms adapted to the special needs and circumstances of LDCs , adequate external financing for the development and diversification of the productive sector , as well as additional support for poverty eradication , environmental conservation and social programmes ;  
Requests improved annual reporting on financial flows including allocations / expenditures based on consistent criteria , relating to the costed elements of the Programme of Action , including a clear account of levels and trends of funding by source ( bilateral , multilateral ( both core and non-core ) , private , domestic allocations , etc . ) ;  
This effectiveness may be measured by a number of different factors , including the development of new instruments , mechanisms and standards so as to respond to need , as it arises ; the effective integration of environmental and developmental issues ; implementation , monitoring and compliance ; the participation of developing countries in negotiation , implementation , review and governance ; financial and technical assistance to developing countries ; dispute avoidance and settlement ; coordination and consistency among international legal instruments ; and the identification of new and emerging issues in the field of sustainable development .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and , in some cases , inadequate access to technologies , may all hinder implementation and compliance .  
Chapter 39 calls for the provision to developing countries of technical assistance for the purpose of enhancing their national legislative capabilities in the field of environmental law ; it also states ( para . that technical and financial support should include assistance in building up expertise in international law particularly in relation to sustainable development .  
Most burdensome , however , are those requirements for various environmental standards , procurement regulations and reports that must adhere to different guidelines or formats ; ( d ) national politics , commercial demands , varying programming and budget cycles and so forth of donor countries themselves impose constraints to donor coordination ; and ( e ) reductions in financial commitments and technical staff and trends towards decentralized decision-making all complicate coordination . 
Capacity-development , like sustainable development , encompasses a wide range of aspects , including the human , technological , organizational , financial , scientific , cultural and institutional .  
The shift in emphasis from planning to strategy implementation of sustainable development has led practitioners to confront familiar institutional constraints - highly compartmentalized organizations in the public sector , difficulties in promoting more decentralization , the continuation of sectoral thinking and acting , lack of sufficient accountability and responsiveness , a shortage of financial and skilled human resources , poor salary and working conditions , and a lack of a performance culture in many development organizations .  
Invites Member States and regional , international and non-governmental organizations to stand ready to provide assistance in support of progress achieved by the parties towards political dialogue , and to cooperate with the Government of Burundi in initiatives for comprehensive rehabilitation in Burundi , including in military and police reform , judicial assistance , development programmes and support at international financial institutions ;  
Invites Member States and regional , international and non-governmental organizations to stand ready to provide assistance in support of progress achieved by the parties towards political dialogue , and to cooperate with the Government of Burundi in initiatives for comprehensive rehabilitation in Burundi , including in military and police reform , judicial assistance , development programmes and support at international financial institutions ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Electoral Assistance Division with adequate human and financial resources , under the regular budget of the Organization and within existing resources , to allow it to carry out its mandate , and to continue to ensure that the Centre for Human Rights is able to respond , within its mandate and in close coordination with the Electoral Assistance Division , to the increasing number of requests from Member States for advisory services ;  
Bearing in mind the relevant resolutions on the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance during the transition period , a process of peace-keeping and post-conflict peace-building , in particular its resolutions 49 / 137 and 49 / 21 I of 19 and 20 December 1994 , respectively , which emphasize the compelling need to design a new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities established by the Governments of the region ,  
Emphasizes the importance of supporting and strengthening the new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities laid down in the Declaration of Commitments adopted by the Follow-up Committee of the International Conference on Central American Refugees and in the new subregional development strategy , the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America ;  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America ;  
Noting that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community to the implementation of the priority programmes in fulfilment of the Peace Agreement , including the strengthening of democratic institutions , the national reconstruction plan and the economic and social development plan , the implementation of certain programmes and projects basic to the process has continued to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability and the reduction of financial resources in support of the consolidation of peace ,  
Recognizing that El Salvador is at a complex stage in the process of consolidating peace , which calls not only for the implementation of the remaining commitments under the Peace Agreement but also for a new approach involving the implementation and consolidation of medium-term and long-term national development programmes and strategies aimed at resolving the structural problems that are the cause of tension and social instability , and emphasizing the importance and necessity of international technical and financial assistance , both bilateral and multilateral ,  
Renews its invitation to the international financial institutions , in particular the International Monetary Fund , the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development , to continue to pay special attention to the economic problems of the affected States and their adverse social impact and to consider ways and means for mobilizing and providing resources on appropriate terms for mitigating the continuing negative impact of the sanctions on the efforts of the affected States for financial stabilization as well as for development of regional transport and communications infrastructure ;  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
Requests the Government of Burundi to continue its efforts geared towards the achievement of national reconciliation and the maintenance of lasting peace , inter alia , through adherence to the principles of the Convention on Governance , provisions that are essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of humanitarian aid and economic , financial , material and technical assistance to the people of Burundi ;  
Urges all States , United Nations organizations , specialized agencies and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the international financial and development institutions to continue to provide all possible financial , technical and material assistance , bearing in mind that sound economic foundations are vital for achieving lasting stability in Rwanda and for the return and resettlement of Rwandan refugees ;  
The Registry , as the administrative organ , is required to : ( a ) provide legal , procedural , administrative , linguistic and any technical support ; ( b ) be responsible for the financial and accounting administration ; ( c ) also be responsible for documentation , archiving and library services ; ( d ) carry out personnel management and administration ; and ( e ) provide for all purchasing , storage and other general services .  
Experience gained in those missions indicates that , given the complexity of the logistical , contractual and financial issues involved , sufficient time and staff resources should be provided for the in situ completion of all such administrative liquidation tasks , as this reduces the number of unresolved residual matters that have to be dealt with at Headquarters after the liquidation team has been disbanded .  
At the end of the 12-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account until payment is effected ;  
Acting on the recommendation of the Tangier Declaration , the General Assembly adopted resolution 49 / 136 on public administration and development , in which it recognized the important role that Governments and public administrations can play in addressing new responsibilities arising from the pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , and also recognized the need for strengthened public administrative and financial management capacities in order to ensure a civil service that is responsive to the needs of the people .  
The specific topics under the theme " Capacity-building in public administration " were the enhancement of policy development capacity , organizational strengthening , improved civil service systems , the strengthening of financial management for development , human resource development for the public sector , and the development of administrative capacities for post-conflict and crisis conditions .  
For nearly 50 years , the United Nations programme in public administration and finance has actively supported technical cooperation areas of administrative restructuring and reform , human resource development , institutional building in training areas , resource mobilization , financial management and the improved performance of public enterprises .  
By responding to the changing needs of developing countries in strengthening their administrative , financial and information systems for better development management , it is anticipated that better working relationships can be created at the country level between the public and private sector .  
For the past 45 years , pursuant to its various legislative mandates , the United Nations programme in public administration and finance has sought to meet the expressed needs of developing countries in improving their administrative and financial management systems for development .  
While the largest proportion of activities fall into the traditional areas of administrative reform , training and financial systems improvement , it is increasingly common to receive requests from the field in emerging areas such as transparency , accountability , judicial and legislative administration , disaster management , electoral administration and result-oriented management based on productivity improvement .  
Some of these specific issues being addressed include organizational structures ; systems and processes of government for decision-making , budgeting and financial management , personnel management and appropriate incentive systems ; adequate legal and regulatory frameworks ; managerial and technical skills ; and organizational capacity to learn from and adapt to the changing environment . 
At its twelfth meeting , the Group of Experts identified several high-priority areas , such as advice in policy formulation and implementation strategies , administrative restructuring for economic reform , people-oriented development , strategic fiscal and financial management , and strengthening of training in , for example , evaluation and management of change , in which Member States may seek technical help from United Nations agencies . 
The Committee heard an oral representation by the representative of Kyrgyzstan , in which reference was made to the serious financial difficulties of Kyrgyzstan , its over-assessment under the current scale of assessment and the necessity to sustain at least a minimum level of social provision .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Invites Member States , the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue and intensify their efforts to contribute financial and technical support to the efforts of the Government of Rwanda to reconstruct the civil administration and the social , legal , economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda , particularly in the areas of the administration of justice , and welcomes the contributions made , including those at the Round Table Conference at Geneva and its mid-term review , and urges States and donor agencies to fulfil their earlier commitments ;  
While it was clearly stated in the draft resolution as presented that the request for additional meeting time for the Committee should be considered by the General Assembly within the overall existing budget framework , the Secretariat was obliged to make a statement on financial implications in view of the current financial situation faced by the Organization , namely , that : " In adopting the programme budget for 1996-1997 , the General Assembly decided that savings of $ 103.9-million were to be achieved in the programme budget during the biennium .  
13 Insufficient human and financial resources and limited administrative capacities and logistical infrastructure contributed to the low absorptive capacity characteristic of several States of the region , and to a level of activities lower than that envisaged by UNDCP .  
UNDCP will seek to be more closely engaged in securing the involvement and active commitment of potential bilateral donors , international financial institutions , agencies and programmes within the United Nations system and regional organizations involved in development work .  
I believe that it would be a grievous setback for the Organization if , because of the current financial debate , it became impossible to retain MICIVIH , whose presence is essential to consolidate the Organization 's and Members States ' remarkable achievements in Haiti , and MINUGUA , whose presence is fundamental to realization of the best prospects that have ever existed to bring to an end the armed confrontation which has afflicted the people of Guatemala for 35 years .  
At the end of the 12-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the special account until payment is effected ;  
Assistant Budget Officer ( P-2 ) .  Reporting to the Budget Officer , the incumbent would be responsible for ( a ) coordinating , collecting and organizing proposed budgets of substantive offices ; ( b ) assisting in the preparation of budgets and performance reports of UNAVEM and the monitoring of allotments ; and ( c ) preparing standard and special financial budgetary reports and related correspondence , as required , for the Chief Administrative Officer .  
Stressing the necessity of promoting and implementing policies to create a supportive international economic environment , through , inter alia , alleviation of the external debt burden and the negative impact of structural adjustment programmes , through mobilization and / or the provision of new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , and by ensuring equitable terms of trade and increased access of women in developing countries to markets , productive investments and technologies ,  
Endorses the conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory Committee as contained in its report ; 3 .  Reiterates its requests to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and to report on the action that he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
KOVACS ( International Telecommunication Union ) introducing the thirty-fifth report of the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) on telecommunication and the peaceful uses of outer space ( A / AC . 105 / 634 ) , said that the past year had been extremely challenging , with an upsurge in interest in space-related communications , continuing technological developments , a changing administrative and financial environment and a growing demand for spectrum and orbit utilization .  
Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and requests him to report on the action he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
While the United Nations system continues to provide technical cooperation assistance and advisory services of a neutral and non-commercial nature in the field of mineral resources at the request of Member States , its ability to do so has been severely diminished owing to evolutions in the funding of technical cooperation activities , and current budgetary reductions and the financial situation in the United Nations Secretariat .  
Directly tied into this process has been the continued dissemination of individual country information through the very successful investment seminars and round-table discussions which have enabled private companies , financial institutions and technical advisers to gain a better understanding of various countries and their risk factors , and to develop good working relationships with private and government officials and the multilateral and bilateral aid institutions , all with a view towards creating a sustainable economic and environmentally sound base of operations on which to build within the various countries .  
Moreover , they were faced with severe financial constraints ( inadequate local funds , difficulties in raising loans from international markets and severe debt burdens due to restrictions on commercial bank lending ) .  
The private sector is slowly responding through increased financial investment , the development of primary and ancillary industries and businesses around mining , the implementation of education and training programmes for local workforces , the transfer of technology and the deepening of institutions required to sustain growth .  
Continue to support the role of multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies in the provision of structured finance including loans and equity ; senior lender guarantees ; political risk insurance and re-insurance ; in the development of small supporting businesses , through soft loans ; and in the development of internal financial institutions through loans and guarantees and the introduction of stock exchanges etc .  
Government and local business representatives should be encouraged to participate in national and international industry and technical groups as a means of facilitating technology transfer , gaining market intelligence , raising and keeping apprised of industry-wide issues and concerns and as a means of formulating long-term relationships with other industrial , government and financial leaders .  Local and national Chambers of Mines should be fully activated and supported in order to act as an effective vehicle for handling industry-wide concerns and effectively working with the appropriate governmental bodies .  
An action programme can then be prepared , based on the survey results , with a view to : ( a ) establishing enabling conditions for artisanal mining , ( b ) alleviating technical and financial constraints , and ( c ) improving the environmental , living and working conditions of miners .  
Confronting mining issues , such as the technical , legal and financial constraints faced , as well as environmental pollution and degradation , is necessary but not sufficient for solving the problems inherent in artisanal mining , since one of the problems associated with this type of mining is that it may create immediate income but often does not create improved living conditions or social development for the regions in which it occurs .  
One successor State reported that it adhered to all international treaties , and made proposals to the police of other countries to sign new bilateral agreements , particularly on cooperation in combating all types of transnational crime , such as organized crime , drug trafficking and economic and financial crime .  
It will require considerable technical expertise ( chemical , forensic , pharmacological and legal ) , as well as financial resources , at the country level .  
The new criminal provisions against money-laundering were based on the assumption that money-laundering could be defined as the systematic disguising of illegal assets , using the scope offered by the legal financial market , with a view to shielding them from seizure by the criminal prosecution authorities and preserving their economic value .  
The legislation regulating the use of cash exceeding 20-million liras ensured the identification of bank and financial brokers , and imposed upon them the obligation to inform the Questore of all suspicious transactions , without incurring penal and administrative sanctions because their collaboration exonerated them from criminal liability .  
Mexico had taken various measures and implemented a number of actions to prevent , detect and combat money-laundering , taking into account that one of its main origins was drug trafficking , the vast proceeds of which were being channelled into national financial and commercial systems , a process that was being fostered by the increasing technological sophistication of the international finance system .  
Those amendments also introduced a requirement for banks and special financial institutions to report to the competent authorities all transfers abroad of Turkish lira and foreign currency exceeding US $ 50,000 or its equivalent , except in the case of exports , imports and invisible transactions .  
The United States strongly supported the efforts of the United Nations and other global and regional initiatives designed to promote the harmonization of the world 's financial , regulatory and legal regimes , thereby achieving more effective control of the laundering of the proceeds of serious crime .  
Besides encouraging States to become parties to the 1988 Convention , to enact financial legislation that did not run counter to the guidelines of FATF , and to increase multilateral cooperation in investigations and prosecutions , the recommendations focused on the improvement of national legal systems to combat money-laundering , the enhancement of the role of the financial system , understood in its broadest sense , and the strengthening of international cooperation .  
Non-bank financial institutions include a wide variety of exchange houses , cheque-cashing services , insurers , mortgagers , brokers , importers , exporters , trading companies , gold and precious metal dealers , casinos , express delivery services and other money movers of varying degrees of sophistication and capability , and other underground banking systems .  
Stress the need to develop a greater range of more attractive positive measures , such as effective instruments to facilitate financial and technology transfers to developing countries in order to assist them to meet multilaterally agreed targets , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility ; and recommend that positive measures are preferable to the threat of the use of trade restrictions to secure compliance with the objectives of the MEA .  
In addition , its stable currency and Government , advanced financial system , free movement of funds and democratic safeguards against police powers together make Canada inviting to persons engaging in international money-laundering .  
18 If transnational criminal organizations reap considerable benefits from their links with the licit business and financial sectors , they also find it both necessary and advantageous to co-opt public officials , whether to obtain official documents or export licences , to help launder the proceeds of criminal activity or to provide intelligence .  
Such a method of operation may be characterized by widespread use of bribery and favours to ensure the malleability of key positions and agencies ; political funding to ensure that politicians elected to office will be indebted to the criminal organizations ; carefully targeted " payoffs " to law enforcement personnel to provide intelligence ; and the provision of financial incentives to members of the judiciary to ensure that the penalties for criminal activities are either not imposed or are modest .  
Italy has expressed its conviction that , in the face of expanding organized transnational crime and the effects of such expansion on global financial systems , the international community should develop an organized and systematized global response .  The innovative aspect of the World Ministerial Conference held at Naples was its emphasis on a global approach to organized transnational crime regardless of its manifestations .  
On the contrary , this threat is an inevitable consequence of the activities of organizations that deny the State its legitimate monopoly of violence , corrupt State institutions , undermine the rule of law , threaten the integrity of financial and commercial sectors of society , contravene legal and social norms and conventions , transgress national sovereignty and violate national borders . 
The loss of political momentum is a consequence of a short attention span , combat fatigue and a deep fiscal crisis of the public sector in practically all OECD countries , a crisis that is epitomized by the current situation of the United Nations , which is plagued by financial collapse , a distorted image and low morale . 
The requested oral report on the status of an interregional workshop to formulate a pilot project ( for an appropriate region ) which should develop standard approaches to the identification and qualitative assessment of permissive tracts and be based on geographical information system technology , that would allow integration with other land management information will not be presented due to the current financial situation of the United Nations , which has prevented the workshop from being financed and prepared . 
38 The Holy See suggested that the Congress should focus on the development of new international legal instruments and forms of international jurisdiction to combat transnational crime linked to : speculative financial transactions severely harming the economy of one or more States ; activities , also undertaken by private persons , provoking very severe harm to the environment of other States ; extensive terrorism resulting from organized transnational crime ; and the role of education in combating violence and organized criminality .  
The Registry , as the administrative organ , is required to : ( a ) provide legal , procedural , administrative , linguistic and any technical support ; ( b ) be responsible for the financial and accounting administration ; ( c ) also be responsible for documentation , archiving and library services ; ( d ) carry out personnel management and administration ; and ( e ) provide for all purchasing , storage and other general services .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace of global economic developments and their implications for all countries , particularly developing countries , and the critical importance of efficient and effective government institutions , administrative systems and procedures , and sound financial management to harness these changes in support of economic and social progress and sustainable development ,  
Noting that improved efficiency in government requires strengthened and efficient public administrative and financial management capacities in order to ensure a civil service that is responsive to the needs of the economy and the civil society and the provision of quality services ,  
Undertaking research on effective systems and procedures in public administration , with particular attention devoted to the civil service systems , administrative structures and administrative reorganization , decentralization , aid management , accountability , financial management , metropolitan and local governance , approaches to rehabilitation and reconstruction of government and administrative services in post-conflict situations , and to ensure the timely distribution of these research results to Member States ;  
Within [ a ] [ the ] stated period [ of one / two years ] after separation from public service , public officials holding managerial positions shall , within the framework of national law , obtain governmental permission prior to accepting employment or consultancy assignments from business or private concerns that are in [ direct ] financial relationship with the governmental department or agency in which such officials were employed .  
Behind the trafficking in children were situations involving poverty and abandonment , which often stemmed from social and economic problems of families , such as widespread unemployment ; little State support for large families or for families with little income ; young persons quitting school because of financial problems of their families ; debts of families contracted with usurers or with criminal organizations repaid by illicit work or illicit activities involving minors ; and moral or social degeneration in suburbs .  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to ensure that the number of special envoys , special representatives and other special high-level positions is kept at a minimum , that their functions and responsibilities are more clearly defined and streamlined , avoiding any possible duplication , and that current financial regulations and budgetary procedures are fully complied with , and requests him to report on the action he has taken in this regard to the General Assembly at its resumed fiftieth session .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace and interdependence of global , political , social and economic developments , and their implications for all countries , particularly the developing countries , and that there is a critical need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management to harness these challenges in support of sustainable development in all countries ,  
In particular , the net inflow of external financial resources and the greater or lesser uncertainty prevailing in domestic markets as a result of foreign or domestic events were decisive factors in the policies applied in response to the crisis .  
Most ESCWA member countries have developed , or are developing , strategies or plans to combat environmental degradation and achieve sustainable development .  However , financial constraints and reduced public expenditure are apparently hindering the implementation of such strategies and plans .  
In addition , the costs of building additional storage facilities and conveyance systems are soaring , and attempts to recover costs have so far met with little progress ; financial constraints are contributing to a revision of previous policies ; and many contemporary projects are being questioned by vocal environmental movements .  
Thus , while the Advisory Panel has traditionally met once a month , it recently agreed to meet twice monthly , one meeting to address immediate and ongoing management and financial issues , and the other meeting to be devoted to discussions of major policy issues and the development of strategic directives .  
Special attention was given to the building and effective utilization of critical human , institutional and infrastructural capacities , particularly in the production , trade , monetary and financial , and physical infrastructure fields , as well as for the enhancement of public and private sector development and management .  
A second objective will be to increase awareness of the changing nature , volume and direction of international financial flows , propose ways and means to enhance and stabilize both official and private finance , monitor changes in the external debt situation and identify innovative approaches and strategies to resolve the difficulties of countries with debt-servicing problems ;  
While the reduction of posts was a factor in determining final output , the main consideration of the comprehensive review was to find a sustainable level of resources , taking into account the workload analysis for the period under review and bearing in mind the financial constraints faced by the Organization .  
Since private capital flows are becoming a major source of financing for developing countries , African countries that seem to be involved in a process of adjusting their financial structures and liberalizing their economies are likely to attract foreign resources , both for portfolio , and more particularly , direct investment .  Creation of domestic capital markets , as complementary measures to the process of economic liberalization and privatization , is essential if the countries need to broaden and improve the savings / investment process .  
But the most important prerequisites for the successful mobilization of foreign and domestic resources are confidence in the financial system and appropriate macroeconomic policies , a well-established and clear legal and regulatory framework , a transparent and non-distortionary taxation system , a stable domestic financial system , and adequate infrastructure .  
Stabilization of prices and exchange rates would ensure positive rates of return on domestic assets , while a more aggressive drive by the formal financial institutions through intensive branch expansion , the broadening of the menu of saving instruments and the forging of strong linkages with the informal financial institutions , would have a positive impact on the volume of resources mobilized .  
Strengthening and improving financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes and strengthening cooperation among Governments , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises and international agencies , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to small entrepreneurs , small farmers and other low-income self-employed workers , with particular efforts to ensure the availability of such services to women .  
In addition , their capacity to take advantage of the expansionary cycles of international and regional trade and to withstand adverse conditions and financial instability must be increased through the diversification of products and markets , the search for foreign investment and partnerships , the use of domestic stabilization mechanisms and better linkages between exports and other productive activities .  
Special attention will be paid to two issues : the compatibility between economic policy ( fiscal , monetary and exchange rate policies ) and the structural reforms that are being implemented in the region ; and the new types of external constraints that could result from financial globalization and the development of new debt instruments and facilities ;  
The tasks identified by the Secretary-General included availability and management of water , sustainable food security , capacity - building for governance , social and human development and mobilization of external and internal financial resources for African development .  
The volume and quality of the work the Institute has been able to perform is noteworthy , taking into consideration the reduced number of professional staff available , the numerous vacancies at the management level , and the limited financial resources at its disposal .  
If there exists substantiated evidence of overt and covert governmental financial influence or otherwise to induce an organization to undertake acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , or substantiated evidence of influence from proceeds resulting from criminal activities , such as the illicit drugs trade , money laundering or the illegal arms trade ; EU proposes :  
Also calls upon the international community to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including ( , as mutually agreed , ) on concessional and grant terms ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus until payment is effected .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Mission in Haiti until payment is effected ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda until payment is effected ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Mission in Haiti until payment is effected .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus until payment is effected .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda until payment is effected ;  
The Executive Board also decided that the allocation of resources should be based on a comprehensive assessment of the actual needs and requirements of countries , and should take fully into consideration coherent national programmes , plans and strategies on population and development and the need for external resources to complement national financial efforts in the area of population and development ; and endorsed the procedure for categorization of countries into three groups as outlined in the report and approved the relative shares of resources among them .  
At the same time , the financial benefits of common premises are not evident in all cases , particularly if a move into joint premises can not fully accommodate all operational requirements , or if various current premises are provided by the Government free of charge as part of its in-kind contribution to the organizations , or if opportunities for appropriate premises are scarce and initial costs of moving are significant .  
As the implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require adequate funding , we must mobilize financial resources at the national and international levels , including new and additional resources from all sources - multilateral and bilateral , public and private .  In this connection , we must facilitate capacity-building and promote the transfer of appropriate technology and know-how .  
Performance generally reflected strong growth in tourism and in offshore financial services , as well as increased domestic investment , with the gross domestic product recorded at US $ 90.2-million .  
The unsatisfactory housing situation was attributed to a number of constraints , including the lack of a national housing policy and implementation strategy reflecting current and prospective economic realities , inadequate delivery of land for housing , the lack of financial mechanisms that cater to the needs of the low - and middle-income groups , and high construction costs in relation to incomes .  
Throughout the year , the ESCAP Pacific Operations Centre offered advisory and technical assistance to Pacific island countries in development programming , central banking , macroeconomic policy formulation , financial systems , trade promotion , development of port infrastructure and macroeconomic management , and provided short consultancies upon specific requests .  
Economic development and cooperation , documents were issued on the annual survey of economic and social developments in the ESCWA region , 1994 ; stock markets in the ESCWA region ; developments and issues in the external trade and payments situation of countries of Western Asia ; developments and trends in the monetary and financial sectors ; revitalization of research and development activities in selected countries of the ESCWA region ; and techno-economic aspects of the application of new materials in the ESCWA region .  
In paragraph 2 ( b ) of its resolution 1995 / 56 , the Economic and Social Council urged the governing bodies of relevant organizations of the United Nations system to review , during the period from 1995 to 1997 , issues concerning the role and operational responsibilities , as well as the operative and financial capacities , of their respective organizations to respond , within their mandates , in the context of broad and comprehensive humanitarian programmes .  
Providing the programme planning , financial , personnel , legal , management , administrative and general services that are essential for the rational selection of work items and allocating resources among them and for the effective , economic and efficient performance of the services and functions of the Secretariat , within the legal framework of regulations , rules and policies adopted by the Assembly .  
The European Union is of the view that these objectives are attainable through a strengthened political dialogue to be held on a regular basis , through the development of financial and economic cooperation and by granting a more important role to the social , human and cultural dimensions of this dialogue .  
Ukraine is prepared to cooperate in the effort to combat terrorism , international organized crime , illegal trafficking in narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances , explosives , poisonous substances and radioactive materials , and illegal transborder movements of persons , cargoes , goods and valuables ; in the effort to suppress crimes against persons and government property , and criminal offences in the economic , financial and banking spheres ; and in exchanges of convicted persons .  
Arranging for dissemination to the public of information on the Authority 's activities and decisions ; ( i ) Providing the programme planning , financial , personnel , legal , management and general services that are essential for the rational selection of work items and allocating resources among them and for the effective , economical and efficient performance of the services and functions of the Secretariat , within the legal framework of regulations , rules and policies adopted by the Assembly .  
While it is the primary responsibility of African States to bear the bulk of their development burden by tapping as a matter of priority their own financial resources , the rigid international economic environment , the domestic economic hardship and the lukewarm disposition of some creditors to adopt radical measures have constituted obstacles to the mobilization of financial resources and to the development of Africa .  
ESCAP / POC currently has an advisory strength of nine advisers covering such diverse areas as economic and financial management , development and strategic planning , physical planning , sustainable development , social development , women in development , trade and investment , and ports and harbours development .  
Considerable international technical and financial assistance is provided by the housing cooperative movement in developed countries ; for example , for 44 years , the United States Cooperative Housing Foundation has supported projects in 90 countries , and is currently active in 30 , including major projects in South Africa and Poland . CECODHAS and ICA Housing work energetically in support of housing cooperatives in the transitional economies . 
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus until payment is effected .  
Considering the current economic and financial situation worldwide , the decreasing levels of official development assistance and the concentration of private investment in countries with abundant forest resources , special attention will have to be given to the needs of the least developed countries with low forest cover .  NULLIn addressing the needs and requirements of countries with areas of low forest cover or with low forest cover overall , particularly developing countries , the Panel may wish to consider the proposals outlined below .  
In respect of such currencies , the financial statements , prepared at such intervals as may be prescribed by the Controller under delegation of authority from the Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management , shall reflect the cash , investments , unpaid pledges and current accounts receivable and payable in currencies other than United States dollars , translated at the applicable United Nations rates of exchange in effect as at the date of the statements .  
Other indicators of the deepening integration of countries in transition with international capital markets are the rise in borrowing by private and partially privatized corporations and municipalities ( departing from the past practice of uniquely sovereign borrowing ) , the use of a broader range of instruments ( for example , increasing use of syndicated loans in addition to bonds ) , and further geographical and currency diversification of financial sources .  
With regard to technical assistance , ESCAP has focused on strengthening national management capacities in developing the financial , industrial , infrastructural , trading and other institutional framework required in managing transition to a market economy .  
Efforts in management development , civil service reform and decentralization include support to national and local government administrations , improvement of financial auditing and control at all levels , capacity-building in the areas of foreign investment promotion and negotiation , support for the development of participatory approaches to environmental management and technical assistance to develop Governments ' capacities in the area of informatics .  
Many serious technical problems have been noted in the use of physical infrastructure , such as outdated vehicles and rolling stock , lack of repair facilities , lack of financial means to buy new vehicles , problems of break gauge , bogie change and axle load on railroads , and problems of CIS brake systems and automatic coupling ( SA-3 ) , which are not compatible with the wagons and trains of non-CIS countries .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
The third session of the Commission and the first session of the Panel emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms as mutually agreed and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account the ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
The principal implications of this approach for donors and financing agencies would entail ( a ) using local administrative units as a basis for designing donors supported programmes , ( b ) increasing reliance on local resources in implementation , both human and material and ( c ) using participatory structures for programme management , supported by transparent mechanisms for financial control at the local level .  
It is desirable for the information systems to be Internet-based for this would allow easy access and information-sharing among multilateral agencies , countries ' institutions , non-governmental organizations and other interested parties .  The Panel may wish to invite relevant multilateral forest agencies and international organizations to review and initiate the development of improved information systems that support activities for sustainable forest management , particularly so as to facilitate private sector investment , speed up technology transfer to developing countries and improve coordination in financial assistance .  
None of the existing international legal instruments , as they currently stand , may have the potential to fully ensure a coordinated approach in international policy , financial issues and integration at the institutional level regarding forests and forest-related activities .  
Indigenous people should have access to adequate financial and technical assistance , from States and through international cooperation , to pursue freely their cultural , economic , social and spiritual development and for the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms recognized in the present Declaration .  
Taking into account the understanding that emerged from discussions held on issues relating to programme element I . 1 during the second session of the Panel and at national , regional and international meetings after the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , including the expert meetings on financial mechanisms and on the Implementation of the Forest Principles ( see para . 5 ) , the Panel may wish to consider endorsing the elements of national forest programmes discussed below as applicable to all types of forests .  
The objectives of the review were to determine whether the management structure of the civilian component was appropriate in providing the necessary support service to UNPF , to assess the adequacy of management systems and internal controls and to ascertain whether the use of United Nations resources ( human , physical and financial ) was adequately planned , organized , directed and monitored , and whether value for money was achieved .  
Finally , as will be discussed below , improved information on markets and revenues is required in order to assess the additional financial assistance that may be needed by low-income producer countries if they are to adopt sustainable forest management and the most efficient and equitable international mechanism for providing that assistance .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Delayed publication of semi-annual financial statements ; elimination of miscellaneous supplemental schedules to the main financial statement ; elimination of preliminary unaudited financial statements for regular budget and peace-keeping budgets at the end of the biennium ; elimination of supplementary annex to technical cooperation report . ( b ) Payments and disbursements .  
To take measures to promote the awareness of all parties concerned ( be they developing countries , non-governmental organizations or other public or private bodies active in this field ) , of the important role that communication plays in the development process , thus contributing to mobilizing the technical and financial resources needed for pursuing the goals and objectives of the Programme .  
The sanctions secretariat has established working contacts and elaborated practical modalities for cooperation with other parts of the Secretariat , relevant programmes and agencies of the United Nations system and international financial institutions in order to provide better information and early assessments about the actual or potential effects of sanctions on third States .  
The objective should be , therefore , to develop a common methodology that could be used by the affected States in preparing the explanatory material for their requests for assistance , as well as by the United Nations system , the international financial institutions and the donor community in considering how their assistance activities may be helpful to mitigate the special economic problems of those States .  
On the other hand , indirect effects , which are , largely , the induced effects of the former , represent mainly the negative impact on domestic variables and may include disrupted production owing to the absence or higher cost of sanctioned supplies , suspended financial inputs and services , foregone profit tax or tariff revenues , lost jobs and the need to increase social benefits .  
In principle , estimates should cover both the direct , first round impact of sanctions ( which is evaluated as the income forgone and additional costs incurred , resulting from terminated trade in goods and services and suspended financial transfers ) and the indirect , second round effects such as the reduction of imported inputs following the decline of exports or output .  
Accordingly , the Secretary-General addressed letters , in July and September of 1993 and January of 1994 , to the executive heads of the competent organs and specialized agencies of the United Nations system , including the international financial organizations ( the World Bank and IMF ) and the regional development banks , requesting them to provide him with updated information on activities undertaken by them to alleviate the special economic problems of the affected States .  
As reported in the annual overview report for 1993 , the information received regarding additional measures or special assistance in response to the immediate hardships encountered and urgent needs faced by the affected countries was largely of a preliminary nature , which reflected the need to assess the extent of the impact of sanctions on the economies of the affected countries in order to assist them in developing appropriate policy responses and in preparing financial requirements for remedial measures . 
There have been financial losses of some $ 890-million owing to the non-implementation of letters of credit in , for example , the importation of ready-made clothing and shoes , milk and other baby food , electric and other domestic appliances , spare parts , home and office furniture , and other essential goods imported from abroad to meet the consumption needs of the local market ;  
New ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development , including poverty eradication , should be explored .  
Invites the financial and trade institutions participating in the high-level segment of the Council in 1997 to furnish relevant special reports and studies on the selected theme , within their respective mandates and areas of expertise , and on important developments in the world economy and in international economic cooperation ;  
In Costa Rica , it has assisted in the promotion of a national policy for the training of local administrators , specifically in financial management , as well as facilitating the creation of a Metropolitan Council for the City of San Jos ; and has supported the " State of the Nation " initiative , consisting of a participatory scheme to produce an annual report of the country 's sustainable human development performance and its most significant challenges . 
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
In view of the politico-economic environment in which well over half the 1995 expenditure was incurred , it is still considered that the additional resources , both human and financial , which would be required to analyse and forecast the inflation and exchange rate variation factors with any degree of reliability would be costly to UNHCR , the degree of reliability would most probably not be reached , and the added value to UNHCR would most probably be minimal .  
It will also draw up specific programmes as follow-up to the decisions taken in Agenda 21 and the Commission on Sustainable Development regarding the provision of adequate and predictable new and additional financial resources to developing countries , and mechanisms for the transfer of technology to those countries , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed in paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 " .  
Furthermore , the provisions of the resolution should be taken fully into account and implemented in a comprehensive and integrated manner , comprising all the necessary elements at the national and international levels , particularly those related to technology transfer , financial resources and enabling international economic environment through new initiatives for strengthening institutional capacity for enhancing international development cooperation .  
Thus , it should improve and support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development , concentrating on the needs of the population and the eradication of poverty .  
On 2 November 1995 , the General Assembly adopted resolution 50 / 10 , entitled " Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba " , in which it requested the Secretary-General , in consultation with the appropriate organs and agencies of the United Nations system , to prepare a report on the implementation of the resolution in the light of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and to submit it to the Assembly at its fifty-first session .  
At the eleventh summit meeting of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , the heads of State or Government " called upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial measures and actions against Cuba which , in addition to being unilateral and contrary to the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and to the principle of neighbourliness , cause huge material losses and economic damage " .  
As has been shown , the Helms-Burton Act reinforces the United States Government 's traditional policy of imposing an economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba in order to strangle the country economically and force changes on the country 's political , social and institutional order .  
Also in that resolution , the General Assembly renewed its invitation to the international financial institutions to continue to pay special attention to the economic problems of the affected States and their adverse social impact and to consider ways and means for mobilizing and providing resources on appropriate terms for mitigating the continuing negative impact of the sanctions on those States .  
The Assembly renewed its request to the competent organs , programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations system to take into consideration , in programming their development activities , the special needs of the affected States and to consider providing assistance to them from their special programme resources , and renewed its appeal to all States , on an urgent basis , to provide technical , financial and material assistance to the affected States to mitigate the adverse impact of the sanctions on their economies .  
In addition , by a series of letters dated 16 April 1996 , the Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis , on behalf of the Secretary-General , requested the competent organs , programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations system , including the international financial institutions , as well as the regional organizations concerned , to provide him with updated information on the activities undertaken by them in response to the relevant provisions of the resolution .  
Decides further that any exceptions to this rule may be made by the body concerned only if the statements are to serve as bases for discussion and if , after hearing a statement of the relevant financial implications , the body decides that one or more statements in extenso may be included in the summary record , or reproduced as separate documents or as annexes to authorized documents . "  
At the Social Summit , Heads of State or Government acknowledged that the primary responsibility to attain the goals set out in the Copenhagen Declaration and Programme of Action rested with national Governments , with the support and contributions of the international community , the United Nations , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society , including private citizens .  
It stressed the need to implement sound and stable macroeconomic , microeconomic and sectoral policies that encouraged broad-based , sustained economic growth and development , and called upon the international community to seek to mobilize additional financial resources that were both adequate and predictable to contribute to poverty eradication .  
The Ministers noted the enormous cost and rapid changes in information and communication technology , which presently outpace the rate of acquisition and utilization of such communication equipment by developing countries , thus posing immense financial and technical difficulties and increasing the information and communication gap between developed and developing countries and their dependence on external broadcast and information .  
With financial support from Germany , preparatory work is already under way on a high-impact programme for entrepreneurship development among women , under which 10 national programmes will be elaborated , each aimed at releasing the principal technical , managerial , financial , institutional and policy constraints affecting the development of women 's entrepreneurship .  
It called upon the international community , in particular the donor countries , to expand , where possible , fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the medium term in controlling malaria , and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority .  
In the same resolution , the General Assembly encouraged the Director-General of WHO , through the WHO Division of Control of Tropical Diseases , to continue his efforts to mobilize international organizations , multilateral financial institutions , the specialized agencies , organs and programmes of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations as well as other groups to provide the affected developing countries , in particular African countries , with technical , medical and financial resources and assistance commensurate with the needs set forth in those countries ' national plans to control malaria .  
At the same time , the possibilities of financial support from non-traditional sources of funding , which have been opened up by the new partnerships established by the Habitat secretariat with , among others , the organized private sector , private foundations and municipal and local authorities , will be actively pursued by the Centre . D . Involvement of local authorities and civil society ,  
They include financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal liability of the member of the force . 
Changes and modifications proposed in the existing mechanism , such as , creating multiple claims review boards , increasing their financial authority and provision of additional experienced staff at the field and Headquarters levels , are designed to address the practical difficulties encountered .  
They include : financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from States contributing contingents for damage caused by gross negligence , wilful misconduct , or which entails the international criminal responsibility of the individual member of the Force .  
Other key events that created volatility in the currency and financial markets included the derivative losses incurred by established institutions and corporations , the Mexican financial crisis , which affected emerging markets in general , the strength of the yen against the dollar , and the continued struggle by the European Union to meet the convergence criteria for economic and monetary union .  
The following thematic areas were considered at the meeting : ( a ) policy development capacity and administrative restructuring , civil service reform and management training ; ( b ) financial management ; ( c ) human resources development ; ( d ) public-private interaction ; ( e ) public sector efficiency ; ( f ) social development ; ( g ) infrastructure and the environment ; ( h ) legal and regulatory framework ; ( i ) post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction of government machinery ; and ( j ) management of development programmes .  
The above savings were realized mainly as a result of more favourable rates for the hire of aircraft used for rotation of military personnel ; receipt of additional vehicles , equipment and supplies from other missions ; cancellation and deferment of maintenance projects as part of the special measures taken in relation to the bad financial situation in the United Nations ; and the reduced prices offered by the Government of the Syrian Arab Republic for petrol , oil and other lubricants .  
Urges Member States carefully to consider the problems posed by the international aspects of corrupt practices , especially as regards international economic activities carried out by corporate entities , and to study appropriate legislative and regulatory measures to ensure the transparency and integrity of financial systems and transactions carried out by such corporate entities ;  
Mobilizing adequate , timely and predictable financial resources , including new and additional funding from the Global Environment Facility of the agreed incremental costs of those activities concerning desertification that relate to its four focal areas , in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Instrument establishing the Global Environment Facility ;  
The Assembly requested relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and the multilateral financial institutions to strengthen their efforts to assist interested developing countries in the formulation and implementation of national water policies and strategies , and called upon the international community to give special attention to the revitalization of economic growth and sustainable development in developing countries , through , inter alia , a more diversified food and agriculture sector .  
The promise is that if food import prices rise because of the Uruguay Round , net food-importing developing countries and the least developed countries could be eligible for increased food aid , financial support to maintain normal food imports , technical support to raise agricultural productivity , and eventually favourable treatment on agricultural export credits .  
Especially fruitful cooperation was established with the Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation , which funded and organized the printing and dissemination of additional copies of the Compendium of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice in French , as well as the translation into French of the Basic Training Manual for Correctional Workers , and provided financial support also for the implementation of a comprehensive project in assistance to the criminal justice system for Burkina Faso , which was undertaken in March 1996 .  
The General Assembly in its resolution 50 / 113 invited all relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system , including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) , the specialized agencies and other multilateral organizations , including multilateral financial institutions and WTO , to contribute to the special session , and requested the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , in close coordination with the Commission on Sustainable Development , to ensure an effective and coordinated system-wide response to the preparation of the special session .  
Such measures should help the least developed countries to meet their obligations under the said agreements ; to secure financial , technical and technological support , as agreed in the relevant agreements ; and to secure compensation for losses they have suffered during implementation of the said agreements .  
This situation is particularly lamentable in the light of the fact that several States parties to the Convention are in possession of the financial and technical means to enable them to establish a system of rapid alert in regions where political situations are identified as being volatile .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi - and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
At the same time , in many developing countries , the formulation of coherent and implementable national strategies is contingent on adequate international support , technical and financial .  
Additional financial resources are called for , whether obtained through established means including increased and dependable official development assistance , better mobilization of domestic resources and greater direct foreign investment , or through innovative means .  
In spite of the difficult world economic climate , Tunisia has also managed to achieve encouraging results , illustrated in a rate of growth in national product averaging 4.8 per cent over the last four years ; an increase in non-agricultural industrial exports at an annual rate of 13 per cent ; and an improvement in employment potential , with demand for employment fully absorbed for the first time ; while at the same time the country 's financial equilibrium has been preserved and its external debt brought under control .  
The strengthening of the private sector 's role in the development process and in the creation of jobs has been accompanied by an investment promotion policy focused on a recasting of the Investment Codes into a single , better adapted and more flexible Code covering all economic sectors and the financial and fiscal reforms .  
In addition , while the State attends to the legal framework , the training of specialized personnel , the enhancement of public awareness , and the mobilization of most of the financial resources ( through the Special Fund for the Disabled created in 1988 ) , the associative sector plays a leading role in specialized education , occupational training and rehabilitation for disabled persons who can not attend a normal institution .  
Cancellation of " provision for unscheduled meetings approved in the course of the biennium " will likely be of marginal benefit and may be disruptive , since such meetings are usually scheduled taking into account already existing conference services capacity and are quite often called to consider programmes of work , budgetary , financial and other important matters .  
Following consideration as to what viable alternatives might be possible , the High Commissioner created a yearly human rights fund for field activities of $ 25-million to minimize the instability and uncertainty that has complicated current field operations , and to ensure that , when called for in future , a human rights field operation could be deployed urgently , without unnecessary delay arising from financial constraints .  
They stressed that the solution to the debt problem must go much further than the establishment of transitory relief measures and be based on a genuine joint effort between debtors and creditors without selectivity , taking into account all the dimensions of the problem and ensuring a net transfer of financial resources to indebted countries .  
They emphasized with grave concern that , while the Conference , Agenda 21 and other international instruments on environmental subjects invoked a new spirit of partnership and cooperation , four years after the Conference the required new and additional financial resources had not been allocated and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies on concessional and preferential terms , scientific and technical cooperation and the appropriate dissemination of information had not materialized .  
Overcoming the many years of conflict in Angola would not only be a major blessing for a country which is friendly to us , for its people and for other States in the region of southern Africa , but would also be a substantial success for the peacemaking efforts of the United Nations and of the international community as a whole , which have invested significant human , material and financial resources in support of the Angolan peace process .  
While OIOS does not question the noble purpose of the seminars as the General Assembly has approved them , the issue of the efficient and effective use of funds for continuing to hold the seminars at a time of financial crisis for the Organization is worth objective and independent consideration .  
In paragraphs 38 to 44 of his report , the Secretary-General discusses several means of limiting the liability of the Organization , such as financial and temporal limitation , counter-claims and off-sets , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal responsibility on the part of a member of the force .  
The Council decided that , prior to the annual high-level policy dialogue , and allowing sufficient time for preparation , the Secretariat should communicate to the financial and trade institutions a report on the relevant issues to be discussed at the session , with a primary focus on the agreed theme ; and that communication should be prepared in part based on the submission of issues and questions that Member States could be invited to suggest to the Secretariat , which would then be taken into account in the preparation of the Secretariat 's report to the institutions .  
Many delegations , while supporting in general the proposals for contributions by host governments towards local office costs ( GLOC ) , requested additional information regarding the financial impact of the proposals , in particular the financial impact of applying the revised programme thresholds for providing international staff to some net contributor countries ( NCCs ) , and the impact of the three-year waiver period following graduation .  
The Administration notes that a number of measures have been taken that are in line with this recommendation : the numeric control system for LOAs has been developed and linked to the financial database to ensure that an appropriate obligating document is prepared in connection with every LOA ; miscellaneous obligating documents ( MODs ) are obligated at Headquarters and the field is provided with a monthly allotment report that reflects the disbursements and obligations against the MODs ; the modified text of LOAs now includes reference to receiving and inspection reports to facilitate identification .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionment their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,970,718 United States dollars gross ( 1,718,168 dollars net ) for the period from 16 May 1995 to 12 January 1996 ;  
The Agency would start the 1997 budget year having reduced its budget volume through accumulated austerity measures and other reductions , depleted its financial reserves and lowered overhead costs to their practical limits , and the projected cumulative gap between expenditure and income would inevitably lead to ruptures in services ;  
As had been recognized in recent major conferences convened by the United Nations , the development of developing countries required a favourable international economic environment including enhanced financial flows , better access to markets in developed countries and access to technology on a non-discriminatory , concessional and preferential basis .  
Despite the commitments made at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development on the provision of new and additional financial resources and the action agreed to within the framework of the follow-up to the Rio Conference and at the World Summit for Social Development with a view to eradicating poverty , levels of official development assistance continued to be on the decline and the target contribution of 0.7 per cent of the gross national product of developed countries had become a virtual chimera .  
Like many developing countries , it was disappointed by the shortage of financial resources and by the developed countries ' failure to contribute , in clear and specific terms , the new and additional financial resources required for the successful implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Despite considerable efforts , the Commission had been unable to balance viewpoints and to catalyse decisive action by the international community , not only on financial resources but also on other cross-sectoral issues such as the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , economic instruments for sustainable development and the relation between international trade and the environment . 
Through dialogue with Member States , through coordination with the United Nations agencies that support human rights efforts , through permanent contact with regional forums , academic institutions and the leadership of the main international financial institutions , the High Commissioner has sought to ensure that the issue of human rights become a constant in the thinking and actions of the political and economic forces that govern or influence events globally .  
In preparation for legislative elections held in June , August and September 1995 and the presidential elections of December 1995 , the technical team coordinated a large civic education programme and undertook , inter alia , the preparation of an electoral budget and coordination of financial support through a United Nations trust fund established for that purpose ; preparation of an operational and logistical plan , and assistance in its implementation ; and support in the design of a communication plan and a deployment plan for registration and voting periods .  
The Committee also agreed with the Secretary-General 's view that efforts to ensure that the United Nations was equipped to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century depended on , above all , continuous , predictable and assured political and financial support from Member States .  
Such education was available at all school levels , starting with municipal and private kindergartens and including both public and private schools maintained by the national minority , which received the same financial support from the State as public schools .  
Also decides that the preparatory process for the special session of the General Assembly should be funded through the regular budget of the United Nations , bearing in mind the need to keep financial costs to a minimum , and that Governments should be invited to make extrabudgetary contributions to meet those costs ;  
In accordance with the recommendations of the General Assembly in paragraph 6 of its resolution 49 / 194 and of the Commission on Human Rights in paragraph 6 of its resolution 1995 / 54 , the High Commissioner , by a letter of 28 August 1995 addressed to all relevant United Nations agencies and financial institutions , has sought to explore possibilities for obtaining from such institutions , acting within their mandates , technical and financial assistance for supporting the Organization 's efforts to promote human rights and the rule of law .  
A sustained commitment of all relevant parts of the United Nations towards increased cooperation under the guidance of the High Commissioner , increased resources for both technical and financial assistance and continued substantive programme development are required in order to provide an effective response to the growing demand by the Member States for cooperation with the United Nations regarding the rule of law .  
However , in spite of donor support and encouragement , progress has been slow in most of these areas for two main reasons : lack of human and financial capacity to manage such complex reforms ; and political sensitivity , which call for broad consultations and negotiations involving Parliament and civil society , thereby further contributing to the complexity of the reform process .  
On the question of limitations of liability ( para . 38 ) , given the substantial increase in the number and amount of third-party claims against the United Nations , the General Assembly might wish to consider , inter alia , financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal liability of the member of the force .  
The establishment of adequate internal controls at an early stage was a key requirement which should be borne in mind for future peacekeeping missions , since it would provide reasonable assurance that financial and administrative matters were properly handled during the life of the mission .  
His delegation supported the continuing decentralization of functions which , in particular , increased managerial responsibility at the local level , and agreed that delegated management authority must be accompanied by delegated financial authority , subject , however , to the overall authority of the Office of Human Resources Management . 
While it was gratifying to note that the percentage of women in posts subject to geographical distribution had risen by 1 per cent over the past year , his delegation was concerned that , because of the financial crisis , it had been difficult for the Organization to meet its targets for the percentage of women in decision-making and policy-making posts .  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
At the regional level , the Economic Commission for Africa played a leading role in assisting Member States in their implementation of the Platform , focusing human and financial resources on enhancing women 's political leadership role and economic empowerment and promoting their legal and human rights .  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Non-Annex I Parties are thus encouraged to formulate cost-effective national , and where appropriate regional , programmes aiming at the improvement of the quality of local emission factors and appropriate data gathering , and to submit requests for financial and technical assistance to the interim operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention in addition to their request for support for the preparation of their initial communications .  
In providing the financial resources needed by developing country Parties to meet the agreed full incremental costs of implementing measures covered by Article 4.1 of the Convention in accordance with Article 4.3 , take steps to facilitate this provision of financial resources , including the enhancement of transparency and the flexible and pragmatic application of its concept of incremental costs on a case-by-case basis ;  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 13 above , their respective share in the amount of 115,373,000 dollars gross ( 113,866,300 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 227,406,878 dollars gross ( 227,911,279 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 December 1995 ;  
The fundamental importance of the law of the sea institutions for international peace and security , the peaceful settlement of disputes , the sustainable development of marine resources and the protection of the environment has allowed them to evolve successfully , despite the increasing financial difficulties for Governments in providing for institutional development at the international level .  
The recommendation was based on the following needs : " ( a ) to better identify priorities for action at the global level to promote conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment ; ( b ) for better coordination among the relevant United Nations organizations and intergovernmental financial institutions ; ( c ) to ensure sound scientific , environmental , economic and social advice on these issues . "  
Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
For , as has also been emphasized by the Acting Chairman of the OAU , how can Africa develop if the financial flows towards the continent decline every day , if official development assistance , which is already declining , is subject to more and more conditions , if the burden of debt continues to increase , if African commodities have difficulty finding access to international markets and if the trend towards reducing investment in our countries is expanding and new capital is still not coming in ?  
The reform and structural adjustment programmes to which African countries are committed have all been multidimensional in nature , including measures for domestic economic and commercial liberalization aimed at improving financial management , expanding the tax base and enhancing efficiency and transparency in the fiscal system .  
In the short term , there was an urgent need for additional financial resources to alleviate human suffering and environmental damage and to find solutions to the political problems that caused population displacements .  
Providing the programme planning , financial , personnel , legal , management , administrative and general services that are essential for the rational selection of work items and allocating resources among them and for the effective , economic and efficient performance of the services and functions of the Secretariat , within the legal framework of regulations , rules and policies adopted by the Assembly .  
He understood that the staff felt threatened and demoralized in the budget climate created by the Organization 's response to its financial crisis , by the renewed emphasis on performance issues , the possibility that the redeployment process and the buy-out programme could lead to involuntary separations , the resignations of some long-term staff , the perception that pay levels were uncompetitive , the high percentage of loaned personnel and the frequent depiction , outside the Organization , of the international civil service as a bloated bureaucracy .  
In this connection , the Government of Burundi also requests , through you , direct proof and circumstantial evidence from the International Commission of Inquiry concerning the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye , which was " planned beforehand " , and concerning the " acts of genocide against the Tutsi minority " , as well as material and financial assistance from the United Nations to strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Justice , which will play a fundamental role in the planned judicial process .  
Despite the negative effect of the financial situation of the United Nations , as pointed out by the Assistant Secretary-General for Public Information , great progress had been made in improving the work of the Department and innovating when implementing its programmes , thanks no doubt to its links with educational institutions , think tanks and national and local governmental institutions , as well as international media organizations .  
LDCs also suffer from an extremely limited internal savings capacity and underdeveloped financial markets , geographical disadvantages ( as in the case of many land-locked and small island LDCs ) , inadequate infrastructure , poor communications and low education levels which are reflected , inter alia , in weak managerial and administrative capacity and in a severe shortage of skilled and trained manpower .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 and 50 / 10 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Invites donor countries and multilateral financial institutions to give high priority to the eradication of poverty in their assistance budgets and programmes , on either a bilateral or multilateral basis , and also invites the relevant funds , programmes and agencies of the United Nations system to support developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , in their efforts to achieve the overall goal of eradicating poverty and ensuring basic social services , through , inter alia , the elaboration and implementation of anti-poverty programmes ;  
Calls upon Governments to invite and encourage the active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , local community groups and the media , as well as financial and non-profit organizations for the implementation of the Platform for Action ;  
The Bank viewed land ownership and natural resources management ; technical assistance and training ; basic investment in education , health and other aspects of human capital that were adapted to indigenous peoples and their cultures ; and better access to goods and services , including financial resources , as closely related factors which warranted special attention in tackling the poverty and marginalization of Latin America 's indigenous people .  
Recommends that the next informal round table be held in the Latin American and Caribbean region to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa so as to be close to the reality and needs of the developing countries , without losing sight of global perspectives , and invites Member States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the regular convening of informal round tables on communication for development , with the full participation of the international financial institutions at the country level ;  
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
In particular , the successful methodology developed in the agricultural sector will be applied to the other sectors with the intention of establishing a fully functional information and progress review mechanism by the beginning of December to be presented to the next consultative group meeting of bilateral and multilateral donors and financial institutions .  
The Heads of State again emphasize the special importance of developing and extracting the rich natural resources of their countries , in the first instance natural gas , petroleum and hydro-energy resources , and called for urgent measures to conduct joint projects for laying pipelines and electricity transmission lines to deliver energy to world markets , with the involvement in these projects of the States concerned , international financial institutions and State and private structures .  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Stresses that the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued through the reallocation of resources already designated for development purposes ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;

INCERA ( Costa Rica ) , speaking on behalf of the Group 77 and China , said that the strengthening of oversight and audit functions was a fundamental means of achieving the efficient , transparent and responsible management of the Organization 's resources , particularly in the light of the current financial crisis .  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Proposals aimed at enhancing broader cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policies among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , as a means of promoting a stable international economic environment conducive to sustained economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
Thus , it should improve and support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development , concentrating on the needs of the population and the eradication of poverty .  
In subprogramme 8.2 , on environment and social development management , it should be mentioned that the lack of financial and technological resources , information and technical knowledge and the debt crisis and unemployment are factors that have a negative impact on the environment and social development , as well as that eradication of poverty is of maximum importance for the developing countries and constitutes a basic condition for attaining sustainable development .  
Decides that the preparatory process for the special session of the General Assembly should be funded through the regular budget of the United Nations , bearing in mind the need to keep financial costs to a minimum , and that Governments should be invited to make extrabudgetary contributions to meet those costs ;  
Emphasizing the importance of cooperation and international solidarity in supporting the efforts being made by the peoples and Governments of Central America for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace , and the need to strengthen the new programme of cooperation and economic , technical and financial assistance for Central America in the light of the new situation in the region ,  
Supports the treatment accorded to Nicaragua in the light of its continuing exceptional circumstances , so that the international community and financial institutions can incorporate that treatment into programmes to support the country 's economic recovery and social reconstruction ;  
With reference to the 20 / 20 initiative embodied in the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , it had been agreed that the initial target was 0.7 per cent of gross national product , and that the ability of the Government of a developing country to devote 20 per cent of its expenditure to basic social services would depend on the level of economic development , its debt burden and other financial commitments .  
He also welcomed the work accomplished by the Special Committee at its most recent session with regard to the formulation of guiding principles for the establishment and conduct of peacekeeping operations and the consideration of practical steps to ensure that future peacekeeping operations would have a sound logistical and financial basis .  
While the primary responsibility for the maintenance of peace and security lay with the United Nations , regional organizations could also make a valuable contribution to facilitating the peaceful resolution of conflicts .  However , regional initiatives , especially in developing countries , had so far been constrained by logistical and financial difficulties .  
His Government reiterated its commitment to work with the United Nations in matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security in the hope that some day all the Organization 's human and financial resources could be devoted to encouraging social development and improving the living conditions of people everywhere .  
It is acknowledged that the Fund of UNDCP requires an operating reserve to ensure the financial viability and integrity of the Fund and to cover : downward fluctuations or shortfalls in resources ; uneven cash flows ; increases in actual costs as compared with planning estimates or fluctuations in delivery ; and contingencies such as final expenditure ( including liquidating liabilities ) and unforeseen needs which may arise .  
Reaffirms the importance of ensuring the uniform and consistent application of the Convention and a coordinated approach to its overall implementation , and of strengthening technical cooperation and financial assistance for this purpose , stresses once again the continuing importance of the Secretary-General 's efforts to these ends , and reiterates its invitation to the competent international organizations and other international bodies to support these objectives ;  
The committee is currently focusing its work on a review of Liberian electoral laws and constitutional provisions ; the establishment of an independent and impartial administrative mechanism for the management of the electoral process ; the role of the international community in the holding of elections ; and the technical , logistic and financial assistance necessary to support the electoral process .  
He commended the Commissioner 's efforts to restructure the Centre for Human Rights and emphasized the need for extensive consideration of that question by Member States and guidance by the General Assembly before action was taken .  The right to development was a fundamental human right and must be fully respected and implemented on a firm financial basis .  
Reports should inter alia indicate the activities and programmes developed in the framework of international cooperation , including at the bilateral and regional levels , the areas addressed , the target groups identified , the financial assistance provided and / or received and the priorities considered , as well as any evaluation made of the progress achieved and of the difficulties encountered .

The Statistical Commission expressed its appreciation for the report of the Task Force ; recognized the importance of finance statistics for economic analysis and policy-making ; and emphasized the need to produce consistent standards on monetary and financial statistics that were harmonized with the concepts of the 1993 SNA .  
In the context of the requirements established for the European Monetary Union , Eurostat and EMI have identified a broad range of actions for financial statistics that include the development of a methodology for monetary statistics clean of cross-border business and reflecting the adoption of harmonized concepts and definitions ( residency , currency breakdown , coverage ) , all within the framework of the European System of Accounts .  
The draft manual on monetary and financial statistics and an annotated outline of the revised Manual on Government Finance Statistics have been sent for comment to national statistical offices ; central banks and ministries of finance of member countries ; international organizations , including members of the Task Force ; and other interested parties .  
Consideration of policies and procedures for the acceptance of gratis personnel can not be separated from the overall financial situation of the Organization and the present environment of increasing demands coupled with growing budgetary constraints , leading programme managers to seek and accept offers of gratis personnel in order to offset declining authorized resources in the implementation of the approved work programme .  
In the area of backstopping of peacekeeping operations ( financed by the peacekeeping support account ) or the start-up of the international tribunals , for instance , the General Assembly had , until recently , agreed only to ad hoc and temporary financial arrangements under which it has been difficult for the Secretariat to recruit staff in a planned and orderly manner .  
The financial liability involved in the acceptance of gratis personnel relates to costs for secretarial and administrative backstopping , equipment , supplies , office space , utilities , communications , legal and medical services , as well as costs for official travel , daily subsistence allowance and participation in United Nations training and language programmes .  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 13 above , their respective share in the amount of 115,373,000 dollars gross ( 113,866,300 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 227,406,878 dollars gross ( 227,911,279 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 December 1995 ;  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 and 50 / 10 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries , 1 .  Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General [ 1 ] on the implementation of resolution 50 / 10 ;  
Urges Member States carefully to consider the problems posed by the international aspects of corrupt practices , especially as regards international economic activities carried out by corporate entities , and to study appropriate legislative and regulatory measures to ensure the transparency and integrity of financial systems and transactions carried out by such corporate entities ;  
Public officials , to the extent required by the officials ' position , shall in accordance with laws or administrative policies , declare business , commercial and financial interests , or activities undertaken for financial gain that may raise a possible conflict of interest .

GORITA ( Romania ) said that partnership , which was the key to the success of the globalization of the world economy , did not mean just partnership between developed and developing countries ; it should encompass all the potential actors involved : intergovernmental organizations , the United Nations funds and programmes , the international financial institutions , employers ' representatives and civil society .  
Noting that the international community had held a series of conferences to address such important issues as human rights , children , women , social development and the environment - to name but a few - he wondered whether it would be prepared to devote the same degree of attention and political commitment to such issues as the external economic environment , transfer of financial resources for development and transfer of technology , all of which were crucial to the development of the developing countries . 
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
His delegation called upon the major Powers to stop providing military , financial and strategic support , as well as direct and indirect financing for the construction of new settlements , since that posed a threat to a just and lasting peace in the region .  
Considering in particular the fact that , in order to respond to those urgent humanitarian needs , the Government of the Comoros , in the absence of other resources , had to reallocate as a matter of great urgency a major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State and the financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes ,  
While Government and other stakeholders have been dedicating resources to the development of new financial instruments to address sustainable forestry , the huge shifts in global capital markets over the last five years suggest that the main issue for capturing private sector funding for forest management is not developing new financial instruments , but linking existing investment flows more directly to sustainability and with sustainable forest management in particular . 
His delegation shared the concern about the dire financial crisis faced by UNRWA and was gratified to note that UNRWA was considering a number of innovative approaches to expand its traditional donor base .  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
Acknowledges the interest in holding the next informal round table in the Latin American and Caribbean region , to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa , and invites interested States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the convening of these informal round tables on communication for development , with the participation of the international financial institutions and the regional banks , at the country level ;  
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring of sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that the implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued at the expense of development resources , inter alia , through contribution by bilateral donors to the Trust Fund for the implementation of the Initiative , and welcomes the commitment made to provide such additional resources and bearing in mind the needs of developing countries as they are being addressed through ongoing development activities ;  
Decides that the preparatory process for the special session of the General Assembly should be funded through the regular budget of the United Nations , bearing in mind the need to keep financial costs to a minimum , and that Governments should be invited to make extrabudgetary contributions to meet those costs . " 
Recommendations and decisions of ICSC or resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly concerning the conditions of service of common system staff were not automatically binding , for the following reasons : the organizations were in different financial and budgetary situations ; staff recruitment and retention difficulties varied ; and each common system organization was an independent and sovereign intergovernmental organization and should have the final word regarding the conditions of service of its staff .  
These included macroeconomic stability , high rates of domestic saving , maintenance of sound financial intermediaries , high priority given to human resource development ( especially to high _ quality primary and secondary education ) , competitive exchange rates , export orientation , a supportive environment which rewarded entrepreneurship and allowed open and constructive dialogue between government and the private sector regarding objectives and policies , and governance which balanced the promotion of social cohesion and consensus with that of competition between individuals and companies .  
The spokesman for the African Group ( Morocco ) said that it was difficult to be optimistic about the possibilities for the African continent to achieve economic and social development , given the negative net external financial flows experienced by the region .  
The end of the recession in the industrial countries had favourably influenced exports from the region , which had also received a considerable inflow of foreign direct investment and other external financial flows , although these had remained concentrated in a few countries .  
In view of the acute external financial constraints and low levels of domestic savings in most African countries , there was a pressing need to improve their capacity to attract foreign investment , in the process drawing investors ' attention to the considerable opportunities existing in all major economic sectors , namely natural resources , agro-industry , other manufacturing , tourism , other services , and infrastructure .  
While such authoritarianism on the political front should not be replicated in other developing countries , the East Asian experience did show the positive role which Governments could play in development by providing not only a good macroeconomic environment but also policies giving appropriate importance to agriculture and basic social services , as well as to the establishment of effective and secure financial systems . 
He called for adequate and timely funding of multilateral financial institutions and organizations which provided a significant part of the LDCs ' external financing and innovative approaches for increasing foreign direct investment ( FDI ) flows to the LDCs .  
In spite of all these setbacks , African countries had pressed ahead with efforts to facilitate the effective development and utilization of human resources , harness their vast natural resources , mobilize both domestic and foreign financial resources for development and strengthen regional and subregional cooperation and integration .  
IFAD was already supporting countries in the early stages of implementing the Convention through the formulation of investment projects at the local level , including projects that attempted to provide an enabling environment in which farmers could help themselves , including the development of rural financial systems , demand-driven technology development , and decentralized institutions for community action .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but that face economic hardship ;  
At the end of the 12-month period provided for in regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the special account until payment is effected ;  
Noting also the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
" Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Stresses that the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda will require an increased commitment of financial resources , both domestically and externally , and in that context calls upon the developed countries to complement the national financial efforts of developing countries on human settlements development and urban management , and intensify their efforts to transfer new and additional resources to the developing countries within the framework of paragraphs 203 and 204 of the Habitat Agenda in order to ensure the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Invites donor countries and multilateral financial institutions to give high priority to the eradication of poverty in their assistance budgets and programmes , on either a bilateral or multilateral basis , and also invites the relevant funds , programmes and agencies of the United Nations system to support developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , in their efforts to achieve the overall goal of eradicating poverty and ensuring basic social services , through , inter alia , the elaboration and implementation of anti-poverty programmes ;  
Recommends that the next informal round table be held in the Latin American and Caribbean region to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa so as to be close to the reality and needs of the developing countries , without losing sight of global perspectives , and invites Member States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the regular convening of informal round tables on communication for development , with the full participation of the international financial institutions at the country level ;  
Acknowledges the interest in holding the next informal round table in the Latin American and Caribbean region , to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa , and invites interested States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the convening of these informal round tables on communication for development , with the participation of the international financial institutions and the regional banks , at the country level ;  
" Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
Calls upon the international community , and financial institutions , including the Global Environment Facility , within the framework of its operational strategy , to support commercial energy development in small island developing States based on environmentally sound renewable sources with demonstrated viability , to support improvement of the efficiency of existing technologies and end-use equipment based on conventional energy sources , and to assist with the financing of investments necessary to expand energy supplies beyond urban areas ;  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter , in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
Significant human and financial resources are being devoted by the international community to assistance in mine clearance , which is , by its nature , a long-term task ; to efficient and effective demining programmes where the primary emphasis is on the development of national mine-clearance capacities by afflicted countries ; to mine-awareness programmes ; and to the rehabilitation and reintegration into society of victims of landmines .  
The maintenance of a significant United Nations presence in Haiti in the form of military elements , particularly against the backdrop of the far more drastic crisis situations in other regions of the world and the extremely difficult financial situation of the Organization , could be perceived as a manifestation of double standards , especially when one takes into account the totally different attitude towards other truly critical and more volatile flashpoints .  
In this regard , operative paragraph 4 of today 's draft resolution ( S / 1996 / 1002 ) is essential because close cooperation between the Government of Haiti and international financial institutions is expected to permit the mobilization of additional financial support to assist the economic , social and institutional development which is so needed for Haiti to weather the winds of instability .  
Botswana has always maintained that the international community must always aim at ensuring that the financial , material and human resources invested in the cause of peace do not go to waste due to premature withdrawal of a peacekeeping mission .  
" Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
" Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Stresses that the implementation of the heavily indebted poor countries initiative requires additional financial resources from both bilateral and multilateral creditors and therefore should not be pursued through the reallocation of resources already designated for development purposes ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way to the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Proposals aimed at enhancing broader cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policies among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , as a means of promoting a stable international economic environment conducive to sustained economic growth , particularly in developing countries ;  
" Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
Considering in particular the fact that , in order to respond to those urgent humanitarian needs , the Government of the Comoros , in the absence of other resources , had to reallocate as a matter of great urgency a major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State and the financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes ,  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,202,700 United States dollars gross ( 973,100 dollars net ) for the period from 1 December 1994 to 30 November 1995 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 10,556,600 United States dollars gross ( 8,783,400 dollars net ) for the period from 1 February 1995 to 31 January 1996 ;  
Firmly upholds the validity of the principles cited in comparable situations by certain Governments which imposed the embargo against Burundi , namely , that the imposition on a State of an economic , commercial or financial blockade also has adverse consequences for the sovereignty and interests of other countries and that the imposition of one State 's jurisdiction on another State is contrary to the principles of international law ;  
Once again solemnly appeals to the community of States , the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to redouble their commitment and take further initiatives to mobilize the political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources needed to end the Burundian crisis definitively and , thereby , to bring these collective efforts to fruition in a genuine national reconciliation of the Burundian people ;  
Kenya shares the legitimate concerns of many Member States regarding the need to minimize the operational costs of the institutions we have created and to adopt an evolutionary and cost-effective approach that takes into account the increasing financial difficulties of Governments in providing for institutional development at the international level .  We believe , however , that it is crucial for the international community to provide these new institutions with sufficient resources to enable them to discharge their important functions .  
Regarding the financial aspects of this project , it is anticipated that although the revised project cost of construction will exceed the amount approved by the General Assembly in its resolution 45 / 248 A of 21 December 1990 , the additional requirement , excluding claims , could be covered , with the approval of the General Assembly , by interest earned on the construction-in-progress funds and , therefore , no additional appropriation would be required under the regular budget beyond the amount of $ 107,576,900 originally approved .  
Provision of legal , social , financial and material assistance to victims of trafficking ( physical and psychological rehabilitation , professional retraining , provision of shelter , lawyers , hot-line services , medical aid , assistance in contacts with the police , embassies , etc . ) as well as to their families ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,202,700 United States dollars gross ( 973,100 dollars net ) for the period from 1 December 1994 to 30 November 1995 ;  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force , there shall be set off against their future apportionments their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 10,556,600 United States dollars gross ( 8,783,400 dollars net ) for the period from 1 February 1995 to 31 January 1996 ;  
Firmly upholds the validity of the principles cited in comparable situations by certain Governments which imposed the embargo against Burundi , namely , that the imposition on a State of an economic , commercial or financial blockade also has adverse consequences for the sovereignty and interests of other countries and that the imposition of one State 's jurisdiction on another State is contrary to the principles of international law ;  
Once again solemnly appeals to the community of States , the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to redouble their commitment and take further initiatives to mobilize the political , diplomatic , human , economic , financial and material resources needed to end the Burundian crisis definitively and , thereby , to bring these collective efforts to fruition in a genuine national reconciliation of the Burundian people ;  
While retaining its great ability for political and financial mobilization and intensive , joint work with Governments , UNICEF , under the excellent leadership of Ms . Carol Bellamy , and with a renewed mandate , is focusing on supporting Government efforts to settle outstanding issues , consolidate the gains that it has already achieved and work more effectively to meet present and future challenges . 
The Panel recognized that in developing countries domestic resources for the financing , management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forest are scarce and international financial sources remain vital .  
The Panel recognized that there is a need to promote new and innovative forms of finance and [ combine ] [ complement ] [ facilitate ] all forms of finance , at the public , private , international , domestic and local levels and to combine them with existing ones , as well as to ensure the predictability and continuity of flow of financial resources .  
Invited [ [ UNDP and the World Bank to take the lead ] [ the Bretton Woods institutions ] , together with other ] relevant international organizations , to further explore [ innovative ways to use existing financial mechanisms more effectively and ] [ possibilities ] to generate additional forest-specific public and private financial resources at [ the domestic as well as at ] the international level .  
Encouraged [ countries to explore ] [ exploration of ] the feasibility of innovative financial packages , such as [ special ] [ voluntary ] [ partnerships for forests ] [ partnerships for SFM ] , [ based on pooled resources ] [ supporting [ comprehensive forest programmes ] [ national forest programmes ] ] , through further study and national pilot programmes ;  
The Panel also noted that assessments represented a significant financial and technical burden , in particular for developing countries , and that they should [ therefore be carried out in the most cost-effective manner ] [ be assisted by developed countries and international organizations in terms of financial resources and technological transfer ] .  
The Panel recognized the importance of the [ global ] services provided by forests relating to , for example , biological diversity and climate [ change ] [ regulation ] , and the potential for developing mechanisms to translate these values into [ financial support ] [ monetary terms ] to encourage forest [ owners ] [ dwellers , indigenous populations and local communities ] to [ conserve and ] sustainably manage forests .  
The Panel agreed that [ existing or any future body of ] [ any future ] international forest-related legal mechanism [ s ] must deal cohesively with all the interrelated social , economic , trade , environment , development , production , financial and technology issues and have a concrete impact on the future successful implementation of [ sustainable forest management ] [ management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests ] worldwide .  
Educational materials developed at the international and regional levels should benefit from the review and input of national focal points and national resource and training centres and should be made available to national and local programmes for translation , cultural adaptation , testing and revision , with the financial and technical assistance of international and regional programmes .  
Under the coordination of the High Commissioner and the respective national focal points for human rights education , and according to the plan developed following the survey , Governments and national non-governmental organizations , universities and institutes , will be called upon to carry out translation , publication and distribution of appropriate versions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , with technical and financial assistance from international organizations and programmes , where necessary .  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
The Conference identified as a major catalyst the political will of the leadership to champion the cause of scientific and technological development in Africa and to provide it with appropriate policies , financial and other resources and an enabling environment .  
The commitment of the developed countries to ensure an adequate flow of financial resources and the transfer of environmentally sound technology , which were crucial in order for the developing countries to implement Agenda 21 , had been left unfulfilled .  
While expressing its full support for UNDCP , his delegation was greatly concerned by the attitude taken towards that body by some donor countries , and stressed that countries with a high level of domestic consumption of illicit drugs should continue to bear a fair share of the increasing financial burden of UNDCP .  
Emphasizing the importance of cooperation and international solidarity in supporting the efforts being made by the peoples and Governments of Central America for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace , and the need to strengthen the new programme of cooperation and economic , technical and financial assistance for Central America in the light of the new situation in the region ,  
Supports the treatment accorded to Nicaragua in the light of its continuing exceptional circumstances , so that the international community and financial institutions can incorporate that treatment into programmes to support the country 's economic recovery and social reconstruction ;  
Welcomes the recent initiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions , including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and the ongoing process at the international level regarding debt relief , as appropriate , for developing countries , and calls upon the international community , including international financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives that will contribute to a durable solution of the debt problems of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to achieve social development ;  
Thus , it should support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development .  
Since some countries faced financial constraints in that regard , his delegation wholeheartedly supported the proposal contained in the draft resolution prepared by the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee that a special fund should be established to finance the participation of representatives from low-income developing countries .  
The participation of international financial institutions or export credit agencies may facilitate the project sponsors task of raising funds in the international financial market by providing commercial banks with protection against a variety of political risks , including , inter alia , the failure of the host Government to make agreed payments , to make available sufficient foreign exchange or to grant necessary regulatory approvals . 
Moreover , at a time of increasing demand but decreasing resources within the United Nations for international action , the potential of regional groups to contribute political , diplomatic , financial , material and military resources has taken on even greater importance . 
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .  
Thus , it should support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development .  
Thus , while the Advisory Panel has traditionally met once a month , it recently agreed to meet twice monthly , one meeting to address immediate and ongoing management and financial issues and the other meeting to be devoted to discussions of major policy issues and the development of strategic directives .  
The Committee heard an oral representation by the representative of Kyrgyzstan , in which reference was made to the serious financial difficulties of Kyrgyzstan , its over-assessment under the current scale of assessment and the necessity to sustain at least a minimum level of social provision .  
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
Such comprehensive and balanced reform should be constructed on three pillars , that is , reform in the political area , including the Security Council , reform in the economic area , especially on development , and reform in the financial area , focusing on how truly fair and equitable methods of financing the activities of the Organization are to be realized .  
That exclusion was largely acceptable because insolvencies of financial services institutions usually required prompt and discrete action ( for instance to avoid massive withdrawals of deposits ) and were , for that reason , administered under special regulatory regimes in various States .  
Subsequently , the Commission adopted resolution 1997 / 10 , entitled " Effects on the full enjoyment of human rights of the economic adjustment policies arising from foreign debt and , in particular , on the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development " , in which it requested the Secretary-General to submit to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session , after high-level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies and intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon .  
As a result of our examination , we are of the opinion that the financial statements present fairly the financial position of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research as at 31 December 1996 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the financial period then ended ; that they were prepared in accordance with the stated accounting policies which were applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding financial period , and that the transactions were in accordance with the Financial Regulations and the relevant legislative authority . 
In respect of such currencies , the financial statements prepared at such intervals as may be prescribed by the Controller under delegation of authority from the Under-Secretary-General for Administration and Management shall reflect the cash , investments , unpaid pledges and current accounts receivable and payable in currencies other than United States dollars , translated at the applicable United Nations rates of exchange in effect as at the date of the statements .  
In the interests of prudent financial management , up to half of the value of conditional pledges from Governments and firm pledges made by organizations of established repute are recognized as income at the time the pledge is received .  
To transform the Gambia into a financial centre , a tourist paradise , a trading export-oriented agricultural and manufacturing nation , thriving on free market policies and a vibrant private sector , sustained by a well-educated , trained , skilled , healthy , self-reliant and enterprising population , and guaranteeing a well-balanced ecosystem and a decent standard of living for one and all , under a system of government based on the consent of the citizenry .  
We must therefore concentrate our efforts on the causes , such as poverty , armed conflicts , economic sanctions , economic imbalances , ethnic conflicts , environmental problems , desertification , deforestation , inadequate international cooperation and , above all , the problems of indebtedness , technology transfers , the provision of international financial aid to developing countries and the exploitation of basic resources and unfair terms of trade , all of which lead to greater flows of refugees across international borders , as the current international situation shows .  
We have taken measures to consolidate parliamentary democracy through constitutional means ; to restore financial equilibrium through austerity and structural adjustments while enhancing business incentives and economic liberalization ; to combat corruption , drugs and terrorism which is often sponsored from abroad through effective law enforcement and speedy and fair justice .  
The fact that we have been able to emerge with dignity from the most critical phase in our independent development is , to a large extent , to the credit of the United Nations and its specialized agencies , which provided Georgia not only with moral support but with specific and timely financial and technical assistance . 
And for peace to be truly meaningful it must also be translated into concrete improvements in the living conditions of the long-suffering Palestinian people ; hence , there is an urgent need for economic , financial and technical assistance by the international community .  
Mr . Galu \ x { ea98 } a ( Czech Republic ) : Although the Czech Republic , as an associated country , endorsed the statement of the European Union presented by the representative of Luxembourg , I would like to make a few additional comments on this point .  The reason is that the situation in the former Yugoslavia , specifically in Bosnia and Herzegovina , is a long-term priority of Czech foreign policy , reflected in our intensive political , military , material and financial support for all efforts to bring stability to the region .  
It is relevant here to highlight the need for the international community to continue its cooperation with the Central American countries by providing the required economic , financial and technical assistance in sustained fashion and on favourable terms in order to make the goals of the programme of sustainable development in Central America achievable .  
Emphasizes the importance of supporting and strengthening the new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities laid down in the new sustainable development programme for the region .  
We would like first and foremost to express our gratitude to those States and international organizations that have continued to provide financial and material support to Djibouti , particularly those that participated in and made pledges during the round table on Djibouti held at Geneva in May 1997 .  
The international community is devoting considerable human and financial resources to assistance in mine clearing , which by its very nature is a long-term job ; to efficient mine clearance programmes in which the primary emphasis needs to be on helping the afflicted countries to develop national mine clearance capability ; to mine-awareness programmes ; and to the rehabilitation and reintegration into society of landmine victims .  
The achievement of that critical objective must of necessity be accompanied by a concomitant technological and financial commitment by the international community to accelerate the pace of the demining operations already under way and of all those that can not be implemented because of lack of sufficient resources .  
Regional and international arms races and military expenditure do not merely threaten international peace and security and the stability of States ; they also absorb tremendous amounts of national economic and financial resources , particularly in the developing countries that so sorely need those resources to achieve their aspirations to economic and social development .  
National mechanisms for control of the production and marketing of light weapons , and the elimination of illicit trafficking , need to be harmonized at the international level with a view to achieving effective financial control without duplication of procedures and needless bureaucratization .  
Developed countries and the international community at large , including relevant United Nations organizations , are urged to assist developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , including through technical cooperation and financial assistance , in their efforts to improve the ability and the competitive capacity to participate in global economic development and alleviate unemployment .  
The Commission calls upon Governments and the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and to use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including on concessional and grant terms .  
Copper prices , additionally , lost considerable ground after disclosures of substantial losses by a large Japanese company in trades of derivative financial instruments linked to copper , amid widely publicized speculation that the company controlled large unreported stocks of copper that had been used to manipulate market prices and prices of the derivative instruments .  
Nevertheless , the prudent advice for policy makers in capital-importing countries would be , first , to seek to build and retain investor confidence through their own cautious macroeconomic policy-making and , second , to remember that international financial markets can become highly volatile and subject to herd instincts and thus capable of moving vast volumes of funds out of , as well as into , countries on short notice .  
Since countries each have different relative strengths and all have limited financial means , considerable benefit can be realized from sharing international efforts to develop resource and environmental accounting concepts and methods .  
Typically : host institution may not benefit from widespread local support ; staff may be divided as to advisability of foreign assistance ; there may be solid resistance to necessary change ; circumstances ( financial and material ) may be poor and so on .  
At the same time the Commission further defined the mandate of the expert by requesting him to coordinate his efforts with other international actors in the field , to prepare a comprehensive plan concerning the excavation of mass graves and the exhumation of mortal remains , and to assume responsibility for securing appropriate support , including financial assistance , for these tasks .  
Weak technological infrastructures , a severe shortage of qualified human resources and limited financial means explain in part the persistent nature of the problem confronting many developing countries .  
In this sense , international cooperation , including financial and technical support , is a duty of States in the context of the HIV / AIDS epidemic and industrialized countries are encouraged to act in a spirit of solidarity in assisting developing countries to meet the challenges of implementing the Guidelines .  
One year after D + 60 , beneficiaries of both procedures shall become eligible for longer-term services provided by the Government , including financial , technical , legal and employment assistance and assistance in the areas of education , training and production projects with a view to ensuring their lasting integration into the economic , social and cultural life of the country , on the same terms as the rest of the Guatemalan population .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and inadequate access to technologies may hinder implementation and compliance with international legal instruments .  
Factors contributing to this deficiency include lack of political will , unavailability of sufficient financial means , lack of full understanding of the exact obligations of the instrument , and the compressed time schedule of many negotiations , which may leave room for multiple interpretations of the agreed text , and this may give rise to potential disputes .  
For example , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific and the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia both reported that several countries in their region expressed strong concerns regarding their problems in the implementation of and compliance with conventions due to the administrative burden imposed , and the lack of institutional and technical capacities and financial resources .  
The Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1993 / 14 , requested the Secretary _ General to prepare basic policy guidelines on structural adjustment and economic , social and cultural rights which could serve as a basis for a continued dialogue between human rights bodies and the international financial institutions .  
It is also necessary to facilitate multi and bilateral technical and financial cooperation with Cuba which can enable its Government and people to continue on the path of the economic reforms in progress and to undertake , on a consensual basis , the political reforms which are urgently called for by the current situation , in particular with respect to human rights .  
To realize the concrete and achievable goals clearly set out by the Conference , the mobilization of resources must be placed high on the global development agenda , and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
It will also include continuing financial contributions to the international community 's variegated activities in the humanitarian and economic and social fields , without which it will not be possible to restore lasting peace and security in the region .  
Many countries ( which have suffered and continue to suffer great material and financial damage as a result of sanctions ) are therefore completely justified in their desire to elaborate basic criteria and conditions for the application and implementation of mandatory sanctions , and develop ways and means of preventing the adverse consequences of such sanctions or , at least , reducing them to a minimum .  
Both national and international non-governmental organizations also feel that their growing role and contribution in environmental and other economic and social fields is not matched by equal growth in financial , political and technical support from Governments and international organizations .  
Although there are numerous examples of good practices by business and industry , the number of companies that are making strides in becoming sustainable development enterprises is small relative to the global total , a disappointing trend given that business and industry is the single most dominant factor influencing the direction of investments and financial flows , as well as the type of products produced and the processes with which they are made . 
The response of individual organizations of the United Nations system to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 's sustainable development agenda is assessed in terms of the three basic functions of intergovernmental organizations : ( a ) policy development , ( b ) the collection , synthesis , analysis and dissemination of data and information to inform action at all levels and ( c ) the delivery of technical and financial support to strengthen human and institutional capabilities at national and regional levels .  
Those mechanisms will have to be established in a broad and realistic manner , with the help of international cooperation , and will have to cover not only financial compensation but also measures to support and assist those families and communities which suffered the worst consequences of the internal armed conflict .  
Through its special hardship programme , UNRWA provided material and financial aid to refugee families who met the UNRWA criteria of being without a male adult medically fit to earn an income and without other financial support sufficient to cover basic needs , which represented 5.4 per cent of the registered refugee population .  
This national undertaking calls for an implementation strategy that sets realistic priorities for gradual fulfilment of the various aspects of the Peace Agreements as and when the political , institutional , financial and technical bases for their implementation are established ,  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
It should be noted that , for the purposes of the present exercise , all official development finance committed for development assistance is assumed to be dedicated to sustainable development , so that analysis focuses on any changes in the allocation of financial assistance among the economic , social and environmental components of sustainable development that may have been made in response to the series of global conferences beginning with the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and other determinants of aid composition .  
In response it was noted that the adjective " financial " had a narrow meaning in a number of legal systems , as related to transactions with currency , securities or stocks in the financial market .  Also the adjective " commercial " , which was used in some legal systems to refer to transactions covered by a particular body of law sometimes referred to as " commercial law " , might be interpreted as excluding certain categories of debtors whose transactions were not qualified as " commercial affairs " in those legal systems .  
The project has six immediate objectives : ( a ) increased awareness and improved understanding of the money-laundering phenomenon and acceptance of the need for countermeasures ; ( b ) introduction of relevant legislation , inter alia , promoting mutual legal assistance ; ( c ) improved global infrastructure , including the delivery of training services ; ( d ) improved capacity of legal and related law enforcement systems , including the establishment of financial intelligence units or similar bodies ; ( e ) reduced financial system vulnerability ; and ( f ) improved process of performance evaluation .  
This acknowledgement is given concrete meaning through the incorporation of the legal principle of common but differentiated responsibility in paragraph 4 of article 20 , which makes the obligations and commitments of developing countries contingent upon the effective implementation by developed country Parties of their commitments under the Convention related to financial resources and transfer of technology .  This overriding priority is apparent in every aspect of the development and implementation of the Convention 's principles .  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Welcomes the recent initiatives of the Bretton Woods institutions , including the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and the ongoing process at the international level regarding debt relief , as appropriate , for developing countries , and calls upon the international community , including international financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives that will contribute to a durable solution of the debt problems of developing countries , in particular African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to achieve social development ;  
In particular , the country had witnessed during the war forms of crimes that , given their sophistication and the means employed , were classified as organized criminal activities , in particular illicit trafficking in stolen cars , passing of counterfeit banknotes , mostly United States dollars and deutsche mark , and suspicious financial transactions that were considered to cover up money - laundering schemes .  
Particularly relevant was the legislation enacted to control money-laundering and criminal assets in general , which included a broad number of criminal activities whose revenues were to be disguised through money-laundering schemes , the reversal of the onus probandi as to the source of the assets for those who were sentenced for one of the crimes covered by the law and the obligation for financial institutions to report any suspect transaction to the competent authorities .  
Major criminal activities in which organized transnational crime was engaged were violent behaviour and the use of bribery , graft and extortion that could lead to the subversion of the political , social and economic infrastructure , drug trafficking , terrorist activities , kidnapping , prostitution , counterfeiting of currencies , manipulation of financial institutions and markets , international money-laundering and financial fraud , arms smuggling , alien smuggling and computer crime .  
His Government welcomed new mechanisms for funding and for improved financial management and supported the current reforms of the administrative and financial structure which had the potential to alleviate the financial burdens of the Organization . However , the objective of the reform must be to improve performance ; the downsizing of the Secretariat must be designed to make it more efficient and less bureaucratic and should not lead to any impairment of its effectiveness .  
A number of members of the Committee expressed concern that in the current situation of dwindling financial resources throughout the United Nations system , there was a tendency in many organizations to cut the funding for public information activities , as public information work was difficult to define in quantitative terms .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends but that face economic hardship ;  
Although more countries are adopting the programme approach , constraints identified in the UNDP 1996 internal assessment included : ( a ) a lack of clarity and training in the subject ; ( b ) the complexity of the instrument , including procedures for financial management ; ( c ) a lack of guidance on how Governments should evaluate their own programmes and conduct capacity assessments in the public sector and civil society ; ( d ) the need to harmonize procedures of donors at country level .  
The new UNDP structure will reflect an effort to recognize three distinct components or functions : headquarters , being those units whose functions concentrate on organizational policy , global advocacy , management oversight and quality control and global resource mobilization ; operating units , comprising the country offices and the regional bureaux ; and common administrative and financial services .  
This unique financial arrangement has enabled UNDP / PAPP to finance its staff of 125 , largely composed of highly skilled Palestinian technical , engineering and programming professionals , and enhanced by tapping the Junior Professional Officer ( JPO ) Programme , thanks to funding received from a number of bilateral donors .  IX .  
UNCTAD provides inputs to annual reports prepared under the leadership of DESIPA to the Second Committee of the General Assembly and to the Economic and Social Council ( recurrent reports : external debt , net flows and transfer of resources between developing and developed countries , global financial integration , and integration of economies in transition into the world economy ; non-recurrent publications : various , depending upon the agenda ) . 
That resolution reaffirmed the priority of the Programme ( para . 3 ) , requested the Secretary-General to strengthen it further by providing it with the resources necessary for the full implementation of its mandate ( para . 6 ) , called upon States and United Nations and other international , regional and national funding agencies to make significant financial contributions for operational activities of the Programme , and encouraged all States to make voluntary contributions for that purpose to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Fund .  
The role of IMF was to foster fiscal consolidation ; firm anti _ inflationary policies , liberalization of financial sectors and pursuit of a realistic exchange rate ; opening up of the economy to international trade , foreign capital and competition ; price liberalization ; and public enterprise reform . a world economy dominated by the rich industrialized countries . 
The general basis for securing sustainable development is the presence of adequate institutions , knowledge , skills and access to technology and financial resources , which will need to converge in the design and demonstration of sustainable - that is , responsible in a long-term perspective - ways of managing the environment , producing goods and services , meeting basic needs , and improving the economic and social standards of living for the world as a whole , especially for the poorest communities . 
The Trust Fund so established is open to voluntary financial contributions from States , inter-governmental organizations , regional economic integration organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations as well as natural and juridical persons .  
While recognizing that forest land rehabilitation would be required in many areas and that that would need international assistance , including financial resources and technology transfer to support local and national efforts , the Panel emphasized the need for prevention , rather than mitigation and restoration , wherever practicable , with emphasis on improved and sustainable management of existing natural forest and other vegetation .  
The Panel recognized that in developing countries , domestic resources for financing the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forest are scarce and international financial sources remain vital .  
It reiterated the need for external support through ODA and the provision of new and additional financial resources , and emphasized the need to mobilize new , innovative and additional forms of finance at the public , private , international , domestic and local levels .  
However , while recognizing the important potential in innovative financial packages and new types of public-private partnerships , the Panel emphasized the continuing importance of international public finance and of existing commitments to it , and the need to promote the predictability and continuity of flow of financial resources .  
Efforts in developing countries to secure additional financial resources and technology at domestic level need to be strengthened , and should be supplemented from international sources .  
The Panel agreed that forest-related international , regional and bilateral agencies and organizations , existing legal instruments , financial and trade institutions and treaty bodies should mobilize their respective strengths and capacities in implementing the proposals for action in the Panel 's report , and should further promote policy dialogue , consensus-building and international cooperation , recalling Agenda 21 and paragraph 10 of the Forest Principles .  
The Panel agreed that in order to achieve the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests it is necessary to deal coherently with all the interrelated social , cultural , economic , trade , environment , development , production , financial and technology issues that have a concrete impact on those objectives .  
The extent and shape of the international presence in Haiti following the withdrawal of UNSMIH will necessarily be based on the careful consideration of such factors as the degree of professionalization of the HNP ; the security situation as it relates to the ability of the HNP to carry out its mandate ; the state of the Haitian economy ; the commitment of the Government to promoting national reconciliation ; domestic political support for continued international presence ; and the financial and other constraints facing the United Nations .  
Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
Taking into consideration the modest financial capabilities of the State , in this short period it has been impossible to supply the appropriate equipment and arms for the armed forces of the Republic of Macedonia at a level that would provide for an appropriate initial reaction or a possible urgent military action ;  
Noting with regret the negative effects of the structural adjustment and reform policies conceived and imposed by the international financial organizations and bilateral creditors on the debtor countries to deal with the effects of the foreign debt , on the enjoyment and realization of economic , social and cultural rights , especially among the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market access , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of financial resources and better access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Emphasizes the need for new flows of financial resources to the indebted developing countries , and urges the creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase financial assistance on favourable terms as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms , combating poverty , and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Requests the Secretary _ General to submit to the Commission , at its fifty _ fourth session , after high _ level consultations with Governments , international financial institutions and specialized agencies , and with intergovernmental organizations , a report on the international debt strategy containing an analysis of the effects of this phenomenon on the effective enjoyment of human rights of the people of the developing countries , and in particular of the most vulnerable and low _ income groups ;  
The development of exportable health services is seen as a means of : ( a ) generating the resources required to reduce the financial pressure of the fiscal deficit created by the need to grant universal health care coverage ; ( b ) improving infrastructure ( hospital facilities and other complementary structures ) by utilizing the resources resulting from serving foreign demand ; and ( c ) upgrading technological capacities with a direct impact on the national health system which can be assimilated into and / or adapted to the existing human resources infrastructure .  
In paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 50 / 97 , the Secretary-General is requested to convene another meeting of governmental experts from land-locked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems in the land-locked and transit developing countries with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating specific action-oriented measures [ 1 ] .  
First of all , in the view of ACC members , the report does not take sufficient account of the broad variety of NGOs , whose roles , operational procedures and financial requirements are quite different , ranging from large international organizations to national support NGOs and representative peoples ' organizations .  
With regard to the financial management of resources devoted to NGOs , ACC members agree with the need for a better accounting and reporting procedure , however they are not convinced that the resulting ability to produce comparative statistics will be particularly useful , since the operating budgets of organizations and agencies are very different and their individual needs in terms of cooperation with NGOs are fully adapted to their respective roles and mandates .  
The elements of macroeconomic balance and stability , such as inflation , fiscal deficits and current account deficits ( which reflect the gap between domestic savings and investment ) are widely acknowledged to affect foreign trade and external financial inflows through their effects on interest rates , exchange rates , rates of return on investments and credit ratings , among others .  Sources : ESCAP , 1995 ESCAP Population Data Sheet ( Bangkok , 1995 ) ; United Nations , World Population Prospects : The 1994 Revision ( United Nations publication , Sales No .  
Their economic and social achievements have raised their international credit standing to such a degree that it induces very substantial private investment and financial flows .  
Considering the crucial importance of financial investigations designed to target the wealth of organized crime and thereby deprive it of one of the most important means of its power , the working group agreed that measures could be implemented to detect and monitor the physical transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments at the border , subject to strict safeguards to ensure proper use of information thereby obtained and without impeding in any way the freedom of movement of legitimate capital .  
Twelve reports on finance for development ; global financial integration and the strengthening of collaboration between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions , in particular IMF ( two ) ; external debt crisis and development ( two ) ; sustainable development and international economic cooperation : implementation and follow-up to major consensus agreements on development ; financing of development , including net transfer of resources between developed and developing countries ; and overall socio-economic perspective of the world economy ;  
Mr . van Boven was requested to submit , without financial implications , in time for the Sub _ Commission 's consideration at its forty _ eighth session , a revised set of proposed basic principles and guidelines on remedies in the light of existing relevant international instruments , taking into account the new comments received from States and intergovernmental organizations and non _ governmental organizations , as well as the relevant sections of the report of the working group on the administration of justice and the question of compensation .  
In its decision 1996 / 117 , the Sub _ Commission decided to request Mr . Osman El _ Hajj to prepare , without financial implications , an expanded working paper on ways and means of promoting democracy , how democracy can ensure economic , social , cultural and political rights and how to overcome obstacles to democracy , and to present the expanded working paper to the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to promote regional economic cooperation by identifying and addressing major development issues and regional concerns and priorities in trade , investment , financial , information technology , industrial and technological areas , and recommend policy options and measures to achieve tangible results and enhance national capacities to meet new challenges .  
To realize the concrete and achievable goals set out by the International Conference on Population and Development , the mobilization of resources , both domestic and external , must be placed high on the global development agenda and the implications of increasing financial resources to the level of $ 17-billion by the year 2000 , as called for in the Programme of Action , must be faced squarely .  
Recognizing that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential in achieving sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , and that North-South and South-South transfer of environmentally sound technologies is essential for sustainable development , and recognizing also that the fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their sustainable development requirements has not materialized ,  
Also considering that in spite of the commitments made at Rio by the industrialized countries to facilitate transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries and to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , the progress has been very disappointing ,  
Emphasize that trade and environment policies should be mutually supportive in a manner that contributes to sustained economic growth and that positive measures such as financial flows , technical and technological assistance are preferable to trade measures for tackling environmental measures ;  
Strongly urge the developed countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance immediately ;  
In any event , the conditions under which social services are provided must be determined by the State and reflect the rights of citizens , not simply be the result of a private contractual relation between individuals and private firms .  30 .  The State must reclaim the central role in the formulation of public policies , which it sometimes has lost to the private sector and international financial institutions .  
The United Nations should promote regional information-sharing among local and regional governments - e.g . , through regional United Nations workshops and seminars for regional government executives and through the actual involvement of financial managers in the budgetary process and simulation programmes .  Successful cases of programmes in which unregistered entrepreneurs are encouraged to migrate into the small-business sector , should be shared through the United Nations with other developing countries .  
Despite the advances that have been registered in the processes of national reconstruction and development , on which I shall be submitting a separate report to the General Assembly pursuant to the request contained in Assembly resolution 50 / 58 C of 12 December 1995 , the technical and financial assistance of the international community remains necessary .  
Inability on the part of UNOPS to meet administrative costs or to respond to the financial consequences of extraordinary or unanticipated contingencies could result in claimant demands that alternative financing arrangements be placed before the Executive Board , including that responsibility be shared with or assumed by UNDP , the United Nations , or other UNOPS clients .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 9 above , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 87,793,328 dollars gross ( 92,251,479 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1996 ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina until payment is effected .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would indeed have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti until payment is effected .  
The Committee noted that while the shift in emphasis from the concept man as breadwinner that underpinned current welfare reforms was intended to give women autonomy and reduce humiliating financial dependence , it was concerned that those reforms posed real risks for women who had been homemakers , and not part of the paid workforce , or whose careers had been interrupted by childcare and other responsibilities and for older women who had little earning capacity .  
An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
A prominent example is the sensitive investment climate , which had begun to stabilize in 1995 following the adoption of a Law for the Promotion of Investment , the consolidation of the local banking system and related regulatory and institutional developments .  [ 1 ] / Events on the ground since 1996 have prompted caution on the part of investors and financial institutions , that remain in need of sustained political , legal and institutional stability .  
UNCTAD 's mission , fielded in 1996 , was particularly focused on an investigation of : ( i ) the system and procedures currently adopted for the generation of customs and trade data ; ( ii ) technical , financial and logistical requirements for introducing systems aimed at improving customs administration , collection of customs revenues and compilation of comprehensive trade data ; and , ( iii ) other related aspects of customs administration , including the feasibility of computerization in customs administration and eventual installation of the Automated System for Customs Data ( ASYCUDA ) .  
The study deals with : a review of major recent developments affecting private investment , including the regulatory framework , policy environment , trade and financial regimes and their recent performance ; an examination of the main supportive capacities and services important for private investment ; analysis of the scale , composition and impact of private investment in the economy ; and , prospects and policy options relevant to the future direction and magnitude of private investment in the Palestinian territory .  
Affirming the link between peace and development , noting that significant international assistance is indispensable for sustainable development in Haiti , and stressing that a sustained commitment by the international community and the international financial institutions to assist and support the economic , social and institutional development in Haiti is indispensable for long-term peace and security in the country ,  
The international community must continue to provide technical , economic and financial assistance to support political stability , balanced development , the establishment of democratic institutions and respect for human rights .  
Affirming the link between peace and development , noting that significant international assistance is indispensable for sustainable development in Haiti , and stressing that a sustained commitment by the international community and the international financial institutions to assist and support the economic , social and institutional development in Haiti is indispensable for long-term peace and security in the country ,  
At a broad level , technical assistance , complemented by adequate financial support , should be provided to the least developed countries through the common and coordinated efforts of all donors , including international organizations such as WTO , UNCTAD , ITC , UNDP , the World Bank and IMF .  
It is based on the contributions requested by the Division for the Advancement of Women , which focused on additional action taken by the relevant entities in support of the implementation of the Platform for Action since the submission of the previous report of the Secretary-General on the subject ( A / 51 / 322 ) and on means of implementation , including new human resources , financial means and structural changes .  
The operation in Albania was a unique multinational intervention in the sense that the situation in the country , as grave as it was , was one of internal unrest sparked by financial crisis , not the usual kind of armed conflict between opposing sides which the Security Council most often deals with .  
Also appeals to the international community to provide its material , technical and financial support to the non _ governmental organizations and to the groups that are working with dedication to achieve the total elimination of this cultural practice that is harmful for girl children and women ;  
Decides to authorize Ms . Ferero Ucros to prepare , without financial implications , a working paper , in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms , assessing the utility , scope and structure of a study on weapons of mass destruction or with indiscriminate effect , or of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering .  
A further challenge to effective enforcement and regulatory procedures to counter money-laundering is posed by the growth of payment facilities , based on high technology , that enable global financial transactions to be made by coded electronic means .  
The main body of the report shall be comprehensive , informative and analytical in a way that will allow Member States to examine and assess , inter alia , through the debate on the report , the extent to which mandates given by the General Assembly have been fulfilled , as well as to set priorities in the context of the major political , economic and social , administrative and financial issues on its agenda .  
For example , consider the launching of programmes by Governments , United Nations agencies and other international organizations , and major groups , on which consensus was developed by IPF ; consider appropriate mechanisms for the mobilization of institutional , human and financial resources and capacity-building ; and encourage the development of voluntary codes of conduct for the private sector ;  
Consider the feasibility of establishing an international fund to support activities for sustainable forest management ; and explore innovative ways both to use existing financial mechanisms more effectively and to generate new and additional public and private financial resources ;  
Also appeals to the international community to provide its material , technical and financial support to the non _ governmental organizations and to the groups that are working with dedication to achieve the total elimination of this cultural practice that is harmful for girl children and women ;  
The international community could contribute to the implementation of the sustainable development programmes required for economic and social progress in the developing countries by providing financial and technical support to those countries and facilitating access to environmentally sound alternative technologies .  
The draft resolution was essentially a procedural document dealing with institutional links between the United Nations and the Secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the necessary financial support , but listed in its preambular part the main events that had occurred during the year pursuant to the Convention , which was of crucial importance to many developing countries . 
It should be noted that the countries concerned have paid priority attention to certain important dimensions , such as the mission of national steering committees for the process , internal efforts to mobilize financial resources and the intensification of the consultative process based on efforts to achieve a convergence of views with the main bilateral and multilateral partners .  7 .  At the subregional level , all of the competent organizations are now fully engaged in the formulation of subregional action programmes .  
Ukraine invited all States and international organizations , pursuant to resolution 50 / 134 adopted by the General Assembly at its previous session , to provide technical and financial assistance to the scientific and technological research programmes being conducted under the auspices of the International Scientific and Technological Centre recently established in Chernobyl .  
The International Monitoring Committee to supervise the implementation of the Bangui Agreements , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
While it is evident that crime , particularly economic and organized crime in its transnational dimensions , is detrimental to the sustainable development of the African countries , financial cuts in this research area may have negative long-term consequences for the continent as a whole .  
Legacies to future generations are a collective responsibility of todays citizens be this the legacy of natural capital ( the environment ) , physical capital ( infrastructure , plant and equipment ) , financial capital ( savings ) , social capital ( institutions and structures ) and cultural capital ( the values , principles and concepts that are handed down ) . 
The participants noted the need for increased financial and technical assistance from a variety of sources , including export credit institutions , as well as import promotion agencies in the developed countries , for viable projects promoting the exports of developing countries , and encouraged governments and enterprises to make full use of the existing sources of assistance .  
About 30 needs assessment / diagnostic missions , on request , on programme design and project formulation on governance ; civil service reform ; human resource management and development ; information technology for public management ; local governance ; decentralization ; post-conflict rehabilitation ; budgeting and budgetary systems ; mobilization of internal and external resources ; financial management capacities ; tax reforms and tax administration ; the role of the State and private sector in development ; and the peace-development link ; ( ii ) Seminars and workshops . 
Promising directions of cooperation of development of cooperative links in the mining and metallurgical , chemical and jewellery industries and light industry , mechanical engineering , building materials production , military industrial complexes and agro-industry complexes ; the establishment of inter-State industrial and financial groups and joint enterprises ; cooperation between transport department ; harmonization of the actions of the banking systems of Armenia and the Russian Federation ; and other joint actions taken in the light of the mutual economic interests of the two countries .  
ECA has collaborated with OAU in various meetings and seminars organized in the following areas : domestic mobilization of financial resources for the development of Africa ; the role of African workers and trade unions in subregional and regional economic integration ; the mobilization of resources and public awareness for refugees in Africa ; trade policies and World Trade Organization negotiations ; future relations between the African , Caribbean and Pacific Group of States and the European Union ; and globalization , development and international labour standards .  
The responsibility for preventing involuntary displacement fell to the international community , which must also provide humanitarian and financial assistance to the affected countries , bearing in mind that such measures should be part of a comprehensive strategy to promote peace , security and economic and social development in the countries concerned .  
With regard to the efforts to restructure UNHCR , his delegation supported the measures to increase its efficiency , while stressing that any lasting solution would have to be based on national , regional and international solidarity , which entailed the mobilization of considerable financial and human resources .  
Encourages relevant United Nations funds and programmes and specialized agencies , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to support local , national and international programmes and projects for the Year and also encourages them , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , as well as international financial institutions , to ensure that the concerns and contributions of older persons are integrated into their development programmes ;  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
Given the severe and irreversible health effects of lead poisoning , particularly on children , it is important to accelerate the process of eliminating unsafe uses of lead , including the use of lead in gasoline worldwide , in light of country-specific conditions and with enhanced international support and assistance to developing countries , particularly through the timely provision of technical and financial assistance and the promotion of endogenous capacity-building .  
Consideration should be given to the gradual implementation of pricing policies that are geared towards cost recovery and the equitable and efficient allocation of water , including the promotion of water conservation , in developed countries ; such policies could also be considered in developing countries when they reach an appropriate stage in their development , so as to promote the harmonious management and development of scarce water resources and generate financial resources for investment in new water supply and treatment facilities .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the debt problem , including debt relief in the form of debt rescheduling , debt reduction , debt swaps and , as appropriate , debt cancellation , as well as grants and concessional flows that will help restore creditworthiness .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
The discussions will be videotaped and the taped footage will be utilized to produce a one-hour course on international law which will be distributed , subject to financial constraints , to schools , universities , research institutions , parliamentarians and foreign ministries to promote both knowledge and understanding of international law and international relations .  
At the public sector level , action may include the regional harmonization of taxation ; the regional harmonization of regulation , supervision and financial disclosures , preferably based on international standards ; and monetary and fiscal harmonization .  
It added that the current nascent capacity of Southern financial institutions to mobilize resources in external capital markets could be expanded through strategic alliances among financial institutions , followed eventually by joint ventures .  
In Madrid in October 1994 , the Interim Committee of IMF adopted a declaration on a partnership for sustainable global growth , 4 which the Committee updated and broadened at its autumn ( northern hemisphere ) meeting in 1996.5 This set of international guidelines for macroeconomic and financial policy was intended as a framework for policy-making by all IMF members and to guide the Funds policy discussions with members . 
The financial sector , however , continues to be viewed as deserving of special consideration because of its central role in the national economy and the far-reaching damage that financial disruption , caused for instance by imprudent lending or unanticipated changes in prices , can produce in the domestic economy .  
As a result of the increased volume of financial transactions both within and across major national and international payment and settlement systems , there has been concern about the ability of the present institutional arrangements to manage the load , in particular the settlement risk ( i.e . , the risk of the failure of one party to a transaction to complete its obligations in a timely fashion ) .  
As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on sources for the financing of development ( see A / 52 / 399 ) , there has been a shift in the composition of financial flows to developing countries from public to private sector sources , with the latter now accounting for an overwhelming share of the total ( albeit not for all individual countries ) .  This situation is unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future .  
The International Monitoring Committee , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
The relief services programme provides direct material and financial aid to those refugee families without a male adult medically fit to earn an income and without other identifiable means of financial support sufficient to cover food , shelter and other basic needs . 
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , will be undertaken so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-servicing obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their associations and networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions , is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to participate effectively in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes . 
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to the Agenda .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries and monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
The somewhat positive performance by the service sectors is based on growth in the financial sector and , to a lesser extent , in community and personal services , as the preliminary figures for the remaining service sectors show negative movement .  
Within the context of increased financial flows to developing countries and the continuing surge in foreign direct investment , equity and bonds , he noted with optimism the rapid turnaround in private sector financial flows to Mexico and Argentina after the crisis of 1995 and the modest private sector flows to Africa .  
For the developed countries , those responsibilities included a sound global financial system , open trade and investment regimes and consistent and sustained growth in the advanced economies .  
Financial barriers which resulted both from underdeveloped financial infrastructures and from huge external indebtedness prevented developing countries in general and the least developed countries in particular from participating actively in the global economy , since such barriers limited their volume of foreign trade and their access to international financial markets .  
In order for developing countries to be able to attract private capital flows , they must maintain good governance , sound macroeconomic policies and close , cooperative working relations with international financial organizations .  
Such comprehensive and balanced reform should be constructed on three pillars , that is , reform in the political area , including the Security Council , reform in the economic area , especially on development , and reform in the financial area , focusing on how truly fair and equitable methods of financing the activities of the Organization are to be realized .  
Further , implementation strategies advocated were not adopted at the country level , the nascent African private sector was not fully prepared to assume the new responsibilities in the industrial investment process and financial support , including term lending , from both domestic and foreign sources was not readily available for industrial projects .  
He welcomed the report of the Secretary-General on the operational framework for the International Year ( A / 52 / 328 ) , paragraph 43 of which stressed that the promotion of active ageing in developing countries needed technical and financial international support .  
The Secretary-General proposed to convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .  
His delegation also endorsed the proposal contained in paragraph 12 of the report that the Department of Economic and Social Affairs should convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .  
He identified the following areas where Yemen required increased technical assistance : general training in trade matters ( under TRAINFORTRADE ) , training to operate ASYCUDA , quality control in the agricultural and food industries , trade information technology , establishment of a financial market , and policy advice and experience in the area of foreign trade and trade negotiations .  
Recognizing that the problem of laundering of money derived from illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , as well as from other serious crimes , has expanded internationally to become such a global threat to the integrity , reliability and stability of financial and trade systems and even government structures as to require countermeasures by the international community as a whole in order to deny safe havens to criminals and their illicit proceeds ,  
Calls upon the United Nations International Drug Control Programme and the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Division of the Secretariat to continue to work , within the framework of their global programme against money-laundering , with relevant multilateral and regional institutions , organizations or bodies engaged in activities against money-laundering and drug trafficking and with international financial institutions to give effect to the above principles by providing training , advice and technical assistance to States upon request and where appropriate .  
Welcomes Commission on Narcotic Drugs resolution 6 ( XL ) of 25 March 1997 concerning the revised budget for the biennium 1996-1997 and the proposed outline for the biennium 1998-1999 of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , and urges all Governments to provide the fullest possible financial and political support to the organization by widening the donor base of the Programme and increasing voluntary contributions , in particular general-purpose contributions , to enable it to continue , expand and strengthen its operational and technical cooperation activities ;  
The needs of the audiovisual library may be included in the annual circular note of the Secretary-General requesting financial assistance for different components of the Programme as one of the items for which States , their institutions or private individuals may wish to make voluntary contributions in monetary terms or in kind ( tapes , equipment , etc . ) .  
The Government of the Republic of Angola has always opposed the economic blockade , and the trade and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America on the Republic of Cuba , in violation of the principles of international law and , on the several occasions when this question was discussed in international forums , particularly at the United Nations , Angola voted in favour of an unconditional lifting of such blockade , on the basis of a frank and constructive dialogue , for the benefit of the people of both countries .  
The already slow process of development in those countries would be further impeded , requiring three types of countermeasures : slowing of population growth , promotion of North-South partnership , such as that envisioned in Agenda 21 and the final documents of other major United Nations conferences , and the eradication of poverty through the creation of an international economic climate favourable to the opening up of markets , debt reduction and increased financial resources flows from North to South .  
Although hampered by financial and administrative constraints , the field operation has successfully accomplished a number of tasks , including compiling information on the human rights situation ; verifying information received , including through investigative missions ; alerting the Special Rapporteur to trends and developments so that she might take timely action ; and organizing the Special Rapporteurs missions .  
This relationship has gained a new momentum , especially in the current international situation , which has witnessed the diversion of a large proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources and has placed a heavy burden on the economies of all nations , particularly the developing countries .  
It was realistic in that it focused on concrete partnerships and practical solutions , and would tap the human , technological and financial resources which had been beyond the reach of the United Nations , and which had become far greater than official development assistance .  
In the light of the current financial situation of the United Nations , the Committee 's attention is drawn to the established practice that all activities related to international conventions or treaties that , under their respective legal instruments , are to be financed outside the regular budget of the United Nations may only be undertaken when sufficient resources to cover the activities in question have been received from the States parties in advance .  
He underscored the importance of technical and economic cooperation among developing countries and said that additional resources were needed in support of such cooperation from the United Nations system , international financial institutions and other public and private sources .  
Although the commercial private sector and non-profit civil society provided a volume of investment and development activities which dwarfed the financial flows channelled through the United Nations , the vast majority of speakers in the plenary meetings of the General Assembly as well as in the Second Committee had reinforced the central role of the United Nations in development cooperation .  
The main needs of developing countries with respect to EMS and ISO 14001 include assistance in awareness building , access to information , access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , technical and financial support for participation in the development of international standards , infrastructure requirements including through assistance in the development and implementation of related legislation , the training of local auditors and consultants , sharing experiences on implementing EMS , and support for SMEs .  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially in Africa and the least developed countries , will require the mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
It is noteworthy that the financial resources of the Centres continued to decline in the post-cold-war era despite a broad recognition that the Centres could play a meaningful role in the changed international security environment where regional approaches to disarmament have acquired increasing importance .  
Decisions by substantive legislative bodies requesting new publication ( s ) , subsequent to those approved in the programme budget , should be taken only after the careful review of , among other things , information on the potential for duplication and financial implications , and a time-frame should be incorporated .  
Calls upon the relevant international financial institutions to give favourable consideration to regional developmental plans , including projects and programmes of the Economic Cooperation Organization , in order to extend their assistance in the implementation of these programmes and , in particular , to the establishment of a comprehensive transport and communications infrastructure in the region of the Economic Cooperation Organization that would provide the landlocked countries with greater mobility to promote interregional trade and to establish mutually beneficial economic and commercial interaction with other regions ;  
Invites the relevant international financial institutions to give appropriate consideration to regional developmental plans , including projects and programmes of the Economic Cooperation Organization , in order to extend their assistance in the implementation of these programmes and , in particular , to the establishment of a comprehensive transport and communications infrastructure in the region of the Economic Cooperation Organization that would provide the landlocked countries with greater mobility to promote interregional trade and to establish mutually beneficial economic and commercial interaction with other regions ;  
Among the cross-cutting development constraints hampering the private sector were an ineffective or shallow financial sector ; lack of a legal and regulatory system ; weak infrastructure ; obsolete technology , poor on - and off-farm storage facilities , high taxation , and generally inadequate support services ; an inadequate policy framework ; an inefficient and overly dominant public enterprise sector ; misdirected development assistance ; high transaction costs ; and lack of trust in the interaction between the Government and the private sector .  
The Commission concludes that Governments and other organizations should work together with UNCTAD to create an enabling environment for micro finance institutions ( MFIs ) and that to work with MFIs in mobilizing funds from sources such as the international financial market is timely and important .  * As agreed at the Commissions third ( closing ) plenary meeting on 5 December 1997 .  
Expressing its concern that a number of developing countries , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , have become more vulnerable to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate of private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Noting that the globalization of financial markets can generate new risks of instability , including interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations , which have the potential to aggravate the volatility of short-term capital flows and to adversely affect the international financial system , requiring all countries to pursue sound economic policies and to recognize the external economic impact of their domestic policies ,  
Recognizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries and monetary and financial authorities and institutions so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Also recognizes the importance of ensuring transparency and accountability at the national level to achieve policy credibility and confidence-building as well as sound regulatory and supervisory arrangements so as to strengthen the domestic financial system , and further recognizes the importance of a stable international economic environment and stability in the international monetary system ;  
Stresses the need for strengthened international cooperation through strengthened regional and multilateral cooperation to prevent future currency crises , which negatively affect not only developing countries but also the international financial and monetary system ;  
Recognizes the benefit of exchange rate stability and a stable financial environment , and the potential impact on all countries of lack of stability in the foreign exchange markets , and in that regard invites the International Monetary Fund to fully exercise its mandate to sustain effective surveillance over the underlying macroeconomic policies of its member countries , in particular those countries whose economies are particularly relevant for the stability of the international monetary and financial system ;  
Also recognizes that an effective International Monetary Fund surveillance mechanism requires , among other elements , the regular and timely provision of reliable economic and financial data from all Fund members , and in that regard invites the Fund , within its mandate , to explore how data can be gathered from other relevant sources in order to contribute to the effectiveness of its surveillance mechanism ;  
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene in 1999 , within the overall level of resources for the biennium 1998-1999 , another meeting of governmental experts from landlocked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems , including sectoral aspects , as well as transit transportation costs , with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating necessary action-oriented measures ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , international financial organizations and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;  
Emphasizes the importance of supporting and strengthening the new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities laid down in the new sustainable development programme for the region ;  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of the region ;  
Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti has begun to implement a structural adjustment programme , and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences , in particular the social consequences , of the adjustment policy being implemented , so that the country may achieve lasting economic results ,  
Stresses that a favourable and conducive international and national economic , financial , political , social and legal environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the effective integration of women in development ;  
Calls upon all Governments and relevant United Nations organizations , including the multilateral financial institutions , to consider increasing allocations for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
The financial situation of the Agency was becoming more disturbing with every year that passed , and in that connection the European Union called on the international community to provide maximum political and financial support to the Agency and to give it sufficient resources to enable it to carry out its tasks until a just , lasting and comprehensive solution had been found to the political problems which had led to the appearance of Palestinian refugees in the Middle East . 
The system of financial assistance for returnees had set the stage for these changes as early as 1982 , but it was not until 1986 with the introduction of strict controls on foreigners ' entry and stay in France and widespread identity checks , that all immigrant groups were designated as potentially responsible for everything wrong with French society , an attitude which encouraged a particularly disturbing racist and xenophobic movement in France , especially at the electoral level . 
Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the summary records of the Fifth Committee , given the technical complexity of their subject matter , are prepared by experienced language staff who are thoroughly familiar with current administrative and financial developments in the Organization , and are issued within a reasonable time-frame ;  
A wide range of applications were planned through those services , including distance learning , corporate training , collaborative work-groups , telecommuting , telemedicine , wireless backbone interconnection ( that is , wireless Local Area Network-Wide Area Network ) , video distribution , DTH video and satellite newsgathering , as well as the distribution of software , music , scientific data and global financial and weather information .  
Treaty bodies were encouraged to appoint individual members to liaise with specialized agencies or other intergovernmental bodies of most relevance to their respective mandate and to invite representatives of international financial institutions and other international and multilateral and development institutions to present to them an analysis of the impact of their activities on women 's enjoyment of economic and social rights in the light of international standards in general , and in relation to particular States .  
In addition , information is provided on the serious problems facing the Cuban economy resulting from the severance of economic relations with the former Soviet Union and the countries of Eastern Europe , which were Cuba 's main trading partners ; the effects of the almost 40-year economic , commercial and financial blockade of Cuba ; problems affecting its principal exports , especially cane sugar ; and natural disasters , including hurricanes and tropical storms and infestation by a new agricultural pest .  
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter of the United Nations ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Noting also that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
The main body of the report shall be comprehensive , informative and analytical in a way that will allow Member States to examine and assess , inter alia , through its debate the extent to which mandates given by the General Assembly have been fulfilled , as well as for priority setting by Member States in the context of major political , economic and social , administrative and financial issues on its agenda .  
First , there is a need to evolve a genuine partnership which recognizes the inequality and disadvantaged situation of the developing countries in the global economy and thus an imperative for the developed countries to have the much-needed political will to support the development efforts of developing countries through the provision of concessional financial flows , preferential treatment in market access , durable debt-relief measures , favourable terms in the transfer of technology and support for South-South cooperation .  
It also reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development .  
To respond to those urgent humanitarian needs , the Government , lacking other resources , had to redeploy , on an emergency basis , a major part of the State budget and financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes .  
In addition to that proposal , various other topics were mentioned with respect to which it might be worthwhile to explore the desirability and feasibility of work at the international level ; those were : legislative treatment of cross-border insolvency in the banking and financial services sector , preparation of model agreements or practices for cross-border cooperation in reorganizations of insolvent enterprises , conflict-of-laws solutions in cross-border insolvency cases , and the effects of insolvency proceedings on arbitration agreements and arbitral proceedings .  
Many countries ( which have suffered and continue to suffer great material and financial damage as a result of sanctions ) are therefore completely justified in their desire to elaborate basic criteria and conditions for the application and implementation of mandatory sanctions , and develop ways and means of preventing the adverse consequences of such sanctions or , at least , reducing them to a minimum .  
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
One critical constraint had been the lack of adequate financial resources , both from national budgets and from traditional sources of development assistance to support TCDC activities and another was the ineffective functioning of TCDC national focal points .  
The constant state of financial difficulties , a very lengthy period of transition and the crippling effect of serious time constraints on all participants in the legislative process has led to a situation where budgetary approval comes about not as the result of an orderly process but rather as an achievement arrived at in an ad hoc manner often in the absence of sufficient data , analysis and justification .  
Among the issues that remain to be solved are the privatization of parts of the public rental housing stock , meeting the cost of renovation of private homes in mixed-ownership buildings , the future role of private rental housing , strengthening of market-type financial institutions in the housing sector and the introduction of legal and financial elements of real estate renting .  
On the contrary , they have become even more marginalized in the global economy for the very simple reason that they lack the physical , financial and human resources as well as the institutional infrastructure necessary for effective competition and integration in the international markets .  
In the current post-transition phase , the results achieved in the democratic processes and economic reform , which have been recognized by the international community and financial institutions , qualify Romania legitimately to play a clearer and more active role in defining and designing common projects of security and progress in the region and in the world , including within the United Nations and its specialized agencies .  
Our debates will have to take into account the recent trends in world economy such as high rates of growth , far exceeding those of gross world product achieved by world trade ; transportation ; and the volume of direct investment and international financial transactions and the necessity of ensuring a wider access of goods produced in developing countries to the developed countries ' markets and enhanced cooperation on third markets .  
There can be no universal environmental preservation without a genuine change in the unsustainable consumption patterns that bring about the increasing deterioration of the global environment , without adequate financial assistance for development in percentages proportional to gross domestic product , and without adequate facilities to access modern technologies .  
Over the last six months , we have used this peace-building fund for the following purposes : to provide critical start-up funding for the historical clarification Commission in Guatemala ; to assist the preparatory commission for the establishment of an international criminal court by underwriting the participation of delegates from developing countries ; and to provide financial assistance for the work of the joint United Nations / Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) Special Representative for the Great Lakes region of Africa , Mr . Mohamed Sahnoun .  
It highlights the continuation of the basically adverse nature of an international economic environment characterized by the North 's increasing monopoly of the decisive elements of development : trade , financial and stock markets , flows of capital and investment , and technology transfer .  
Like other members , I noted with particular interest that President Clinton first at the Waldorf Astoria hotel on the evening of 21 September , then the following day in this Hall forcefully and germanely stressed the need for the United Nations to ensure that the globalization of the economy does not create deep disparities between rich and poor and that it establishes innovative partnerships between the private sector , non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
While , to be sure , it is first and foremost up to the African countries to make the greater part of the effort , the excessively restrictive procedures and conditionalities for the granting of loans , and the lukewarm reaction of certain creditors to the idea of simply cancelling the foreign debt of poor countries , are obstacles to the effective mobilization of the expected financial resources .  
Today the developed countries have the moral duty to be as concerned as Africans themselves about the destiny of Africa , not to abandon Africa along the roadside of globalization and to make available to it part of their enormous material , technological and financial strength , in order to support Africa 's efforts in the struggle to emerge from underdevelopment and to enter the modern age .  
In this regard , our objectives are to correct the economic , financial and structural imbalances ; to achieve steadiness and stability in the economy as a whole ; to activate the role of the private sector in the competitive free-market economy ; to achieve sustainable development ; to foster stable environments so as to attract foreign investments ; to upgrade the basic necessary services of society ; and to build the new State and improve the standards of living of all citizens .  
This leads me to say that a country such as Yemen , which mainly depends on foreign aid to carry out its internal policy that is , its economic , social and cultural development has to take into account , in seeking the financial and technical assistance needed to achieve the objectives of the internal policy , certain basic considerations that might seem to others supplementary and not mandatory .  
We are convinced that at a time when the question of more rational use of United Nations resources , including financial resources , has become a priority , the Secretary-General 's decision to focus on the activities that the United Nations can best carry out , from the standpoint both of using existing intellectual potential and of meeting the requirements of a large group of members of the international community , is very wise .  
Within the context of an increasingly integrated and complex global economic system of production and distribution , trade liberalization and globalization of financial markets , the major thrust of the development strategy of the Government of the Republic of Suriname lies in the revitalization and strengthening of production and export capacity as the main engines of growth while maintaining financial and monetary stability .  
For meaningful development to take root in the developing countries , an enabling international environment should be established which can address such issues as macroeconomic stability , more open trade regimes in developed countries , stable financial systems , reasonable debt initiatives , such as those proposed under the World Bank 's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and greater financial flows from developed countries to the developing countries .  
And we seek the active partnership of the multilateral institutions as well as of the international community , through joint ventures , technological transfers and financial and technical assistance to provide the impetus to sustained economic growth .  
Information provided both by the Secretariat and by specialized agencies gives an objective quantitative picture of where the phenomena of poverty , unemployment and social disintegration are most acute : the same places experiencing an increased deterioration in the terms of trade ; protectionism ; a fall in the prices of exported raw materials ; and the drying up of financial flows .  
In this spirit , the United Nations must look for the best ways and means to make its activities in the area of social development more effective , including by strengthening coordination between economic and social activities and improving coordination with international financial institutions , since only through concrete and pragmatic programmes can our Organization get more out of the aid and assistance it provides to States for the establishment of social policies .  
Algeria is keen to preserve what it has achieved , in spite of economic difficulties due to financial constraints and the requirements of economic and institutional restructuring , which are designed firmly to put Algerian society on the path to progress and modernity through the creation of a more efficient market economy and the establishment of a pluralistic democratic society .  
The international economic system must be overhauled to enhance the trade prospects of the poor countries and to facilitate their access to science and technology , technical assistance and increased financial flows , both private and official .  
All national development efforts need a vision a focal point to make coordinated and sustained improvements supported by political will , the participation of the people and solid organizational and financial backing .  
Without a supportive external economic environment that includes cooperation in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies , trade liberalization , mobilization of new and additional financial resources , financial stability , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , and productive investment in technologies , our efforts would be akin to trying to roll uphill .  
An essential element in propagating a culture of peace is to refrain from implementing policies that would widen the gulf between the rich developed countries and poor third world countries , unable to ensure growth , to make the best use of their natural and human resources , with the resultant unemployment , financial deficit and indebtedness worsening year after year .  
For the East Asian region , which has been subjected to extreme volatility of currency and stock markets , the urgent need for critical regulatory safeguards in respect of international financial markets is unambiguous .  
The resolution calls for a report that is more easily directed to assessing the way in which mandates of the General Assembly have been fulfilled over the past year and setting priorities for the period ahead in the major political , economic and social , administrative and financial areas .  
The increasing necessity and demand for activities in the field of peacekeeping and related areas , and the simultaneous political and financial problems connected with these United Nations activities , have made it clear at an early stage that the involvement of regional organizations in this area has to be enhanced , for their mutual benefit .  
Similarly , it is recognized that implementation of the Summit 's Declaration and Programme of Action will require the mobilization of financial resources at the national and international levels and that the specific cases of Africa and the least developed countries will need additional resources and more effective development cooperation and assistance .  
However , we believe it is fitting to express our thanks for the support and cooperation of the United Nations , the friendly countries that directly supported the peace processes in Guatemala , Nicaragua and El Salvador , and the cooperating community , whose technical and financial assistance complemented the political and diplomatic efforts to achieve peace in the region .  
It is precisely because of our recognition of the specific and peculiar problems faced by the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories most of which are small island Territories that suffer from impediments created by the interplay of such factors as economic and geographic size , isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters and lack of technological and financial resources , including problems of accessibility to international credit markets that the international community should give specific priority and attention to the process of decolonization affecting the peoples of those Territories . 
Thailand also strongly feels that it is only just and logical that those who manufacture , export and earn profits from landmines should have special responsibility in bearing at least a major portion of the costs of financial and technical aid to mine-affected countries , rehabilitation programmes for the stricken societies and communities and humanitarian assistance to the victims and to mine survivors themselves and their families .  
On the one hand and thanks to the praiseworthy support of the Organization of African Unity , the League of Arab States , the French Republic and the assistance of the international community its goal was to lay the foundations for the reconstruction of a country that has for so long been buffeted by numerous acts of external aggression that have engendered enormous economic and financial difficulties that have significantly hampered its development . 
If any attempt were made to make a list of such elements , however , it would have to include many others that affect international peace and security and relations of respect and cooperation between States , such as the implementation of unilateral measures of political , economic and financial coercion and the arbitrary and indefinite imposition of Security Council sanctions that do not take humanitarian limitations into account .  
Since our Secretary-General presented his proposals for reform in July , the Central American countries have expressed firm support for his ideas about a modern , efficient , nimble Organization with better coordination in line with current administrative and financial trends , an Organization enabling us , without further delay , to move from lofty aspirations to real actions that will help everybody , especially those in developing countries , which comprise the overwhelming majority of the members of this body .  
That process was expected to result in the preparation of a comprehensive and balanced document to address both security and humanitarian aspects of the problem , and to make provisions for financial support and the transfer of relevant advanced technology to affected countries , enabling those States to overcome this serious problem .  
We believe that measures aimed at curbing mines should be accompanied by serious and concrete steps geared towards mine clearance in affected countries that are unable to achieve that objective on their own , by providing technical and financial support and through the transfer of necessary advanced technology to enable these States to overcome this tragic legacy . 
In the view of Argentina , before deciding to convene the special session , and after having carefully studied its financial implications , it would be advisable to ensure the proper preparation of the session and provide it with some real content so that we do not repeat past mistakes .  
The mutual recognition of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1993 , the signing of the Declaration of Principles and the subsequent withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and some areas of the West Bank , as well as the establishment of an elected Palestinian Authority , were historic milestones along the road to peace that the international community encouraged and nurtured with political and financial support .  
This session is confronted with the onerous task not only of pointing to the imbalances that have emerged since Rio between the advances in political and economic reforms achieved in the third world and the clearly diminishing resources to fund sustainable development , but also of securing a renewed commitment , with firm assurances , to stronger financial aid .  
Although the world community set out on the right path with the adoption of Agenda 21 in Rio , and although steps are being taken on the national and international levels towards achieving our goals , globalization , economic and social disparities , pressing agricultural and industrial needs , serious financial constraints and technological deficiencies all combine to make sustainable development an elusive target .  
Most developing countries , however , and particularly the least developed countries have not been able to expand their trade , to become integrated into world financial markets , or to attract much foreign investment , due primarily to lack of human resource development , infrastructure , political and economic stability , or networking .  
For most developing countries , continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet the needs for investment capital , foreign exchange , and human development priorities .  
In addition to national systems of financial regulation , international standards are also needed to promote sound financial principles and practices and avoid destructive competition and inconsistency between countries .  Such international standards should be developed through the existing international bodies that coordinate financial regulation and supervision .  
The trend to policy convergence towards the open-economy model derives in part from the demonstrated or perceived successes of that model ; it is also driven by global market actors , in particular developed country Governments and international financial and trade institutions that make such policies a condition for access to resources . 
In the face of the tendency of global financial markets and international financial institutions to demand fiscal and monetary austerity , especially of the weaker economies , constraining both national and international economic growth , there is a need to develop new national and international policy instruments to promote growth and employment while maintaining macroeconomic stability . 
Volatile financial flows not only pose threats to the solvency of national financial institutions , whether public or private but also have the potential to destabilize the international financial system , given the increasingly integrated nature of world capital markets .  
Reduction of poverty requires not just providing goods and services to people living in poverty but also improving opportunities for access to productive resources and capital accumulation , including human capital ( education , health ) , financial capital ( microcredit ) , physical capital ( appropriate technology ) and natural resources ( land , water , energy ) .  
Continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet those needs , to support structural adjustment , and to enable the least developed countries and other low-income countries to benefit from globalization and to generate sustained growth .  
Developed countries should continue to reorient their ODA in favour of the least developed countries , whose trade and investment opportunities are otherwise limited , and in favour of those new social-sector targets agreed upon by the OECD Development Assistance Committee ( DAC ) at its ministerial meeting in May 1996.1 Furthermore , given the rapid emergence of advanced developing countries in Asia and Latin America as new donors , South / South cooperation could be encouraged with financial assistance from developed countries . 
While national systems of regulation and control are essential prerequisites for financial stability and sustained capital flows , international standards are needed to promote sound principles and practices and to avoid competition and inconsistency between countries .  
The attention of the Commission is also drawn to Economic and Social Council decision 1996 / 295 of 24 July 1996 , by which the Council , taking note of Commission on Human Rights decision 1996 / 111 of 23 April 1996 , decided to authorize , if possible within existing financial resources , 40 fully serviced additional meetings , including summary records , in accordance with rules 29 and 31 of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , for the Commission 's fifty _ third session .  
In accordance with the resolution and arrangements : voluntary contributions paid to the Fund are distributed , through established channels of assistance , as humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals who have been tortured and to their relatives ; the Fund is administered by the Secretary-General with the advice of a board of trustees authorized to promote and solicit contributions and pledges ; and an annual report is submitted by the Secretary-General to the Assembly and , as appropriate , to the Commission on Human Rights .  
Recognizing further that the international community at large and , in particular , international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter , in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States ,  
Reaffirms the importance of ensuring the uniform and consistent application of the Convention and a coordinated approach to its overall implementation , and of strengthening technical cooperation and financial assistance for this purpose , stresses once again the continuing importance of the efforts of the Secretary-General to these ends , and reiterates its invitation to the competent international organizations and other international bodies to support these objectives ;  
Clearing arrears and establishing a sustainable debt-servicing position create an opportunity which , combined with structural adjustment and official financial support , can promote foreign and private investment and , thus , economic growth .  
Two points should be made clear : ( a ) at a time when the Human Rights Operation in Rwanda was advising staff not to travel on Cameroon Airlines aircraft and to be careful in their choice of airlines , the Special Rapporteur was forced to travel by Cameroon Airlines ; this is particularly regrettable in that experts and special rapporteurs have no insurance coverage ; ( b ) the Special Rapporteur 's budget of $ 69,770 for the current financial year had not yet been touched , although the year was drawing to a close . 
The Conference of the Parties decided that the restructured GEF should continue , on an interim basis , to serve as the institutional structure on an interim basis , and in its decisions II / 6 and II / 7 instructed GEF to facilitate urgent implementation of articles 6 and 8 of the Convention by making available to developing country Parties financial resources for projects in a flexible and expeditious manner .  
Countries are still a long way from attaining the objective of providing incentive measures to enhance local benefits from biodiversity , including establishing secure property or use rights ; providing education and relevant technologies ; providing compensation for damage to crops , livestock and other property damaged by wild animals / predators ; involving local communities in biodiversity management ; and providing endowment funds or other financial mechanisms that ensure predictable and secure sources of income , such as user fees , franchises , land-use taxes and bonds .  
Cooperation and corporate responsibility of the private sector in acknowledging and addressing public concerns over unintended consequences of technological applications , including biotechnology , are essential for the success of economic and financial policies of Governments , including the implementation of transparent EIAs on proposed projects .  * The report was prepared by the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , as task manger for chapter 15 of Agenda 21 , in accordance with arrangements agreed to by the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development ( IACSD ) .  
Constraints include : ( a ) scarcity of human and financial resources ; ( b ) low institutional capacity ; ( c ) lack of coherent realistic policies in some countries , and on occasions lack of political will ; and ( d ) inadequate awareness and understanding of the potential benefits and risks of the technology , as well as of the requirements for its environmentally sound management .  
As noted above , while there has been a rapid development of land-related information systems in those economies having access to adequate financial and technological resources , information systems in many developing countries have been severely limited by the non-availability of basic natural resource data and information , by undeveloped market infrastructure , and by a lack of institutional capability .  
The need for improved access to funding is recognized by the innovative proposal to establish a global mechanism to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms and to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial financial resources to affected developing country Parties to the Convention .  
Since rural energy problems persist and energy is not playing its full role as a motor for rural development , the following issues have emerged as complementary priorities or as new areas of focus : ( a ) more emphasis on the micro or household level ; ( b ) renewed interest in eco-village projects , solar villages etc . ; ( c ) promotion of innovative financial schemes to promote small businesses ; and ( d ) emphasis on the impact of rural energy on agricultural productivity .  
At the international level , some promising progress has been achieved by joint implementation programmes , international environmental funds and national environmental funds , which have started attracting external financial resources .  
The main objectives of chapter 33 of Agenda 21 are ( a ) to establish measures concerning financial resources and mechanisms for the implementation of Agenda 21 ; ( b ) to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable ; and ( c ) to seek the full use and continuing qualitative improvement of funding mechanisms to be utilized for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
Given the current scarcity of public resources , additional funds need to be mobilized through increased use of economic instruments ( general tax reforms , eco-taxes , subsidy reduction and tradeable permit schemes ) , increased private-sector involvement , national environmental funds and innovative international financial mechanisms .  
There are some successful models for international financial mechanisms , such as joint implementation programmes ( e.g . , the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly ( AIJ ) established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its first meeting and international environmental funds ( e.g . , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and the Montreal Protocol Environmental Fund ( MPEF ) ) which have transferred developed country resources to developing countries for investments in sustainable development related to the protection of the global environment . 
Egypt is aware of the magnitude and severity of the problems related to the proliferation of anti _ personnel landmines , which is above all a humanitarian issue given the suffering they inflict on civilian populations , the heavy financial burden and the limited nature of the technology used in the detection and deactivation of these mines . 
While legal and institutional instruments have definitely improved the basis for sustainable development of oceans and coastal areas , implementation lags behind owing , among other things , to ( a ) the difficulty in making political decisions regarding resources and wealth allocation ; ( b ) the difficulty of improving inadequate or inefficient institutions ; and ( c ) in many cases , difficulties in meeting the related financial commitments .  
Urges Member States carefully to consider the problems posed by the international aspects of corrupt practices , especially as regards international economic activities carried out by corporate entities , and to study appropriate legislative and regulatory measures to ensure the transparency and integrity of financial systems and transactions carried out by such corporate entities ;  
Decides that the preparatory process for the special session of the General Assembly should be funded through the regular budget of the United Nations , bearing in mind the need to keep financial costs to a minimum , and that Governments should be invited to make extrabudgetary contributions to meet those costs ;  
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
Noting the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts , notably in Somalia , which have disrupted services , transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues ,  
Considering , in particular , that in order to respond to those urgent humanitarian needs the Government of the Comoros , in the absence of other resources , had to reallocate as a matter of great urgency the major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State and the financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes ,  
Acknowledges the interest in holding the next informal round table in the Latin American and Caribbean region , to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa , and invites interested States to cooperate with the relevant agencies , organizations , funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the convening of these informal round tables on communication for development , with the participation of the international financial institutions and the regional banks , at the country level ;  
By its decision 51 / 406 of 17 October 1996 , the General Assembly decided that , for Member States that had fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of $ 1,970,718 gross ( $ 1,718,168 net ) for the period from 16 May 1995 to 12 January 1996 should be set off against future assessments .  
Fund-raising and promotional efforts directed towards increasing funding opportunities resulted in several project-specific donations and , thanks to the continuous support of Italy , the host country , the overall financial situation of UNICRI stabilized at a somewhat more viable level , although demands for assistance and services are still greater than the capacity of UNICRI to provide timely and adequate responses to them . 
Reiterates that any administering Power that deprives the colonial peoples of Non-Self-Governing Territories of the exercise of their legitimate rights over their natural resources , or subordinates the rights and interests of those peoples to foreign economic and financial interests , violates the solemn obligations it has assumed under the Charter ;  
Reaffirms its concern about the activities of those foreign economic , financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories in the Caribbean , the Pacific and other regions , as well as their human resources , to the detriment of their interests , thus depriving them of their right to control the resources of their Territories and impeding the realization by those peoples of their legitimate aspirations for self-determination and independence ;  
Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt , timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies , both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation , reconstruction and long-term development , which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time ,  
Calls upon Governments to invite and encourage the active support and participation of a broad and diverse range of other institutional actors , including legislative bodies , academic and research institutions , professional associations , trade unions , local community groups and the media , as well as financial and non-profit organizations for the implementation of the Platform for Action ;  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Emphasizing the importance of cooperation and international solidarity in supporting the efforts being made by the peoples and Governments of Central America for the consolidation of a firm and lasting peace , and the need to strengthen the new programme of cooperation and economic , technical and financial assistance for Central America in the light of the new situation in the region ,  
Supports the treatment accorded to Nicaragua in the light of its continuing exceptional circumstances , so that the international community and financial institutions can incorporate that treatment into programmes to support the country 's economic recovery and social reconstruction ;  
The emphasis by the CSD " that for all developing countries to benefit more fully from trade liberalization , the achievement of other objectives identified in Agenda 21 , particularly better functioning of commodity markets , increasing foreign direct investment ( FDI ) in developing countries and financial assistance , including debt relief , are important " 6 continues to be relevant to policy efforts .  
Policy-makers have therefore increasingly focused on positive measures largely based on market mechanisms and financial incentives to capture the numerous external benefits provided by biologically diverse ecosystems . 63 These mechanisms include debt-for-nature swaps , transferable development rights , green taxes on eco-tourist activities , watershed protection payments , and managed harvest rights in protected areas . 
Mexico noted that there was a lack of clarity in the idea put forward in the Working Group that " in exceptional cases , when the Committee deemed that there was no other reasonable way to lodge a communication , some other means could be accepted , such as oral presentation , or taped submissions " . 6 On that point , the view was taken that consideration should be given to the practical difficulties that an oral presentation would give rise to , including significant financial implications . 
Close to 40 formal case-studies were commissioned and three very successful international workshops were held , with financial support mobilized from a wide variety of sources : a regional workshop for Africa ( Dakar , June 1995 ) ; an international workshop for Asia and other regions ( Madras , February 1996 ) ; and a global meeting during the Habitat II .  
The objective will be to develop an integrated and multidimensional strategy for the implementation , coordination and promotion of the right to development in accordance with the Declaration on the Right to Development and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , aimed at facilitating action to be taken by relevant bodies of the United Nations system , including human rights treaty bodies , and international development and financial institutions and non _ governmental organizations . 
Expressing concern that a number of developing countries have become more vulnerable , in the course of liberalizing their external economic and financial regimes , to the volatile fluctuations of private capital flows in international financial markets , and stressing the importance at the national level in the countries concerned of a favourable climate for private financial flows , sound macroeconomic policies and appropriate functioning of markets ,  
Recognizes that technological advances have reduced the costs and increased the speed of international financial transactions and that , as policy liberalization has facilitated international capital flows , financial institutions have increasingly added foreign assets to their portfolios , paving the way towards the phenomenon of global financial integration ;  
Also stresses that implementation of sound domestic monetary , fiscal and structural policies over the medium term , including ensuring sound banking systems , is required to promote financial and exchange rate stability ;  
Emphasizes the need to explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly of developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact upon the international financial system ;  
Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned , in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme , the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific , the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources , to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours ;  
The Government of Iraq resorted to the imposition of a tax on travel as a purely administrative and financial measure that was not intended to impede travel by citizens or discriminate between them on political or social grounds ; it was necessitated by the situation brought about by the iniquitous economic embargo imposed on Iraq .  
The assessment team meets with interested parties , both governmental and non-governmental , in close cooperation with the United Nations Resident Coordinator , United Nations agencies and programmes , as well as local donors , and compiles detailed information on current policies , legislation , and human and financial capacities in key areas .  
All the while , a core of supporting multilateral agencies , despite severe financial constraints , have provided some of the required support and sought together , in a pragmatic manner , to identify their comparative advantages in responding to the countries ' perceived needs and in identifying the respective areas of complementarity .  
UNDP has played a key role in the development of a common understanding of the programme approach which is now contained in the Operational Activities Reference Manual published in 1996 by the Consultative Committee on Programme and Operational Questions ( CCPOQ ) with significant substantive and financial support from UNDP . 
As indicated in the report on follow-up to the decisions taken by the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 1996 , CCPOQ , with considerable substantive and financial assistance from UNDP , published an operational activities reference manual , which has now been forwarded to all country offices and will serve as a unifying framework within which each agency will operate using its own detailed operational procedures .  
Thus , it should support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development .  
Encourages relevant United Nations funds and programmes and the specialized agencies , non-governmental organizations and the private sector to support local , national , and international programmes and projects for the Year , and also encourages them , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , as well as the international financial institutions , to ensure that the concerns and contributions of older persons are integrated into their development programmes ;  
There is need for a coherent set of legislative measures with programmes to achieve strengthening of the small business [ and informal ] sector through the development of appropriate legal , management and financial structures , to enable the sector to develop in a sustained and organized way ; and to initiate and strengthen financing mechanism that enhance small business [ and informal ] sector access to financial services and to reduce the cost of providing and acquiring these services .  
The Committee will consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , informational and financial matters .  
The Vienna Programme of Action [ 5 ] adopted by the Conference addressed three major areas : ( i ) strengthening the science and technology capacities of the developing countries ; ( ii ) restructuring the existing pattern of international scientific and technological relations in the transfer of technology ; and ( iii ) strengthening the role of the United Nations system in promoting new ways of technology cooperation as well as considerably increasing the provision of financial resources for such purposes .  
Constraints to external communication and public affairs identified through the change management exercise were : ( a ) unclear policy messages in written and oral communications , which are frequently jargon-ridden and lacking in hard facts ; ( b ) uneven collaboration between DPA and line units ; ( c ) a media-shy culture in UNDP as a whole ; and ( d ) insufficient financial investment in communication .  
While gratis personnel had played a valuable role in advancing the implementation of approved activities , particularly in the current climate of budgetary constraint , his delegation concurred with the Advisory Committee 's view that gratis personnel should not be sought solely for financial reasons but should be recruited to enhance the efficiency of the United Nations by bringing experts with needed skills and experience into the organizational fold .  
Pointing to the danger that the High-level Working Group could take decisions which were actually contrary to those adopted by the General Assembly , she proposed that all administrative and budgetary questions currently addressed by the High-level Working Group , including the review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations and human resources management , should be considered by the Fifth Committee during the resumed fifty-first session .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the highly indebted poorest countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , comprehensive , durable and development-oriented solutions , including such measures as debt reduction , debt swaps , debt cancellation , and increased grants and concessional flows . 
Policies for promoting domestic resources mobilization should include macroeconomic and structural reforms , public expenditure reforms , the promotion of environmental taxes and charges , a review of existing subsidy policies , and financial sector development to promote personal saving and access to credit , taking into account the characteristics and capabilities of individual countries .  
Secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity and human resources , and adequate access to technology may promote the implementation of international legal instruments .  
It is important for Governments , financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , civil society , women 's organizations and other relevant actors to promote women 's entrepreneurial and self-employed activities through technical assistance services or programmes ; information on markets ; training ; the creation of networks , including those at the regional and international levels ; and adequate financial support ; and where appropriate , by developing incentives .  
Everyone has the right [ is entitled ] , individually and in association with others , to solicit , receive and utilize voluntary financial or other contributions , for the purpose of promoting and protecting , through peaceful means , [ universally recognized ] human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to issue specific administrative instructions to establish clearly the responsibility and accountability of programme managers for proper use of human resources , as well as sanctions in accordance with staff rule 112.3 for any financial loss suffered by the United Nations as a result of gross negligence , including improper motivation , wilful violation or reckless disregard of the Staff Regulations and Rules and established policies regulating recruitment , placement and promotion ;  
In contrast , the principle was recognized long ago in the environmental area in which many of the arrangements made in relation to key treaties provide for financial and other forms of assistance to help States to undertake the necessary monitoring , to prepare reports and to implement some of the measures required in order to ensure compliance with treaty obligations .  26 .  Thus the principal question in the present context is what measures might be taken in order to facilitate achievement of the oft-confirmed goal of universal ratification of the six core treaties ?  
It has been suggested in a number of places in this report that the provision of advisory services , or technical cooperation in the field of human rights , has a vital role to play in relation to those States which do not have the administrative capacity , technical expertise or financial resources required to prepare the reports they are legally obligated to provide under the relevant treaties .  
Also requests the Secretary-General to issue specific administrative instructions to establish clearly the responsibility and accountability of programme managers for proper use of human resources , as well as sanctions in accordance with staff rule 112.3 for any financial loss suffered by the United Nations as a result of gross negligence , including improper motivation , wilful violation or reckless disregard of the Staff Regulations and Rules and established policies regulating recruitment , placement and promotion ;  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
The international community will in future have to supply technological , economic and financial assistance to support political stability and balanced development , democratic institution-building and respect for human rights .  
Stressing the link between peace and development , noting that significant international assistance is indispensable for sustainable development in Haiti , and stressing that a sustained commitment by the international community and the international financial institutions to assist and support the economic , social and institutional development in Haiti is indispensable for long-term peace and security in the country ,  
Invites States , intergovernmental organizations and all those participating in the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction to provide technical and financial assistance , including national capacity-building , to developing countries to support global and regional observation systems and research , including the dissemination of data on El Ni �� , to prevent , mitigate and redress the negative effects of the phenomenon ;  
Invites donor countries , the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction , maintenance and improvement of their transport , storage and other transit-related facilities , including alternative routes and improved communications , and to promote subregional , regional and interregional projects and programmes ;  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene in 1999 within the overall level of resources for the biennium 1998-1999 , another meeting of governmental experts from landlocked and transit developing countries , and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems , including sectoral aspects , as well as transit transportation costs , with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating necessary action-oriented measures ;  
Calls upon both the bilateral and multilateral donor communities to mobilize adequate financial resources to supplement efforts by small island developing States , at both the national and regional levels , in the implementation of the programmes referred to in operative paragraph 5 above , including support to existing regional and subregional institutions ;  
However , the functioning of local government remains incomplete in important financial and legal areas : most municipalities can not provide basic communal services because they have not received sufficient funds ; only half of them have finalized plans for economic reconstruction ; and the boundaries of the new municipalities drawn before the April elections have not been legally recognized , creating doubts as to their existence after the end of UNTAES .  
The pace of future movements is inhibited by three main factors : legal and financial obstacles to the recovery of property ; unrealistic government deadlines for Serb applications for reconstruction assistance and delays in government funding for reconstruction of Serb houses ; and the uncertain economic and social situation in areas of potential return .  
Stresses that the full and effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , in particular in all developing countries , especially those in Africa and the least developed countries , will require mobilization of additional financial resources from various sources at the national and international levels and more effective development cooperation in support of national efforts in order to promote assistance for shelter and human settlements activities ;  
Emphasizes that , in developing countries , rural development remains central to poverty eradication efforts , and this often includes agrarian reform , investment in infrastructure , extension of rural financial intermediation ensuring food security , better education and greater utilization of appropriate technology , ensuring fair prices to provide incentives for agricultural investment , and increasing productivity , including productivity in the informal sector ;  
Invites the international community , including multilateral financial institutions , to implement fully and effectively all initiatives taken regarding debt relief for developing countries , including Naples terms and the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ' Debt Initiative , and to continue their efforts in this field with a view to contributing to a durable solution to the debt problems of developing countries , and encourages donors to ensure adequate financing of these mechanisms and / or initiatives , particularly in African countries and the least developed countries , and thus support their efforts to eradicate poverty ;  
In the interests of equity , binding commitments for non-Annex I Parties could not even be envisaged until agreement had been reached on a fair system of apportionment of emission limits , a globally agreed reduction pathway and a projected sustainable future emission level on an equitable basis , and until there was reliable and predictable financial provision for the acquisition and adaptation of sound technologies , know-how and production systems in developing countries .  
Such a strategy should be based on three principles : developed countries should take the lead now in committing themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 level ; developing countries should also take actions to address climate change problems in promoting their sustainable development , taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities under the Convention and their respective capabilities ; and developed countries should strengthen their partnership with developing countries through the provision of financial and technological support for mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions .  
Recognizing also that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community , the implementation of priority political , economic , social and environmental programmes and projects in the process of consolidating peace continues to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability of financial resources , delays in the disbursement of internal and external funds , lack of continuity , deficiencies in the implementation of other initiatives having an impact on the implementation of a number of projects and by the special characteristics of a complex process ,  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , the international financial organizations , and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic and international initiatives for the implementation of the programme for the Second Decade , including a favourable climate for foreign direct investment , private sector development , small and medium-sized enterprises and enhanced market access , and recognizing the need for African countries to use both human and financial resources more effectively in the process of industrialization ,  
Noting further that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have assistance funds sufficient to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
In the event , a persistent failure to implement a coherent programme of structural reform finally came to a head in Bulgaria in the spring of 1996 with a massive financial and economic crisis which has still to be resolved ; instead of growing by a forecast 3 per cent , Bulgarian GDP actually fell by 10 per cent . 
A recent study1 has stressed that a current account deficit of more than 5 per cent is likely to become a problem only when a range of conditions apply : when the export sector is small , debt service is large , domestic savings are low , and the financial sector is weak and dominated by banks subject to weak regulation .  
It also needs to be emphasized that , unlike the western European countries in the late 1940s and 1950s which benefited from Marshall aid and other official support for financing their current account deficits over a number of years and thus sustaining growth and reconstruction , the transition economies are largely dependent on private financial flows which are much more nervous and fickle than official commitments .  
The underdevelopment of the financial sector is a particularly important example of this general problem : in the absence of an effective institutional and regulatory framework for banking and other financial activities , credit risks will not be undertaken on the basis of a commercial evaluation of risks and returns , and this lack of financial discipline leads to the financial sector being an obstacle rather than a support to sustained economic growth and the creation of a modern capitalist economy .  
It is against this background that developing and transitional economy countries must grapple with the problem of maximizing the mobilization of financial resources from both domestic and foreign sources while at the same time ensuring that those resources are used in the most efficient and productive way so as to benefit all classes of the population , including the poor , and that public financial operations are reliably accounted for so as to inspire confidence among both citizens and foreign donors and investors .  
Efforts to increase the aggregate volume of personal savings deposited with financial institutions have involved the use of various incentives adapted to the social and economic conditions in the countries concerned .  
However , in Central and Eastern Europe ( including the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ) the difficulties inherent in introducing viable market and State mechanisms ab initio to replace the defunct system of control and command took a severe toll , with sharp declines in industrial output , shortfalls in agricultural production , disruption of trade flows , external financial strains and fiscal imbalances .  
A number of delegations expressed their concerns in regard to the serious financial situation of the Centre , with many noting that the financial resources available to the Centre were inadequate and that the Centre required enhanced financial as well as human resources if it were to meet its challenges at the global , regional , national and local levels .  
The arrangements agreed stress cooperation and coordination , and are rooted in recognition by all those involved of the need to achieve and maintain a streamlined process , avoiding duplication of effort and promoting efficiency and cost-effective use of human and financial resources while ensuring provision of the necessary information to the various fora charged with monitoring the actions of governments , their partners in civil society and those of international institutions , working in a coordinated manner to achieve the Summit objectives .  
In this connection , some Governments have argued that the acceptance of gratis personnel performing mandated activities would not , therefore , involve additional financial liability for the Organization since support costs have already been included in the budgets ; this argument is valid only if the gratis personnel are to be considered a substitute for staff to be recruited against authorized posts for the implementation of the approved activities .  
One critical constraint had been the lack of adequate financial resources , both from national budgets and from traditional sources of development assistance to support TCDC activities and another was the ineffective functioning of TCDC national focal points .  
The main constraints to the promotion of TCDC , as reported by many delegations and agencies , included structural and cultural differences ; lack of financial resources ; insufficient awareness of the benefits and potentials of TCDC ; limited access to information ; inadequate human resources ; and lack of coordination among the various government agencies involved in technical cooperation .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti until payment is effected .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force until payment is effected .  
While every effort was made to anticipate potential problems in the process leading up to the conclusion of the Memorandum of Understanding on the basis of which the programme is being executed , the complicated nature of the programme , including its managerial , administrative and financial aspects , has led to a number of difficulties and delays in the initial stages of its implementation .  
Missions , at the request of Governments , to provide assistance in the fields of governance and public administration policy development , administrative restructuring , civil service reform , electoral assistance , government capacity for improved performance in the public sector , government capacity for developing infrastructure and protecting the environment , post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction of government machinery , government capacity for social development , financial management , government accounting and reporting and public-private interaction ; ( ii ) Group training .  
In 1995 , the gross domestic product stood at US $ 96 million , while per capita it increased to $ 6,415 .  4 .  The performance of the Turks and Caicos economy in 1995 was characterized by continued rapid growth in tourism , a steady rise in offshore financial services business and an increase in fishing activities , combined with lower inflation rates and a slight reduction in the unemployment rate .  
General information on the Territorys offshore financial services industry is contained in the previous working paper prepared by the Secretariat ( A / AC . 109 / 2051 , paras . 12 and 13 ) .  15 .  Among the attractions for offshore companies are the use of the United States dollar as the official currency , the absence of direct taxation , a growing financial infrastructure , fast and straightforward company registration procedures , extensive financial freedom and confidentiality .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 9 above , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of [ 102,706,078 dollars gross ( 105,971,529 dollars net ) ] in respect of the period ending 30 June 1996 ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium until payment is effected .  
This environment , in turn , is determined primarily by the monetary , fiscal , trade and other policies of major industrialized countries , by market and technological forces and trends and , for developing countries at least , by the policies pursued by multilateral financial institutions and WTO , as well as by the state of development cooperation in general .  
The above calls for coordination in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies by major industrialized countries to create and sustain conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments and technologies and appropriate knowledge to developing countries , as well as new and additional financial resources .  
In a world of integrated financial markets and rapid capital movements , it is also essential to ensure the soundness of the banking system through prudential regulations , better assessment of credit risks , stringent capital requirements , actions to prevent money laundering , improved management of banks and better regulation of security markets .  
The Council may urge that structural reforms aimed at establishing a competitive domestic financial system , privatization and / or restructuring of public enterprises continue to be implemented in order to enhance the efficient allocation of resources and support private sector development ; such reforms are also expected to boost domestic savings and investment and thereby contribute to higher economic growth .  
As the scale of foreign capital has increased in the financial markets of certain developing countries , these markets have become highly vulnerable to shifts in sentiment among international investors and fund managers , especially since an important part is of a short-term speculative nature .  
The amount of resources potentially available under NAB is roughly $ 47-billion , double the amount that has been available under the General Arrangements to Borrow ( GAB ) , and the number of potential participating countries or monetary authorities with the financial capacity to support the international monetary system has increased to 25 , including a number of developing countries .  
In response to an initiative at the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven , a Working Party of the Group of Ten and emerging market economies is developing , with the support of all relevant institutions , a concerted international strategy to promote the establishment , adoption and implementation of sound principles and policies needed for financial stability . 
Among the contributing factors to this surge in private flows are the high growth rates experienced by many developing countries , the spread of market reforms and , in particular , the deregulation of private capital flows , the liberalization of world trade , the rise of global institutional investors and the accelerating capitalization of emerging markets and their integration into world financial markets .  
The potential negative effects of trade liberalization on the least developed and net food importing countries should be mitigated by increased financial and technical assistance .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts payable shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti until payment is effected .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the combined Forces , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph 9 above , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 87,793,328 dollars gross ( 92,251,479 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1996 ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina until payment is effected .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium until payment is effected .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force until payment is effected .  
The planned improvement of the mechanism of trade and economic relations must provide for the creation of the necessary conditions for developing market-based cooperation , broader access of Russian and Ukrainian capital to each other 's markets , the development of joint investment projects , the formation of transnational financial and industrial groups and the creation of intergovernmental special-purpose programmes .  
Under current trends in global interdependence , international governance would require reaching a global compact on means to enhance job creation at the national level through orderly management of financial and trade flows and through promotion of democratic systems and respect for fundamental labour standards . 
Exploring new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade , and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development will be undertaken .  
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
But the international community , the United Nations system , the multilateral financial institutions , all regional organizations and local authorities , and all actors of civil society also need to contribute their own share of efforts and resources to promote social development and to reduce inequalities among people and narrow the gap between developed and developing countries .  
To ensure effective decentralization and strengthening of local authorities and their association / networks , Governments , at the appropriate levels , should review and revise , as necessary , legislation to increase local autonomy and participation in decision-making , implementation , and resource mobilization and use , especially with respect to human , technical and financial resources and local enterprise development , within the overall framework of a national economic , social and environmental strategy .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
To that end , international support , through appropriate technical cooperation and financial assistance by developed countries and multilateral financial and development institutions is needed to enhance the capacity of the landlocked developing countries to effectively participate in the rapidly globalizing world economy , including global trading , investment and technology transfer processes .  
It is critical to generate the political will to mobilize and make available the necessary resources - public and private , financial and human , national and international - if all States , the United Nations system and the international community as a whole are to mount a full and effective response to this Agenda .  
All countries should explore new ways of generating new public and private financial resources , inter alia , through the appropriate reduction of excessive military expenditures , including global military expenditures and the arms trade and investments for arms production and acquisition , taking into consideration national security requirements , so as to allow possible allocation of additional funds for social and economic development .  
The international community , including the international financial institutions , is invited to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth without falling into a new debt crisis .  
In this context , the international community should explore ways to broaden appropriate enhanced cooperation and , where appropriate , coordination of macroeconomic policy among interested countries , monetary and financial authorities and institutions , so as to enhance preventive consultation arrangements between such institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries , taking into account the needs of developing countries as well as situations that may have a significant impact on the international financial system .  
UNDP has played a key role in the development of a common understanding of the programme approach which is now contained in the Operational Activities Reference Manual published in 1996 by the Consultative Committee on Programme and Operational Questions ( CCPOQ ) with significant substantive and financial support from UNDP . 
As indicated in the report on follow-up to the decisions taken by the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 1996 , CCPOQ , with considerable substantive and financial assistance from UNDP , published an operational activities reference manual , which has now been forwarded to all country offices and will serve as a unifying framework within which each agency will operate using its own detailed operational procedures .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base , and recent natural disasters ,  
It is of the utmost importance that the Commission be granted the necessary financial means to start operating as soon as possible , in order to maintain the current momentum in favour of clarifying the past so that the country can move forward in the daunting tasks of national reconstruction and reconciliation .  
The second option would be to deploy a United Nations peacekeeping force , composed mainly of African contingents provided with adequate military capability and with sufficient financial and logistical support to fulfil the challenging tasks entrusted to it .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub _ Commission , in its decision 1996 / 114 , mindful of the need for and merit of having a consolidated set of the rules of procedure that are fully applicable to it , decided to entrust Mr . Ribot Hatano with the task of preparing , without financial implications , a working paper relating to the methods of work of the Sub _ Commission , to be submitted to it at its forty _ ninth session as a basis for discussion , which would contain :  
The Committee recommended the establishment of specific machinery located at the highest policy level , with adequate financial and human resources , that would coordinate and guide action in favour of women , would be able to prevent the persistence of attitudes , prejudices and stereotypes that discriminate against women and would narrow the gap between de jure and de facto equality .  
Referring to Recommendation No .  3 of the Committee 's eighth session , in which the Committee invited the Director-General to examine the possibility of establishing an international fund intended to facilitate the restitution of stolen or illicitly exported cultural objects in cases where the countries concerned are unable to meet the related financial costs ,  
The inventory of financial needs and the data base of financial sources would have the following characteristics in order to ensure their effective use : ( i ) available to participants in the CCD consultative processes ; ( ii ) disseminated through various channels , including the Internet ; ( iii ) packaged to meet the needs of customers ; and ( iv ) frequently updated .  27 .  Inventory of financial requirements .  
While it was true that developing countries bore the primary responsibility for solving their human settlements problems , the international community , and the developed countries in particular , should endeavour to create a favourable international environment for the development of human settlements by providing sufficient financial resources and technologies to the developing countries .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
Given the severe and irreversible health effects of lead poisoning , particularly on children , it is important to accelerate the process of eliminating unsafe uses of lead , including the use of lead in gasoline worldwide , in light of country-specific conditions and with enhanced international support and assistance to developing countries , particularly through the timely provision of technical and financial assistance and the promotion of endogenous capacity-building .  
Consideration should be given to the gradual implementation of pricing policies that are geared towards cost recovery and the equitable and efficient allocation of water , including the promotion of water conservation , in developed countries ; such policies could also be considered in developing countries when they reach an appropriate stage in their development , so as to promote the harmonious management and development of scarce water resources and generate financial resources for investment in new water supply and treatment facilities .  
In order to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms , the international community , in particular developed countries , should therefore support the global mechanism that would have the capacity to promote actions leading to the mobilization and channelling of substantial resources for advancing the implementation of the Convention and its regional annexes , and to contribute to the eradication of poverty , which is one of the principal consequences of desertification and drought in the majority of affected countries .  
To resolve the remaining debt problems of the heavily indebted poor countries , creditor and debtor countries and international financial institutions should continue their efforts to find effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the debt problem , including debt relief in the form of debt rescheduling , debt reduction , debt swaps and , as appropriate , debt cancellation , as well as grants and concessional flows that will help restore creditworthiness .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
Indeed , while we applaud the recognition granted to local government in Chapter 28 of Agenda 21 , the two pages in that Chapter hardly reflect the immense financial , infrastructure , administrative and governmental contribution of local Governments to the green and brown agendas or to the agendas of the North and South .  
Specifically , we advocate increased official development assistance , more transparent and democratic financial mechanisms , the transfer of suitable and environmentally benign technologies on concessional terms , the reorientation of technical cooperation to respond to the forces of demand in developing countries in such a way as to utilize and build indigenous expertise , the development of human resources and an improvement in the management systems and processes that run our institutions .  
Accordingly , the developing countries committed themselves to doing everything to preserve and protect the environment , while the developed countries , beyond their ecological obligations , were to provide new and additional financial resources in order to create an international economic environment conducive to the struggle against poverty .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .  
Unfortunately and I repeat , unfortunately the persistent reluctance of the countries of the North to respect their commitments to the developing countries by granting additional financial resources , increasing public development aid to 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and transferring eco-technologies under favourable conditions , is considerably restricting the capacity of these countries to meet the requirements of sustainable development . 
Violations committed on national territory , most of which are considered to be justiciable offences , include : misappropriation of public funds , misuse of company assets , corruption , tax and customs evasion , financial speculation , fraudulent or unlawful enrichment , exploitation of illegal labour and migrant workers , etc .  
In order to achieve the efficient utilization of resources and the streamlined and transparent financial and budgetary procedures envisaged in resolution 49 / 233 , the Special Committee urges the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to develop a coherent strategy for logistic support of peacekeeping operations .  
It should determine specific measures to foster an enabling international environment conducive to providing developing countries with increased financial and technical assistance , access to financial flows on a predictable and assured basis , increased foreign direct investment and a durable solution to debt problems .  
The Seminar pointed out the fundamental contradiction between the increasing restrictions to individual mobility and the free flow of goods and services as encouraged by transnational corporations and international financial institutions .  
The success of collective response to humanitarian crises depends not only on a well _ coordinated and integrated plan of action , but also on the availability of the human , material and financial resources necessary to ensure that timely assistance is provided .  
The Fund has maintained a solid financial standing and has been utilized by operational organizations of the United Nations system on 48 occasions to meet urgent relief requirements .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium until payment is effected .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force until payment is effected .  
They shall take joint actions in international financial and economic organizations with a view to ensuring appropriate funding for projects agreed on at the trilateral level , including requests to make use of the European Union 's integrated international assistance programmes , such as Poland-Hungary Aid for the Reconstruction of the Economy ( PHARE ) and technical assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States ( TACIS ) , as well as appropriate programmes within the framework of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation .  
In paragraph 11 of the resolution the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to convene in 1997 another meeting of governmental experts from land-locked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems in the land-locked and transit developing countries and to explore the possibility of formulating specific action-oriented measures .  
In order to facilitate the review of the progress in the development of transit systems by the above mentioned meeting of governmental experts convened pursuant to paragraph 11 of General Assembly 50 / 97 , the Secretary-General of UNCTAD made arrangements , with the financial support of the UNDP , to undertake comprehensive regional and subregional analytical studies which highlighted recent developments on the transit transport sector of land-locked and transit developing countries and made recommendations for future action .  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
Reaffirms once again the commitment of the international community to continue its technical , economic and financial cooperation with Haiti in support of its economic and social development efforts and in order to strengthen Haitian institutions responsible for dispensing justice and guaranteeing democracy , respect for human rights , political stability and economic development ;  
In addition to expertise and support relating to the political , diplomatic and military aspects of designing and negotiating a disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programme , financial and developmental assistance from the international donor community , humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organizations have proven equally essential .  
In the face of those developments , on 20 July 1997 , Turkey and the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus announced a number of measures which would be implemented towards economic and financial integration to alleviate the effects of the illegal embargoes on the Turkish Cypriots and to forge closer ties in defence and foreign policy with a view to protecting the legitimate interests of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus .  
Recalling General Assembly resolution 46 / 122 of 17 December 1991 by which it established the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund on Contemporary Forms of Slavery to assist representatives of non _ governmental organizations to participate in the deliberations of the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery by providing them with financial assistance and to extend through established channels of assistance , humanitarian , legal and financial aid to individuals whose human rights have been severely violated as a result of contemporary forms of slavery ,  
The International Monitoring Committee to supervise the implementation of the Bangui Agreements , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
This section analyses provisions on financial transfers and mechanisms in recent MEAs ( in particular provisions on " compliance assistance " contained in the Montreal Protocol , the CBD and the FCCC ) , as well as other ways of generating new public and private financial resources to assist developing countries in promoting sustainable development and more particularly in tackling global environmental problems .  
Ensuring " additionality " in JI raises several conceptual and practical questions , including those relating to methods for establishing and calculating baselines , determining emissions reduced or sequestered , financial additionality , and moral hazard ( incentives for parties to a project to exaggerate its impact ) .  
MicroStart provides institutional and capital support to micro finance institutions and networks in 25 pilot countries , thereby increasing direct access to financial services and building on the indigenous economic capacity of poor people and microentrepreneurs .  24 .  UNDP also supported a project on social exclusion that analysed the processes and patterns that prevent people from taking part in the economic and social life of their community .  
Although the world economy was becoming more integrated through trade and other financial flows , and offers mutual benefits and growing opportunities for economic expansion to participating countries , it also generated social dislocation and demands difficult policy adjustments .  
Some of the concerns included the fact that economic policies were increasingly affected by the sentiments of a globalized financial market ; that greater openness also implied greater vulnerability to shocks in the international economic system ; and that heightened international economic competition and greater capital mobility weakened the bargaining position of labour , exerted downward pressure on labour standards and compromised the capacity of Governments to implement countervailing social policies .  
For this purpose , and in order to ensure a broad-based origin and application of such a methodology , the Department of Economic and Social Affairs should convene an ad hoc expert group meeting on the subject in the first half of 1998 , with the participation of both internationally renowned experts in the area and representatives of the relevant organizations both inside and outside the United Nations system , particularly the international financial and trade institutions .  
Major impediments on the supply side are production and export structures that concentrate on only a few products , poor endowment with financial and human capital , weak technological capacity , inadequate legal and regulatory frameworks , and bottlenecks in physical infrastructure . 
It should be noted that , in view of the budgetary austerity and the restrictive monetary and fiscal environment accompanying the structural adjustment of Bulgaria 's economy , effective attainment of the goals of the National Plan of Action would require the extensive cooperation of international organizations and institutions and also financial contributions .  
Successful implementation of the Platform for Action depended on the contribution of all the participants - Governments , civil society and international organizations - and while the primary responsibility for implementation lay at the national level , international cooperation was crucial , particularly with regard to fulfilling commitments to provide financial resources .  
The enormous cost of and rapid change in information and communications technology were posing immense financial and technical difficulties , thus increasing the gap between developed and developing countries in that field .  
The closure had had a negative effect on the economic and social situation of the occupied territories with at least 10 per cent of the population living below the poverty line and the losses resulting from the current closure estimated at more than US $ 6 million a day , which was more than the financial assistance provided by foreign donors .  
Recognizing also that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , and fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements ,  
Strongly urge the industrialized countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources to meet their commitments under and the requirements of Agenda 21 and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent gross national product ( GNP ) as official development assistance immediately , and also to ensure that within that target 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of GNP is earmarked for least developed countries ;  
His delegation looked forward to the special session of the General Assembly for the review of Agenda 21 , which it hoped would provide policy guidelines in the critical areas of sustainable development and adopt measures to achieve sustainable development goals , in particular through the provision of adequate financial resources , the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the creation of institutional mechanisms . 
Other measures taken included the provision of additional developed land and adequate financial assistance , the promotion of energy-saving building materials and cost-effective construction technologies , the upgrading of unusable housing , special programmes for the disadvantaged and for women , programmes linking improved housing to the eradication of poverty , the support for development of the informal sector , the introduction of land reform , and public and private-sector partnerships .  
Today 's cities were faced with a lack of financial resources and socio-economic and demographic pressures ; the gap between rich and poor was widening , providing basic social services was increasingly difficult , health , environmental and security problems were getting worse and unsustainable patterns of production and consumption were becoming widespread . 
A common vision had developed that sound financial and economic policies , including development of human resources and respect for human rights , good governance , individual initiative and the private sector , were critical to creating an environment conducive to economic growth , environmental sustainability and social equity .  
In view of the limited budgetary resources allocated to development , some sectors had shown a marked interest in broadening the purview of the financial institutions and intergovernmental organizations with respect to development issues , which would , in the long run , have the effect of reducing still further the participation of developing countries in the international decision-making process , contrary to the principles of the Charter and to the global dimension which should characterize the solution of the world 's problems .  
For the first time , more than half the gross domestic product had been generated by the private sector , and more favourable conditions for national and foreign investors had been created through the ongoing privatization process , the completion of the first phase of financial stabilization , the gradual liberalization of domestic and foreign trade and the introduction of a new national currency .  
The adverse effects included an increase in poverty , a reduction in the financial resources that were vital for development , the placing in jeopardy of fiscal and monetary policy and economic reform , and an erosion of the capacity of the country targeted to participate fully in world trade and capital markets .  
That was of particular importance in the preparatory process for the World Food Summit , which would deal with the fundamental right of every human being to be free from hunger and malnutrition , international cooperation for the elimination of unilateral economic and trade measures , eradication of poverty , and international mobilization and channelling of technical , technological and financial resources so as to improve access to food for all .  
While his delegation supported the reform of the Economic and Social Council , the reform process would not solve all the problems facing the international community , since institutional reforms must be complemented by a sound resource base for implementing approved strategic and financial plans .  
These mechanisms consist , among others , of annual financial reports , semi-annual reports , quarterly reports , audited reports by internal and external auditors , field visits by agency personnel , regular monitoring by geographical desks , narrative reports on progress , regular operational reporting and meetings , as well as mid-term and final reports on activities and finance ( see table 6 below ) . 
Owing to the increasing globalization of the economy and the interdependence of national economies , the external debt problem must be addressed through a comprehensive , integrated and development-oriented approach , involving an open , rule-based and non-discriminatory international trading system , increased financial flows and increased access to technology .  
Lastly , he endorsed the view expressed in paragraph 51 of the report that limiting the exposure of middle-income countries to the more volatile forms of finance before their economies were ready and maintaining the confidence of international financial investors was central to avoiding new crises , and that while individual countries had a central responsibility in that regard , the international community was also undertaking to play a greater role . 
The efforts of developing countries to mobilize domestic resources should be supported by external resources commensurate with their needs ; accordingly , the depletion of financial assistance agreed and committed by the developed countries , particularly official development assistance , was cause for concern .  
In that regard , the figures contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the net transfer of resources between developing and developed countries ( A / 51 / 291 ) showed the unpredictable and unsustainable nature of financial flows in the international capital markets , which was aggravated by increasing interdependence and financial integration .  
Since debt problems varied considerably from country to country , debt relief measures needed to be adapted to the needs of each case ; to that end , through an evolving debt strategy , the international financial community had contributed significantly to the introduction of improvements in developing countries based on sound economic policies and programmes of adjustment and reform .  
The situation was particularly difficult for the developing countries since the liberalization of their foreign transactions made them increasingly vulnerable to the unpredictable fluctuations of private capital flows in the international financial markets .  
Despite the decisive role of domestic policy in respect of the influx of private capital , it was essential to take measures at the international level to ensure the effectiveness of domestic reforms ; in that respect it should be recalled that , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 50 / 91 , cooperation and coordination must be broadened among interested countries and the Bretton Woods institutions as a means of promoting a stable international financial environment conducive to economic growth , particularly in developing countries .  
She stressed the urgent need for the international community and the multilateral financial institutions to formulate strategies that would significantly reduce the debt stock to a sustainable or manageable level that would not impede the implementation of development programmes or deter investors .  
She hoped , however , that the international community would not limit its efforts to the application of that initiative but would also propose solutions that were suitable to the developing countries , especially the least developed ones , so that they could use their national financial resources to undertake economic reforms that were vital for their development .  85 .  Mr . OUCH ( Cambodia ) said that he fully supported the statement made by the representative of Costa Rica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China .  
The Government of the United States of America has not only deliberately ignored the opinion and decisions of the international community and the purposes and principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations , but has also decided to step up its economic , commercial and financial blockade against Cuba , in this case by means of the law known as the Helms-Burton Act , whose scope exceeds that of all previous legislation by grouping together , intensifying and conferring legal status on all earlier measures and provisions relating to the blockade . 
The International Monitoring Committee , acting on behalf of MISAB and / or on its own behalf , maintains regular contacts with international organizations , including UNDP and foreign diplomatic missions based in Bangui , with a view to requesting their diplomatic , financial and material support for mediation initiatives in the Central African Republic .  
At its sixth session , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice again discussed the smuggling of illegal migrants . 47 Members of the Commission noted that the smuggling of illegal migrants not only caused mental and physical harm and financial hardship to the illegal migrants , but also affected the social stability and bilateral relations of the countries involved . 
It needs to be questioned to what extent this secrecy is compatible with the access to information necessary for democratic practice and social justice and whether , in some cases , instead of contributing to long-term security , it may conceal information about processes ( ecological , financial , military , etc . ) which are a potential threat to everyone and which need therefore to be addressed collectively . 
For example , financial contributions to relevant multilateral institutions and programmes were often not reported , many national communications provided limited detail on bilateral programmes related to the implementation of the Convention , and there was little discussion of transfer of technology through the private sector . 
If the Council approved his recommendations , the Secretary-General intended to dispatch a technical team to the mission area during the first half of October 1997 to reassess the resources required for the deployment of MINURSO at full strength and would revert to the Council in November , with a comprehensive report including a detailed plan , timetable and financial implications for the holding of the referendum of self-determination and fulfilment of the United Nations objectives in Western Sahara . 
In general , receiving departments have accepted the Investigations Section \ x { e5b8 } recommendations , but implementation is delayed for reasons that include the need to obtain additional legal advice on implementation methods and processes ; administrative and / or disciplinary processes are begun that take protracted periods of time ; financial implications are assessed ; and all due process requirements are observed .

After years of living under centrally planned regimes where the private sector hardly existed as in the countries of eastern and central Europe and the former Soviet Union most fledgling entrepreneurs lacked financial and business experience and the facilities were not available for them to start operating .  
As a result , the Organizations financial situation today is characterized by continuing arrearage levels in absolute terms ; mounting arrearage levels in relative terms ; continuing shortages and persistent intervals of regular budget cash deficits ; prolonged periods and increasing levels of borrowing from peacekeeping cash for regular budget purposes ; and persistent levels of debt to Member States for troops and equipment .  
As a result of that practice , the Organization 's financial situation was characterized by continuing levels of arrears in absolute terms and mounting levels of arrears in relative terms ; continuing shortages and persistent intervals of regular budget cash deficits ; prolonged periods and increasing levels of borrowing from peacekeeping cash for regular budget purposes ; and persistent levels of debt to Member States for troops and equipment .  3 .  At the end of September 1997 , preliminary figures for unpaid assessments for the regular budget , peacekeeping operations and the international tribunals totalled $ 2.417-billion .  
Many countries acknowledged that the root causes of the continuing financial crisis were , on the one hand , a poorly thought out and excessive expansion of the scope of United Nations activities during the previous decade , which had had an adverse impact on the effectiveness of the activities of almost all the specialized agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations , and , on the other hand , the unjust apportionment of the Organization 's expenses among its Member States .  
Despite the severe economic difficulties brought about by the unjust economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States against Cuba , her Government had paid the sum of $ 1.193-million to the Organization during the previous week ; that was a reflection of Cuba 's commitment to the Organization .  
Promote and co-operate in providing the necessary financial and technological resources for the sustainable management , conservation and enhancement , as appropriate , of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol , including biomass , forests and oceans as well as other terrestrial , coastal and marine ecosystems .  
Promote and co-operate in providing the necessary financial and technological resources for the full , open and prompt exchange of relevant scientific , technological , technical , socio-economic and legal information related to the climate system and climate change , and to the economic and social consequences of various response strategies , including through the establishment of relevant mechanisms for this purpose in the subsidiary bodies of the Convention .  
In the opinion of the Government of Cuba , unilateral coercive measures are also blatantly interventionist and discriminatory and are applied through a wide range of economic instruments , basically related to trade , financial , technological or investment restrictions , which in any of their variants are designed to cause a critical economic situation that will force the State concerned to change the policy or policies objected to by the State applying the measures .  
Since recovering its full independence in 1959 , Cuba has been subjected to all manner of coercive measures , characterized by pressure , threats and hostilities whose stated purpose is to subvert the political , economic and social alternative chosen by the Cuban people in exercise of their sovereignty .  The clearest expression of this increasingly aggressive conduct is the permanent economic , commercial and financial blockade unilaterally imposed against Cuba for almost four decades by the Government of the United States of America , involving an endless list of various types of coercive economic measures .  
Under those circumstances , the international community has shown its recognition of the urgent need for the creation of a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system through the adoption of various resolutions and agreements at all levels . 
Given a wide variety of types of sanctions , all cases were divided into three categories : ( a ) limited , that is , minor financial , export , cultural or travel sanctions ; ( b ) moderate , that is , broader trade or financial sanctions ; and ( c ) extensive , that is , comprehensive trade and financial sanctions .  
IPA will be promoted through various means : first , by ensuring that inter-ministerial national drug-control commissions are fully involved in operational activities , thus strengthening their coordination and planning functions ; secondly , by promoting planning and operational linkages with Governments , agencies in the United Nations system , international financial institutions , and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations through the incorporation of the drug dimension into mainstream socio-economic development programmes ; and thirdly , by fostering broader social awareness of the deleterious political , social and economic consequences of drug abuse and the illicit drug industry .  
The drug dimension was incorporated with UNDCP assistance into mainstream national health , education , social welfare , critical poverty and rural development programmes , by elaborating new drug-control partnerships with sectoral ministries , relevant United Nations organizations , international financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , private industry and other partners .  
Similarly , most UNDCP technical and financial resources for alternative development in the Andean region no longer support a wide range of isolated model projects , but rather aim at strengthening the institutional capacities of national alternative development entities and their programmes .  
Activities will encompass the provision of advisory services to Governments ; assistance for the introduction of relevant legislation , such as promoting mutual legal assistance ; support to improve the capacity of legal and related law enforcement systems , including the establishment of financial intelligence units or similar bodies ; organization of major international training events ; applied research into economic and legal aspects of the problem , and further development of the AMLID database system .

In the interests of prudent financial management , up to half of the value of conditional pledges from Governments and firm pledges made by organizations of established repute are recognized as income at the time the pledge is received .  
In developing countries and in western financial capitals , there is now a growing acceptance that premature liberalization of capital markets has been a primary cause of the current crisis .  
We believe that this should be linked to a new system of international financial markets which would be more transparent and efficient and thus responsive and adaptable to the changing financial conditions in the world markets .  
Therefore , we support the search for effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and monetary fluctuations in order to ensure fair competition and to organize financial transactions on sound and solid bases .  
Our interdependence is increasing through international legally binding commitments , the adoption of policies reaching across national borders , enhanced trade and financial flows , and markets which have become fully integrated on a global scale .  
Much concern has been expressed about the devastating social consequences of the current financial crisis , particularly massive unemployment , the loss of health and educational services , and the consequent increase in poverty in affected countries .

There is , however , a continuing need for strong action in this area since small island developing States remain constrained by limited financial , human and technical resources .  
The Special Committee had considered practical steps to ensure that future peacekeeping operations would have a sound logistical and predictable financial basis .  
The vast financial and human resources available to the illicit drugs trade , in many cases exceeding the resources of national Governments , have made international cooperation and coordination imperative to an effective anti-drugs strategy .  
Furthermore , the distribution of private financial flows to the developing countries had remained highly uneven , so that the rapid growth of foreign direct investment did not represent a growing benefit for all the developing countries .  
There is , however , a continuing need for strong action in this area because small island developing States remain constrained by limited financial , human and technical resources .  
This objective can be served by multilateral mechanisms that monitor all national economic policies affecting international capital flows and other monetary and financial variables .  
The vast financial and human resources available to the illicit drugs trade , in many cases exceeding the resources of national Governments , have made international cooperation and coordination imperative for an effective anti-drugs strategy .  
Where a countrys capacity to develop and implement a comprehensive economic programme has been disrupted by conflict , consideration must be given to relaxing the normally strict financial conditions imposed by international lending institutions .  
We appeal to all parties at the global , regional and country levels to ensure that adequate financial resources are forthcoming so that the immense potential of volunteer contributions , now and into the next century , are fully realised .

Four main drivers may be identified : ( i ) regulations and market _ based instruments ; ( ii ) education , information and public pressure ; ( iii ) economic and financial considerations ; and ( iv ) tax policy .  
Tax administrators from developing and transitional economy countries encounter considerable difficulties in understanding the controversial taxation issues involved in , for example , transfer pricing mechanisms and innovative financial instruments .  
The evaluations show that a major factor for achieving positive results is the availability of a critical mass of financial resources in order for the national programmes that the United Nations system is supporting to be effective .  
The need to set indigenous language literacy teaching within a well _ defined legal , administrative , financial and technical framework would appear to be self _ evident .  
But it is self-evident that our national and international commitment , as well as limited human financial and material resources , mandates bilateral and regional cooperation in battling the better-equipped narco-traffickers .  
While global financial integration had its positive aspects , it posed enormous challenges to some developing countries , particularly in view of the fluctuating international financial markets .  
If the benefits of the free movement of capital flows are to be retained , the problems of financial instability and negative socio-economic effects of financial turmoil need to be addressed at the national and international levels .

First , obstacles or barriers ( including political , legal , bureaucratic , physical , financial , social and informational ) should be reduced .  
Ongoing civil and international conflicts , financial crises and natural disasters around the world ( including volcanic eruptions , hurricanes , tidal waves and floods ) have had severe impacts on the efficacy and efficiency in the delivery of social services .  
Bocalandro ( Argentina ) said that the current critical social situation which was due to unsuitable industrial structures , excessive bureaucracy and structural adjustments had been aggravated by the international financial crisis .  
His delegation supported the phasing out of gratis personnel and their replacement by international civil servants , and was opposed to any arbitrary financial ceiling that might adversely affect backstopping of peacekeeping operations .

Despite economic hardships exacerbated by the illegal economic , commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America , Cubas Government continued to devote a significant and growing proportion of its budget to social protection programmes .  
It was also apparent that prudential norms and strong supervisory capacity were required as much for facilitating efficient international intermediation of volatile capital flows as they were for an efficient domestic financial system .  
Institutional constraints normally linked to weak capital markets and inadequate regulations should be addressed in order to strengthen the confidence of investors , both domestic and foreign , and decrease the volatility of financial flows .  
A sound financial sector , good governance , broad-based social investments , respect for human rights , and transparency in both the public and private sector were factors at the national level conducive to economic and social growth and development .

There are many obstacles to resolving the acute problems and to raising public awareness of the need to protect the environment during the current period of financial difficulties and economic instability coupled with poverty and weak discipline .  
An enabling external financial environment to support domestic measures could require , inter alia , adequate and transparent supervision of volatile , short-term capital flows .  
He said that the current economic outlook for Africa was not encouraging , as the region was suffering from the effects of the international financial crisis , reduced export demand and falling commodity prices .  
Ad hoc requests by international agencies lead to ad hoc data collection , crowding out limited financial and human resources , and thus interfering with regular national statistical programmes ;

The need for preferential market access treatment remained strong , especially in the light of the economic slump in several dynamic developing countries as a result of the global financial crisis .  
In order to consider adequately the financial feasibility of the proposals and the likelihood of subsequent increases in the proposed prices , additional criteria may need to be considered , such as the costs for design and construction activities ; annual operation and maintenance costs ; present value of capital costs and operating costs ; and the amount of subsidy , if any , expected from the Government .  
Although the prime responsibility for the execution of regional programmes and projects rests with small island developing States Governments , in view of the meagre resources of individual small island developing States and the high costs of regional programmes there is an obvious need for adequate financial support from the international community for timely and effective implementation of regional programmes .  
Owing to the difficulties experienced by the UNOSOM administration during the life of the Operation which were attributable to the complexity of the political , military and security situation in the mission area , compounded by the magnitude of the residual administrative and financial tasks involved , the originally envisaged time-frame for the completion of the Operations liquidation process proved unrealistic .

However , despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of developing countries , including Mozambique , had implemented structural adjustment programmes , liberalized their economies and undertaken other reforms which had had serious social consequences , financial resource flows had diminished , resulting in a vicious circle of economic stagnation and financial crisis .  
To that end , international cooperation would have to be intensified by improving trade relations and access to markets , sharing new technologies , creating a favourable international financial and economic order and allocating increased development resources to developing countries .  
The current financial crisis , caused by massive inflows of private capital and their sudden reversal , had , however , forced the Committee to view the implications of private capital flows into developing countries from a completely different perspective .  
The current global financial crisis and the reduction in foreign investment capital flows had coincided with the implementation of an economic reform policy in Egypt which included a stabilization and restructuring process aimed at attracting investment capital flows and establishing a modern financial infrastructure , as well as the development of the banking sector and the creation of a stock exchange , again with a view to attracting investment and promoting privatization .

The financing of development was a much bigger concern than the establishment of a new international financial system or the strengthening of the existing one , for it touched on the core requirement of development , namely , financing and encompassed a host of interrelated issues , including the mobilization of domestic resources ; development cooperation and official development assistance ; and the resources generated from trade and other export services .

Most developing countries encounter enormous difficulties in providing timely responses to the demands and to implement the substantive objectives of most instruments and conventions and in putting into practice their compliance requirements , due to their limited institutional and financial capacity , lack of manpower and managerial skills and inadequate or non-enforced national legislative frameworks to support these instruments .  
Such issues as trade , market access and transparency , and economic , environmental and social policies which directly or indirectly affect the forest sector , as well as governance and corruption , private investment , financial resources and transfer of technology , need to be addressed in an integrated manner to achieve efficiency and effective results . 
Second , financial aspects , recognizing that it is very difficult to rely on mobilizing domestic financial resources in very poor and populous countries where natural resources are degraded , and international cooperation will need to play a very key role .  
This would be accomplished by capitalizing on existing and potential public and private-sector financial resources , primarily at the global level , with a specific view to leveraging higher levels of private sector finance .  
The financial needs of developing countries with low forest cover require special consideration , balancing their genuine need for forest products and services with ecological , technical , financial and social feasibility .

Failure in the implementation of policies for forest conservation and protected areas , because of inadequate coordination or existence of conflicting polices and practices , inappropriate implementation strategies or a lack of institutional financial and human resources , is widely acknowledged as a major reason for the failure to achieve forest conservation goals in some countries .  
Urge bilateral and international cooperation / development agencies and financial institutions to provide adequate resources to support the achievement of objectives of forest conservation , including protected forest areas , through institutional strengthening and capacity-building , research and education , access to and transfer of technology , technical and scientific cooperation , and community education and extension .  
While stabilization strategy is designed to calm financial and economic turbulence by curbing high inflation rates and curtailing enormous budget deficits in the short term , structural adjustment is aimed at restructuring the productive capacities in order to increase efficiency and help restore growth and , therefore , extends over the medium and long term .

In its assessment of UNDP financial risks , the international consulting firm engaged by the Administrator advised that organizations such as UNDP , which do not have access to the capital markets nor the ability to borrow from banks to cover periodic cash flow needs , should maintain in liquidity the equivalent of 6 to 12 months ' expenditure as a prudent level .  
In explaining the link between those key documents , the Executive Director emphasized the importance of distinguishing between the funding target of the MTP , which was intended to be a financial challenge , and the more conservative financial plan , which was based on a careful analysis of projected income and used for country programme and support budget allocations .  
The Greek Cypriot administration , which tries to present itself as the champion of conservation of cultural heritage , continues , on the one hand , to show utter contempt for what is left of the Turkish-Islamic heritage in South Cyprus , where Ottoman Turkish shrines are under threat of disintegration due to total neglect , and , on the other hand , systematically blocks the flow of any external financial or technical assistance to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus for conservation purposes .  
For the developing countries to be able to extricate themselves from the poverty , hunger , gross social inequality and other negative factors impeding their development , the developed countries should reverse the downward trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) flows , increase their support for aid programmes , and fulfil commitments made at conferences and other forums to provide financial resources for development .  
Under those circumstances , the international community was currently engaged in searching for an appropriate architecture for the international financial system , which should include the following basic elements : better regulation and supervision in all countries , based on a common set of norms ; better information and transparency ; and more effective surveillance .  
In that connection , Tunisia supported the establishment of effective multilateral mechanisms to control international capital flows and currency fluctuations with the aim of ensuring fair competition and organizing financial operations on sound and solid bases .

Discussions around financial resources in IPF and IFF have also included such issues as effective private sector involvement ; integration with national policies and priorities and effective coordination ; the application of economic instruments and tax policies ; the mobilization of national financial resources ; and the possibility of finding a mechanism to raise funds to establish a forest fund dedicated to support activities aimed at sustainable forest management .  
Such negative attitudes often lead to passive or hidden discrimination against migrants , and recourse to civil remedies is constrained by the difficulty of proving formal violation of rights and the financial cost involved in the legal procedures .  
The Department of Social Affairs had also tried to reduce poverty by providing financial assistance to private institutions , food assistance to primary school children and children of poor families , financial and technical assistance to groups of poor families and other social welfare recipients undertaking economic activities , and by providing assistance to the children of the unemployed .

In view of the current financial turmoil afflicting some developing countries and also in view of the next round of WTO negotiations , which were likely to deal with complex issues , the issues raised by the Group of 77 should not be lost in the preparatory process or during UNCTAD X .  
While it was true that financial mediation systems were needed , and that economic activity implied a certain degree of commercial activity , it should nevertheless be remembered that microcredit functioned at the level of the individual household , existed in a natural form and was not intended to transform poor women into economic agents like their counterparts in developed countries .  
Prompt and decisive action was needed to halt the decline in living standards in countries which had fallen prey to the global financial crisis , and Governments must enact policies to expand economic opportunities quickly for disadvantaged households and communities , and make them less vulnerable to future shocks .  
On the basis of the current formula , the operational reserve was set at the level of $ 200-million in 1997 and would be calculated for the biennium 1998-1999 at the level of $ 180-million , based on the resource projection presented to the Executive Board in the annual review of the financial situation , 1997 ( DP / 1998 / 29 ) .  
At a meeting with me , on 11 December 1998 , an ECOWAS ministerial delegation on the Guinea-Bissau issues reiterated that ECOWAS needed logistical and financial support in order to proceed with the speedy deployment of the ECOMOG interposition force , the key operational support instrument for the implementation of the Agreement on the ground .  The delegation emphasized the importance of United Nations / ECOWAS collaboration and asked me to appoint a representative in that country .  
It should also be emphasized that another of its objectives was to forestall the financial crisis facing the existing social security institutions in the medium term , and thereby ensure that their income would be sufficient to meet their obligations to pensioners and their administrative costs .  
The services recognized by this Act are of three kinds : ( a ) financial , such as cash payments , pensions , etc . ; ( b ) in kind , such as prosthetic and orthopaedic appliances , medicines and mechanical aids ; and ( c ) services of an assistance nature , such as medical , dental , surgical services , tests , etc .  
Furthermore , the network of the Centre for Initiatives and Advancement for Women , as part of a project receiving financial support from the European Union , is promoting an improvement in the status of women by increasing their active participation in the countrys development and thus affording equal opportunities for women to contribute effectively to national economic , social , cultural and political processes , placing special emphasis on rural areas .  
The project has already commissioned case studies of recent experiences in Indonesia , Sri Lanka and the Philippines and has identified key factors for successful residential photovoltaic programmes and ways to overcome the financial and institutional barriers to the use of solar power .  
It was emphasized that international agencies engaged in the provision of technical and financial assistance should take fully into account the fundamental role of criminal justice systems in the achievement of social development and economic growth .  
It stands to reason , therefore , that henceforth international security will be built more and more around the concept of international civil society in which , along with governments , international organizations , economic and financial institutions , an ever more prominent role will be played by citizens and their spokesmen _ the non _ governmental organizations . 
Such a mechanism should be written into the rules and conditions governing international financial contracts , in order to promote a better assessment of risks , eliminate irresponsible behaviour and reduce speculative short-term capital flows to emerging markets . 
With regard to the volatility of financial flows , he said that while the amount of those flows to the developing countries had increased from $ 100-billion in 1990 to over $ 250-billion in 1996 , they were composed almost entirely of private capital and were concentrated in a limited number of developing countries .  
In that context , it was important to explore the many proposals put forward , including that of the Intergovernmental Group of 24 on International Monetary Affairs on the establishment of a task force of developed and developing countries to design a more effective surveillance mechanism for international financial and capital flows , as well as improved national information systems .  
Global financial integration had helped to generate a massive expansion of private capital flows to some developing countries , but also posed enormous challenges to national financial and banking systems in terms of ensuring the sustainability of those flows .  
The recent financial turmoil had shown that countries must maintain constant vigilance over all economic , financial and institutional parameters in order to guard against the volatility of other markets and contagion effects , and that each country needed not only sound macroeconomic fundamentals , but also a strong financial and banking system with adequate supervisory and regulatory mechanisms , transparency and good governance .  
The European Union recognized that external debt overhang remained a major obstacle to sustainable development in many poor developing countries and that solutions must continue to be sought to prevent the burden of debt service from offsetting the benefits of reforms in those countries and to ensure their access to financial markets .  
Mr . Amorim ( Brazil ) , speaking also on behalf of the members and associate members of the Common Market of the Southern Cone ( MERCOSUR ) , said that the worsening of the crisis in the international financial markets threatened to seriously reduce global economic activity and employment .  
The leaders of the MERCOSUR countries had been stressing for some time the need to promote closer cooperation between monetary authorities at the global level , better coordination of the macroeconomic policies of countries which had the greatest impact on international finances , proper supervision of agents in international financial markets and stabilization of currencies that were the subject of speculation .  
His Government believed that deregulation in the national financial sector should not be carried to the extreme of absolute laissez-faire , that foreign direct investment was of particular interest to the developing countries , although it should be adapted to the social , economic and environmental priorities of the receiving country , and that it was not easy to distinguish between unstable flows and long-term investment , which should be promoted .  
Ms . Cardoze ( Panama ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , said that the consequences for the Rio Group region of the global financial crisis which had begun during the previous year had included a decrease of two percentage points in the growth rate of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , a decline in imports and exports , particularly of raw materials and semi-manufactured products , an increase in the current account deficit and , in some cases , a decrease in international reserves .  
The declining trend in official development assistance ( ODA ) and the increasingly frequent imposition of conditions of an economic and financial or a political , legal or humanitarian nature had forced many developing countries to resort to private capital flows , which had been concentrated in a small number of countries and had proved unstable and crisis-prone .  
Furthermore , pending the revision of paragraphs ( f ) and ( g ) of financial rule 110.19 as called for in General Assembly resolution 52 / 226 , paragraph 18 , he had issued a memorandum in April 1998 to ensure that the procurement of professional supplies , medicines , medical supplies , hospital or surgical supplies and prosthetic appliances were no longer exempt from competitive bidding .  
The alternative approach that was suggested ( i.e . , the inclusion of an open-ended provision describing such financial practices in sufficiently broad terms to cover existing practices and future developments ) was found to be impractical in view of the difficulty of describing a wide range of heterogeneous and rapidly changing practices with sufficient precision .  
It recognized , however , the need to extend sympathetic understanding to Member States temporarily unable to meet their financial obligations owing to genuine economic difficulties .  
The additional resources would enable the Secretary-General to make available an expanded range of programmes aimed at building and strengthening core organizational and managerial competencies ; to provide greater opportunities for staff at all levels to upgrade specific technical and substantive skills ; to support the decentralization of human and financial resource management responsibilities ; and to strengthen career support mechanisms .  
New modular programmes would be introduced to build specific core and managerial competencies and to build requisite skills for managing human and financial resources in a decentralized environment with increased delegation of authority and accountability ;  
Specifically , Member States will have received timely and effective assistance upon request to deal with new crime challenges , especially transnational organized crime , trafficking in human beings , economic and financial crimes and corruption .  
The Programme will provide advisory services to the judicial , financial and law enforcement sectors at the national level , as well as data and analysis of money-laundering issues and trends so that Member States will be aware of pressing issues , formulate and implement adequate policies to fight effectively against money-laundering .  
Concerned States will be assisted to secure adequate financial and technical assistance and support for their alternative development programmes , particularly from the international financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , relevant United Nations organizations and the private sector .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
The Report commented that effective national insolvency regimes contribute to crisis prevention by providing the predictable legal framework needed to address the financial difficulties of troubled firms before the accumulated financial difficulties of the corporate sector spill over into an economy-wide payments crisis .  
In view of the crisis with regard to private capital flows and the further decline in official development assistance ( ODA ) since 1997 , it will be necessary to again demonstrate that ODA is a main source of external funding for developing countries , particularly those in Africa and the least developed countries , and that the fulfilment of all financial commitments of Agenda 21 must be an integral part of the ODA reform discussion .  
While ongoing efforts to reform the international financial architecture and improve economic management will reduce the risks of future crises , there is growing recognition of the need to proceed , in parallel , with efforts to strengthen social policies and institutions , including industrial relations systems and institutions for social dialogue .  
The unacceptable and unsustainable social costs of recent financial crises have stimulated intensive discussion during the past months within the United Nations system , including the World Bank , on principles of good social policy to be applied at both national and international levels .  
However , with growth of output in Africa projected to slow to about 2 per cent in 1999 below the level of population growth this modest recovery is already being threatened by international financial crises , declining commodity prices and regional conflicts .  
As noted in document E / CN . 5 / 1999 / 4 , although the multilateral financial institutions have acknowledged the importance of protecting or compensating the poor for the adverse effects of adjustment measures , the poor nevertheless continue to bear the brunt of hardships arising from macroeconomic and structural adjustment .  
In the face of acute budgetary constraints in many developing countries and transition economies , intensified by the worldwide financial crisis , efforts to improve financing of the social sector must be seen in the perspective of a host of competing claims upon national treasuries . 
The Commission also underscored that enhanced financing of social development requires a strong political commitment by the international community , as well as well focused efforts to mobilize human and financial resources .  
Aside from the mobilization of domestic and international financial resources , effective implementation must be based on comprehensive strategic thinking , including a clear identification of capacities and constraints at national and international levels .  
While a critical analysis of the contribution of the 20 / 20 initiative to the promotion of basic social services was urged , interested parties also underscored that the initiative leads to the combination of efforts of both donors and recipients of aid in a most visible way , matching domestic funds with an equal amount of foreign financial resources .  
Having committed themselves to a domestically based strategy to achieving more balanced growth , reducing imbalances and supporting recovery in emerging market economies , the Group also pledged strong cooperation to promote stability of the international monetary system and announced the launching of a financial stability forum to help avert future global crisis . 
Recent cases of international capital flight from developing countries , which have created tremendous strains and increased poverty , have been attributed in part to shortcomings in domestic policies and institutions , for example , but they can also be seen as symptomatic of an international financial system which fails to differentiate satisfactorily the performance of individual developing countries .  
The goal of the partnership , which consists of Governments , UNAIDS co-sponsoring agencies , bilateral organizations , non-governmental organizations and the private sector , is to mobilize Governments and organizations of civil society to redirect and expand national and international political , programme and financial commitments and action to address the epidemic and its impact on life and the potential for socio-economic development in Africa .  
The study found that while weak financial infrastructure , financial liberalization and speculation were to blame for the crisis , if reliable accounting information had been available , excessive financial exposure would have been detected earlier , permitting corrective action to be taken , and thus possibly diminishing the magnitude of the crisis .  
Advisory services to strengthen the technical capacity of over 50 developing countries and countries with economies in transition to record and monitor their external debt , including institutional legal and administrative issues , and training in the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System and debt management ; and on capital market development , financial risk management , greenhouse emissions trading , and clean development mechanism .  
Sudden inflows and equally sudden outflows of foreign capital create considerable difficulties for the management of domestic monetary policy ; 27 the resulting uncertainty and higher risks implied by financial volatility lead to caution on the part of Governments ( which tend to set interest rates higher than they might otherwise have been ) and of private business ( faced with increased costs of capital and increased uncertainty over future demand ) .  
More direct controls , such as those employed in Chile , would help to contain the disruptive effects of surges in short-term capital flows on economic growth , which if successful would actually make the environment more attractive for longer-term direct investment . 37 It should also be stressed that most transition economies possess extremely small financial sectors in relation to global capital flows , most of which come from the more advanced market economies . 
As the fallout from the initial financial crisis in Thailand enters its third year , weak international trade and the negligible improvement in private financial inflows mean that most developing and transition economies continue to face a tight external payments constraint .  
IS1.2 All revenue from staff assessment not otherwise disposed of by specific resolution of the General Assembly is credited to the Tax Equalization Fund established by the Assembly in its resolution 973 A ( X ) of 15 December 1955 .  Member States are given credit in that Fund in accordance with the scale of assessments for the regular budget applicable to the financial year concerned .  
Reaffirms the particular importance of the right of the child to education and the goals of Education for All , emphasizing the need for governments to broaden and constantly redefine the scope of basic education , including early childhood care and initial education , to develop a supporting policy context and to mobilize existing and new financial and human resources , including through concerted international action and cooperation ; 37 .  Calls upon States :  
Requests the Secretary _ General , the United Nations specialized agencies and the regional economic commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stresses that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions ;  
While the process of adapting from the television analog system to the digital standard has its financial implications in terms of capital investment in production equipment upgrade , the potential benefits for the effective dissemination of visual information are enormous .  
Notes that the programme of advisory services and technical assistance does not have sufficient funds to provide any substantial financial assistance to national projects that have a direct impact on the realization of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law in countries that are committed to those ends , but which face economic hardship ;  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the latest episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation do deteriorate further , and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily _ indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Despite having adopted outward looking strategies and liberal market oriented policies for integration in the global economy , many of them are suffering economic setbacks as a result of the continuing turmoil in financial and currency markets .  
This was due to a combination of different factors including , inter alia , inadequate knowledge by national staff of financial management practices and of government and donor procedures as well as insufficient monitoring and supervision at the national level .  10 .  For the 87 programmes that were ongoing on 1 January 1999 , the total expenditure rates are generally higher the earlier the programme started , with some exceptions .  
In this context , the additional resources would enable the Secretary-General to make available an expanded range of programmes aimed at building and strengthening core organizational and managerial competencies ; to provide greater opportunities for staff at all levels to upgrade specific technical and substantive skills ; to support decentralization of human and financial resource management responsibilities and to strengthen career support mechanisms .  
The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section during previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
Requests the Secretary _ General , the United Nations specialized agencies and the regional economic commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stresses that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions ;  
Reaffirms the particular importance of the right of the child to education and the goals of Education for All , emphasizing the need for governments to broaden and constantly redefine the scope of basic education , including early childhood care and initial education , to develop a supporting policy context and to mobilize existing and new financial and human resources , including through concerted international action and cooperation ; 37 .  Calls upon States :  
There is , therefore , a need for the Council to consider arrangements to allow additional funding through either bilateral or multilateral sources , over and above those made under the programme , still subject to existing financial controls established by relevant decisions of the Council .  
Given earlier experiences with international initiatives regarding African diversification , it can be expected that this approach and the preparatory phase will provide a better and more substantive base for the generation of financial and technical support , and equip the entrepreneurs in closing the connectivity gap that exists between them and the world markets .  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
The Commission expresses its profound concern over the grave situation of attacks against human rights defenders and deplores the lack of effective judicial investigations into such crimes as well as the absence of effective legal , administrative , security and financial measures to protect those social and human rights defenders who find themselves at risk .  
The Trust Fund so established is open to voluntary financial contributions from States , inter-governmental organizations , regional economic integration organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations as well as natural and juridical persons .  
Calling for common action to tackle development challenges arising from globalization and the adverse effects of the financial crisis , ACC members committed themselves to working together to monitor the impact of the crisis on societies and individuals , help individual countries carry out the necessary structural and institutional reforms , and strengthen or build basic social services , livelihood opportunities and safety nets for the least fortunate .  
In its resolution S-20 / 4 , entitled Measures to enhance international cooperation to counter the world drug problem , the Assembly set out specific actions to be taken by Member States and by UNDCP and called for UNDCP to play a catalytic role in mobilizing international financial institutions , non-governmental organizations , United Nations organizations and the private sector for work on the drug problem and for assisting interested Governments .  
Seen in relation to the total annual appropriations for ESA programmes and other national programmes , the financial leeway for full implementation of a revised space policywith respect to previous commitments to such programmesis relatively limited , at least in the short term .  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Transitional Administration and the Support Group , they shall be credited their respective share of the remaining unencumbered balance of 14,646,100 dollars gross ( 13,906,700 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1998 ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the Civilian Police Support Group until payment is effected .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , they shall be credited their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars ;  
Decides also that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , their share in the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars shall be set off against their outstanding obligations ;  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph ( b ) above , their respective share of an equivalent amount of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 ;  
Decides also that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be credited their respective share in the remaining portion of the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 after the application of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) as provided for in paragraph ( d ) above , that is , 760,075 dollars gross ( 532,675 dollars net ) ;  
While noting that the lack of financial resources due to the prevailing economic crisis in Solomon Islands leaves little scope to the State party for providing adequate educational services , the Committee nevertheless is concerned about the absence of compulsory primary education in Solomon Islands , with merely 60 per cent of school age children having access to primary education .  
Once a junior company has identified a commercial deposit and carried out initial development work , the deposit is usually sold to larger corporations with better financial and technical resources .  
Encouraging longer-term capital flows to a large number of developing countries to support development objectives with the ultimate goal of the eradication of absolute poverty , mainly through improved access to productive employment and basic services , and integrating the social dimensions of development into policy objectives in the new international financial architecture .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
It was stated that for national machineries to be effective , clear mandates , location at the highest possible level , accountability mechanisms , partnership with civil society , a transparent political process , adequate financial and human resources , and continued strong political commitment were crucial .  
Reaffirmation of the importance attached to the work of IAEA regarding multilateral technical cooperation in the development of the applications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and call again for every effort to be made to ensure that IAEA has the necessary financial and human resources to meet its responsibilities in the area of technical cooperation , safeguards and nuclear safety .

Reaffirmation of the importance attached to the work of IAEA regarding multilateral technical cooperation in the development of the applications of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and with due consideration of the needs of the developing areas of the world , call again for every effort to be made to ensure that IAEA has the necessary financial and human resources to meet its responsibilities in the area of technical cooperation , safeguards and nuclear safety .  
While recent steps taken by some international financial institutions , including the World Bank , have aimed at better integration of social concerns into the design of structural adjustment programmes , the International Monetary Fund has sometimes given inadequate attention to protecting public spending even for essential social services .  
Mr . Al-Kidwa ( Observer for Palestine ) said that , in the decades since its establishment , UNRWA had played a crucial and historical role in halting the further deterioration of the situation of Palestine refugees and had greatly assisted them by providing the necessary relief , health care , education and social services .  The severe financial difficulties faced by the Agency were of grave concern .  
It was imperative that the international community , especially the major donors , whether they were States or financial institutions , should not abandon the Palestinian people in such a difficult economic , political and social situation .  
An increased dialogue among the governing bodies is in response to the need for high-level discussions on policies at the national and global levels , development cooperation , and commitment to issues of common concern such as poverty , financial stability and economic and social sustainability .  
Firm-level technological development depends on external factors such as interaction with the local economic environment , which provides the human and financial resources needed for the cultivation of internal capability and essential services such as standard setting , testing , basic R &amp; amp ; D and other forms of institutional support that enable firms to conduct in-house technical work effectively . 
Lastly , the two parties expressed satisfaction that the negotiation and signature of important draft agreements on tourism , cooperation in combating illicit traffic and abuse of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances , and cooperation and mutual assistance in combating illegal financial operations had reached an advanced stage .  
Enhancing coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development and avoidance of international financial crisis and excessive financial volatility , and enhancing effective participation and integration of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the global economic system , including through capacity-building ;  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its decision 1996 / 114 , mindful of the need for and merit of having a consolidated set of the rules of procedure that are fully applicable to it , decided to entrust Mr . Ribot Hatano with the task of preparing , without financial implications , a working paper relating to the methods of work of the Sub _ Commission , to be submitted to it at its forty _ ninth session as a basis for discussion , which would contain :  
In the same resolution , the Commission on Human Rights requested the Secretary-General , the United Nations specialized agencies and the regional commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stressed that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions .  
Decides that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , they shall be credited their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars ;  
Decides also that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Group , their share in the unencumbered balance of 184,200 dollars gross ( 140,500 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 31 May 1997 and their respective share of the miscellaneous income of 68,983 dollars and interest income of 38,653 dollars shall be set off against their outstanding obligations ;  
Decides further that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be set off against the apportionment , as provided for in paragraph ( b ) above , their respective share of an equivalent amount of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) from the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 ;  
Decides also that , for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission , there shall be credited their respective share in the remaining portion of the unencumbered balance of 4,601,200 dollars gross ( 4,238,000 dollars net ) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 after the application of 3,841,125 dollars gross ( 3,705,325 dollars net ) as provided for in paragraph ( d ) above , that is , 760,075 dollars gross ( 532,675 dollars net ) ;  
Finally , some delegations pointed out that the main constraints to the effective and expanded application of TCDC / ECDC remain the lack of clearly defined national TCDC policies , insufficient awareness of TCDC 's full potential and importance , and inadequate provision of human and financial resources for TCDC .  
Among the attractions for offshore companies are the use of the United States dollar as the official currency , the absence of direct taxation , a growing financial infrastructure , fast and straightforward company registration procedures , extensive financial freedom and confidentiality .  
The CANZ delegations would have expected any questions surrounding such material amounts to have been settled and appropriate adjustments made to the financial statements before the accounts were submitted to Member States : the problem of unliquidated obligations was not new , had been the subject of critical comment by the Board of Auditors and the Advisory Committee in the past and had a direct impact on the funds due to Member States whether as troop contributors or as recipients of credits .  
Results confirm that despite continuing challenges , progress has been made by UNAIDS and its co-sponsors at the country level and that the theme groups on HIV / AIDS provide an effective way of coordinating financial and technical support to the national response to AIDS , encouraging teamwork and providing a forum for advocacy and interaction with bilateral agencies , non-governmental organizations and people living with HIV / AIDS .  
Affirming that , in paragraphs 13 and 14 of the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements5 it was recognized , inter alia , that the Habitat Agenda could only be effectively implemented if the role and functions of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) were strengthened and adequate financial resources , including new and additional resources from all sources , were mobilized at the national and international levels ,  
In addition , many delegations expressed support for the new strategic focus on security of tenure and urban governance and voiced the hope that the revitalization of the Centre would facilitate attainment of an adequate and predictable financial base .  
A focused , transparent and accountable Centre was also worthy of support and commitment from Member States , and he urged the Commission at its current session to send a positive financial signal in that regard , otherwise some very difficult decisions would have to be made .  
Finally , some delegations pointed out that the main constraints to the effective and expanded application of TCDC / ECDC remain the lack of clearly defined national TCDC policies , insufficient awareness of TCDC 's full potential and importance , and inadequate provision of human and financial resources for TCDC .  
Within its analytical activities regarding the main trends in world economy and the challenges and opportunities derived from them , ECLAC paid a great deal of attention to the repercussions of the international financial crisis .  A report on the impact of the Asian crisis on Latin America , which provided an extensive analysis of the medium and long-term impact of the crisis and policy - making recommendations , was presented to the Commission at its twenty-seventh session .  
The first took a new approach to the subject and included detailed analysis of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) corporate strategies of major investors , and paid special attention to regional investment abroad ; the second emphasized the positive effects that the global financial crisis has had on FDI in the region . 
A number of constraints militating against the successful implementation of the recommendations of the Conference were also identified , including economic and financial constraints ; technical and institutional limitations ; poorly coordinated actions among government departments , NGOs , civil society , the private sector and external partners ; and inadequate political will related to the use of available human and institutional capacity .  
The financial sector reforms , which included closure of institutions , more stringent capital adequacy requirements and larger provision for loan losses coupled with tight monetary policies , led to sharply higher interest rates and severely constrained access to credit . 
The impact came about through three main channels : ( a ) financial ( speculation against exchange rates , fall in the prices on regional stock markets and decline of capital inflows except at very high prices ) ; ( b ) trade ( deterioration of export prices , fall in the volume of exports and some problems of competition with Asian exporters ) ; and ( c ) policy measures by regional Governments to deal with problems resulting from the other two channels ( tight fiscal and monetary stance ) .  
The stabilization and adjustment measures implemented in many developing countries in different regions since the 1980s and more recently the financial crisis have drawn attention to the need to institute social safety net programmes in order to mitigate the short - and medium-term impact of the economic measures on the disadvantaged segment of the population .  
Requests the least developed countries bilateral , regional and multilateral development partners , in particular the European Union , the host of the Conference , and the United Nations Development Programme , to provide adequate technical and financial assistance to least developed countries to ensure a substantive and effective preparatory process for the Conference at the country level ;  
Integrate inland water transport within intermodal transport systems to provide door-to-door services for the movement of domestic and international traffic , thereby responding to market demand for convenient and competitive service while optimizing the economic , financial , environmental and social benefits that can be derived from each mode in the entire transport chain ;  
Accord appropriate priority to inland water transport in policy , planning and investment based on detailed analysis of the economic , financial , social and environmental benefits , and to promote public awareness of such benefits , thereby encouraging a modal shift to inland water transport , where appropriate ;  
Continue to undertake detailed analyses of the financial and economic crisis , paying particular attention to the role of financial markets , and to present options to members and associate members which they may use , as appropriate , as inputs in the formulation of their relevant national policies , with a view to ensuring the attraction of a steady inflow of private capital ;  
In the statement , the Ministers agreed that one of the key lessons for Africa of the current crisis is the need to strengthen supervisory and regulatory mechanisms to ensure transparency in financial transaction and improve corporate governance , in consonance with the principles of financial liberalization and the development of financial and capital markets .  
They welcomed the formation , at the initiative of the Group of Seven ( G-7 ) major industrialized countries , of an ad hoc intergovernmental working group to address issues relating to the proposed reform of the international financial and monetary system , and stressed the importance of adequate African representation in this group or any other group set up for a similar purpose .  
Having reviewed and shared experiences with tax reforms in their various countries , the Ministers agreed to reinforce macroeconomic stability and deepen financial market and institutional reforms , as well as to ensure sound interest and exchange-rate policy management so as to enhance private and public savings .  
They resolved to take the necessary steps to stem and reverse capital flight , focusing on policies that create and sustain a consistent and stable macroeconomic policy environment , and promoting capital and financial markets development , as well as resolving the problem of unsustainably high external debts .  
The discussion focused on six main subjects : measures to promote recovery and sustained economic growth ; financial architecture and financial flows for development ; increasing participation and cross-sectoral coherence ; international policy on external debt ; economic crisis and social policy initiatives ; and further cooperation between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions .  
In the view of several Ministers , efforts were necessary to stabilize State revenue by means of a fair system of taxation and efficient tax administration , and to mobilize more domestic capital through an effective private sector financial system subject to adequate bank supervision .  
Also , fundamental institutional safeguards were needed rules on competition , transparency , rule of law , democratic control of the State , core labour standards , a public spending structure that made adequate provision for the poor , in particular by means of social investments and a safety net to ensure that international or national financial resources had a positive impact on development .  
Several Ministers stated that , while developing countries were generally encouraged by recent broad proposals on functioning of international financial markets and financing for development , they were concerned about the design of the initiatives to give effect to such proposals .  
In connection with regulation 2 , some delegations were of the view that the biennial financial period should not start in 2002 , since budgetary requirements to be estimated in advance of a biennial period could only be based on stable and foreseeable expenditure patterns and the Meeting did not yet have sufficient information to foresee the developments in relation to the Tribunal 's expenditures .  
With regard to the retroactive implementation of the reformed procedures for determining reimbursement to Member States for contingent-owned equipment , while the issues which had been raised by the Board of Auditors deserved further scrutiny , the problems were mainly transitional and a comparative study on the financial implications would serve no useful purpose .  
The studies carried out in those areas have all contributed to a better understanding of the real conditions prevailing in the country and have led to the adoption of better focused development plans and strategies , which in turn have improved the management of physical , human and financial resources and have guaranteed their rational use , while also yielding a corresponding increase in productivity .  
The Group of Experts observed that in the context of the evolving international economic environment and globalization , it has become necessary to explore ways and means , particularly in the international taxation area , to provide an enabling environment for expansion of international trade and capital movements across national boundaries to promote financial resource mobilization for the achievement of sustainable economic growth .  
The agenda for the ninth meeting was based on the discussions during the eighth meeting of the Group of Experts and on important issues in international taxation in the context of prevailing international economic , fiscal and financial environment .  
The Group of Experts was aware that an efficient and effective revenue administration can help developing countries and transitional economies to mobilize additional revenue resources and achieve greater financial self-reliance in facilitating and achieving sustainable economic development .  
Banking and financial institutions , international technical assistance organizations and the specialized abilities of various United Nations agencies all have a role to play in ensuring that human , technical and material resources are wisely directed to sustained programmes of applied disaster mitigation practices .  
While there is expected to be a further narrowing of interest-rate spreads in 2000 , any major perturbation in financial markets of developed countries , such as marked corrections in stock markets or significant increases in interest rates , could adversely affect investor sentiment towards emerging markets .  
Progress in domestic economic reforms , though varying from country to country , and the improved international environment , notably less unfavourable commodity prices and more stable global financial markets , have been instrumental in improving the outlook .  
There are various reasons for this : the lagged growth cycle in many emerging market economies ; the former high levels of interest rates in some of these countries , especially in real terms ; the greater , though still limited , degree of independence gained for monetary policy in the many countries that have embraced floating exchange-rate regimes ; and the improved international and domestic financial conditions in many countries . 
The internationalization of the economy of the United States as well as of that of most countries as a result of improved communications , declining transport costs , trade liberalization , and global financial integration has stimulated a wide range of economic activities and changed the international division of labour in many industries . 
They also have to overcome such institutional constraints as less liquid and deep financial markets , less developed venture capital networks , less flexible corporate structures and a higher degree of government regulation in certain areas ( such as telecommunications ) . 
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating year 2000 issues in the areas of information management , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management , as well as legal , financial and administrative issues .  
The costs of establishing and maintaining an efficient transit transport system are often so high that landlocked and transit developing countries can not accomplish this formidable task without adequate support from the international donor community in the shape of advisory and technical services and financial resources .  
Although most international financial and economic organizations do not have specifically tailored programmes to address the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries as a category , most of these countries are eligible for soft window facilities as they are amongst the poorest .  
We welcome the progress made through the chairmanship of the European Commission and the World Bank towards establishing a donor coordination process to develop a coherent international assistance strategy for the region , opening the door for all donor opportunities , as well as to mobilize additional financial support for reconstruction , regional integration , economic recovery and reform and to promote sound macroeconomic and structural policies by the countries concerned .  
In order to examine one specific set of these downside risks , a study was undertaken , utilizing the models of Project LINK , of the possible impact on the world economy of another major financial crisis , on this occasion entailing a sizeable stock market correction and credit rationing , with currency realignments and shrinkage in international capital flows .  
In this era of heightened financial volatility , the importance of sound macroeconomic fundamentals has become paramount : a sustainable fiscal position and current-account balance , a low or moderate rate of inflation , and consistency between the rate of inflation and the exchange rate are indispensable for any economy , as all economies are open ( albeit to different degrees ) .  
It is now increasingly recognized that the response to crises has to address the domestic social consequences of any economic measures that are adopted and should not be restricted to restoring macroeconomic stability and international financial confidence .  
The main features of globalization have been an increasing reliance on a deregulated global market , maximally free trade , uncontrolled flow of investment , and the paramount role of the international financial market , with the IMF and the World Bank moving to the centre stage of world power .  
Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , with the assistance of the international community , especially donors , including through bilateral and / or multilateral financial support , should ensure that social safety nets are implemented , especially in those countries most affected by the recent global financial crisis , and ensure that they are adequately funded .  
Governments should improve the management and delivery of services for the growing urban agglomerations and put in place enabling legislative and administrative instruments and adequate financial resources to meet the needs of all citizens , especially the urban poor , internal migrants , older persons and the disabled .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems . 72 bis .  
Although we fully acknowledge the importance of reproductive health programmes , their implementation still requires enormous financial and technical assistance by the international community to complement the efforts made in this regard by developing countries , and the least developed in particular , since they can not meet these demands .  
Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , with the assistance of the international community , especially donors , including through bilateral and / or multilateral financial support , should ensure that social safety nets are implemented , especially in those countries most affected by the recent global financial crisis , and ensure that they are adequately funded .  
Governments should improve the management and delivery of services for the growing urban agglomerations and put in place enabling legislative and administrative instruments and adequate financial resources to meet the needs of all citizens , especially the urban poor , internal migrants , older persons and the disabled .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
Whatever the relevance of these measures , it is important to stress that positive results objectives such as improving the living conditions of our peoples and the elimination of poverty in developing countries in general and in African countries in particular can be achieved only if there is an increased mobilization of international financial resources and a substantial alleviation of the crushing debt burden on those countries .  
Since the developing countries constitute the majority of the world population , the successful implementation of the international Programme of Action is quite inconceivable if these serious economic and financial difficulties are not overcome and if the international environment , unfavourable for developing countries , is not rectified .  
This calls for new and additional resources from donor countries and international financial institutions to complement national efforts and resources for the further implementation of the noble principles of the ICPD Programme of Action and to reverse the current decline in overall official development assistance .  
First , political will for the advancement of the Cairo commitments in many developing countries has been weakened by the recent financial crisis and continued economic stagnation , as well as by frequently recurring natural disasters .  
Achieving the multiplicity of goals set at various conferences such as Agenda 21 , the Barbados Programme of Action for Small Island Developing States and the Cairo Programme of Action is not easy , but we can fully realize that objective if the international community , international financial institutions , the private sector , non-governmental organizations and national Governments together make a firm and collaborative commitment to such a worthy undertaking .  
Comparisons with other regulatory mechanisms for analogous markets ( such as the transport of toxic wastes and hazardous products , the regulation of securities and financial markets and institutions , the marking and tracing of weapons and other commercial goods , and treaty instruments containing provisions for judicial cooperation or extraterritorial jurisdiction ) should also be examined .  
The buyer was entitled to regard the bringing forward of the delivery date to late August merely as a reciprocal concession for a financial advantage and could not be expected to have understood that a few days delay in taking delivery would constitute a fundamental breach on its part .  
The sheer magnitude of the post-Cold War problems , the levels of national and regional insecurity they generate and State reluctance to continue to meet what are seen as the rising financial , political , environmental and social costs of maintaining large refugee populations , or receiving a continuous flow has had a marked and negative impact on the willingness of countries to provide asylum .  
In the interest of prudent financial management , up to half of the value of conditional pledges from governments and firm pledges made by organisations of established repute are recognised as income at the time the pledge is received .  
Liabilities for the payment of unused accrued annual leave ( maximum of 60 days ) and the payment of repatriation grants and related expenditures for relocation upon separation from the Organization based on the number of years of service , need to be valuated and the disclosure will be incorporated in the Notes to the Financial Statements for subsequent financial periods .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
It also assumes that international financial institutions and bilateral donors would demonstrate greater flexibility in the granting of loans to countries emerging from conflicts , where the entire administrative , economic and social infrastructures have very often been destroyed .  
Decides further that Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Transitional Administration and the Support Group shall be credited their respective share of the remaining unencumbered balance of 14,646,100 dollars gross ( 13,906,700 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1998 ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the Civilian Police Support Group until payment is effected .  
As an urgent priority , UNMIK will thoroughly assess the existing legal , financial , and fiscal structure and capacities in order to put in place policies for the recovery , development and future integration of Kosovo into a healthy and expanding regional economy in Southeastern Europe .  
Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session containing a comprehensive analysis of the organizational structure and technical , personnel and financial resources of the Non-Governmental Organizations Section , commensurate with the increased workload and the level of responsibility , necessary to implement the Secretariats mandate , as contained in Council resolution 1996 / 31 , parts 10 and 11 ;  
The Directors stressed that the successful implementation of the financial programme , including the clearance of external and domestic arrears , would hinge crucially on a sustained increase in budget revenue and the timely implementation of agreed measures .  
The work of UNRWA continued to be affected by the continuing financial crisis that the Agency has faced since 1993 as a result of repeated shortfalls in funding for the regular budget combined with increasing refugee needs .  
The Special Representative of the Secretary-General does not and can not enjoy the powers to decide at his own discretion the validity of Yugoslav laws in Kosovo and Metohija , because it is an integral part of the constitutional , legal , economic , financial , fiscal , monetary , foreign currency , customs , transport and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and those of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
In view of these circumstances , and seeking to gather more information on all aspects of the question of remote interpretation in the technical , financial and human resources fields , it has been provisionally decided to organize another experiment , as comprehensive as the one conducted earlier this year , but now entailing the servicing from Geneva of a two-week meeting to be held at Nairobi as early as possible in 2000 .  
The Commission had subsequently identified four areas for future analytical work and expert meetings : ( a ) the respective roles of government and the private sector and the interactions between them in SME development ; ( b ) inter-firm cooperation ; ( c ) SME clustering and networking ; and ( d ) the provision of sustainable financial and non-financial services for SME development .  
Governments should create an enabling environment for SMEs through stable macroeconomic policies and an open and flexible regulatory framework in order to stimulate free competition , research and development , and to create neutral conditions that fostered entrepreneurial activity , developed competitive advantages and created access to both national and foreign financial resources and new technologies .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
The Council reiterates the importance of a stable and predictable political and economic environment for local and foreign investment and other international financial flows , which remain essential for Africa 's economic and social development .  
The difficulties faced by SMEs in accessing financial services included the perceived high risks for lenders ; high transaction costs due to the absence of effective methodologies of risk assessment ; the lack of adequate information , such as accounting records and other financial documentation , from the SMEs themselves ; and lenders ' bias in favour of large corporate borrowers .  
By contributing to the Fund , States demonstrate their commitment to combating torture and their solidarity with the victims , enabling the latter to receive medical , psychological , psychiatric , financial , social , legal or humanitarian assistance and to resume a normal life . 
The programme that the independent expert is proposing in this paper would be based on international cooperation , in the form of a compact between the donor countries of the OECD , the financial institutions and the concerned developing countries , to realize three basic rights - the right to food , the right to primary health care and the right to primary education - within a specified time period .  
But the international community might like to decide to adopt a few specific international programmes to begin implementing the right to development as compacts between developed and developing countries which would take on the obligations of following policies and procedures mutually agreed upon and of providing required financial and other assistance as identified .  
Security Council resolution 1244 ( 1999 ) clearly defined the framework for the international civil and security presences in Kosovo and Metohija , which constitutes an integral part of the unified constitutional , legal , economic , financial , monetary , customs and tax systems of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Kosovo and Metohija is an autonomous province and constitutes an integral part of the single constitutional , legal , economic , financial , monetary , fiscal , foreign exchange , customs , traffic and other systems of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia .  
Some of the speakers saw an increase in public awareness about space activities and the benefits of exploring outer space as a major need and considered that such awareness would help garner the political and financial support for major national and international programmes .  
Wide-ranging applications being planned include distance learning , corporate training , collaborative work groups , telecommuting , telemedicine , electronic commerce , direct-to-home video and satellite news-gathering , as well as the distribution of music , software , scientific data and global financial and weather information .  
The experience of developing countries during the past several years has also demonstrated that financial crises are contagious ; that is , once difficulties emerge , markets do not adequately discriminate between countries with strong and weak fundamentals , or between those with strong and weak economic structures and macroeconomic management . 
Finally , recent experience has demonstrated a fundamental problem of the global economy , namely the enormous discrepancy that exists between an increasingly sophisticated and dynamic international financial world , with rapid globalization of financial portfolios , and the lack of a proper institutional framework to manage it .  
The rapid globalization of capital markets during the past two decades and the ability of a growing number of developing countries to tap those markets directly has been accompanied by the atrophy of official development assistance ( ODA ) and a significant slowing in the pace of lending by the multilateral financial institutions . 
International financial flows for development occur through borrowing abroad under commercial terms , through official development assistance , and through the regular lending activities of multilateral lending institutions , which borrow funds in international capital markets and lend the proceeds to developing countries . 
The rapid liberalization of financial transactions in developing countries without sufficient prudential regulation was an important element in the onset of the current financial and economic crisis .  
These regimes seek to strike an acceptable balance between the need for intellectual property owners to secure an appropriate rate of financial return on their investment in knowledge , and the larger social benefits that would flow from rapid and unrestricted knowledge flows .  
While the Committee is aware of the efforts undertaken by the State party to allocate substantial financial resources for the benefit of children , it reiterates its concern ( see CRC / C / 15 / Add . 24 , para . 8 ) that stringent budgetary measures and external debt , as well as the persistence of widespread poverty and uneven income distribution , are still having a negative impact on the situation of children in the State party .  
While the Committee is aware that the full implementation of the new juvenile justice system requires substantial financial and human resources as well as the development of infrastructure , as established in the document entitled Transformation and investment in the human rights of children and adolescents ( May 1999 ) , it remains concerned that the juvenile justice system is not fully implemented .  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
The Secretariat should note in particular the clear and unambiguous language of paragraphs 3 and 9 of the draft resolution , which emphasized that all future and existing peacekeeping missions should be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements and that no peacekeeping mission should be financed by borrowing funds from other active peacekeeping missions .  
The increased political and financial support to UPE is a promising sign of greater international and domestic attention to creating a basis for effective recognition of the right to education .  
While the previous decades left a negative heritage , as is summarized below , the political and financial commitment to investment in education that led to UPE in 1997 promises to remedy the inherited dissociation between political and economic governance and open the way towards defining the right to education within Ugandas specific international and domestic environment .  
[ Globalization and in particular financial liberalization , the extent of resources controlled by the private sector and corporate strategies for investment have at the same time far / Globalization greatly increased trade and capital flows , opens new opportunities for sustained economic growth and development of the world economy and also permits countries to share experiences and to learn from one anothers achievements and difficulties .  
Promoting South-South cooperation , particularly in terms of economic and technical cooperation , and supporting a triangular mechanism whereby donor countries would provide [ financial / appropriate United States ] support for South-South cooperation ; considering the establishment of a generalized trust fund [ supported by voluntary contributions United States ] for triangular economic technical cooperation among developing countries .  
The eventual abandonment of this regime in favour of an independent Palestinian currency would be a natural conclusion of the transitional process , during which credibility is established , institutions are built up and financial markets mature .  
Effective integration into international capital markets requires a deepening of domestic capital markets by increasing domestic savings and developing a strong domestic institutional investor base on the one hand , and by strengthening the prudential supervision of financial markets , together with sound and efficient banking systems , on the other .  
Resulting exchange rate appreciation and abrupt compensatory movements in fiscal and monetary policies that accentuate the cyclical movements of foreign capital can entail high development costs , especially if domestic financial systems are weak and not well regulated and supervised .  
The BSEC Charters preamble reaffirms the common will of its member States to adhere to the principles of the United Nations Charter and share the vision of their regional cooperation as part of the integration process in Europe , based on human rights and fundamental freedoms , prosperity through economic liberty , social justice , and equal security and stability , which is open for interaction with other countries , regional initiatives and international organizations and financial institutions .  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating Y2K issues in the areas of information technology , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management and legal , financial and administrative issues . 
It has also contributed actively to a number of international and regional funds established to promote economic and social development in various countries of the world , including the Kuwait-based Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development , the Islamic Development Bank and other financial and economic institutions established for that purpose , and which the State of Kuwait is diligently supporting so that they can achieve the noble , humanitarian aims for which they were established . 
There is also concern that the recent emphasis in financial and economic policies has not always been development-oriented , that the dominance of a limited set of macroeconomic targets and parameters over the social , political , cultural and environmental domains has gone too far , and that social and economic policies and objectives must be fully integrated .  
Finally , the Council agreed that the international community has a key role to play in supporting efforts to eradicate poverty , promote productive employment and achieve gender equality , and that the mobilization of new and additional financial resources from all sources , national and international , is required .  
Call on the international community to provide effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , in accordance with chapter 33 of Agenda 21 , to support small island developing States [ , in particular the least developed amongst them ] in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ;  
The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels , including the international level , to strengthen support , including financial support from all sources , to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity-building and institutional building , facilitating the access of small island developing States to and transfer and use of environmentally sound technology , as set forth in the Programme of Action .  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
Building on the recent small island developing States donors meeting , with special consideration from the international community for new and additional financial commitments and disbursements of resources , as well as better and more efficient use of ODA and other existing external sources of finance , taking into account the specific development needs and priorities of small island developing States ;  
The second module , which is under development , will assess specific skills and abilities within occupational groups keyed to functional requirements ( administrative , financial , logistical , electoral etc . ) .  
This implies the full respect of the unified legal , economic , financial ( the dinar as the sole legal tender ) , tax , visa and passport systems and observance of the laws of the Republic of Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that are in force , in particular those relating to property , legal and status and administrative matters , registry of citizens and issuance of personal identification documents , passports and other identity papers .  
The Commission had subsequently identified four areas for future analytical work and expert meetings : ( a ) the respective roles of government and the private sector and the interactions between them in SME development ; ( b ) inter-firm cooperation ; ( c ) SME clustering and networking ; and ( d ) the provision of sustainable financial and non-financial services for SME development .  
Governments should create an enabling environment for SMEs through stable macroeconomic policies and an open and flexible regulatory framework in order to stimulate free competition , research and development , and to create neutral conditions that fostered entrepreneurial activity , developed competitive advantages and created access to both national and foreign financial resources and new technologies .  
" 17 .  UNCTAD , in cooperation with other relevant international organizations and within existing human and financial resources , should seek to assist developing countries , upon request , in understanding the implications of various legislative approaches to accommodating electronic commerce ; "  
The United States , which has continued to apply laws and measures affecting the sovereignty and legitimate interests of other States and freedom of trade and navigation , as well as inflicting tremendous pain on the Cuban people , should , in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and relevant resolutions of the United Nations , put an end to the economic , commercial and financial embargo that it has imposed on Cuba .  
The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that while the international community is directing its efforts towards resolving tensions and the further promotion and expansion of commercial relations at global level , the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba has caused the Cuban people serious suffering and also created difficulties in global commercial and financial relations .  
That the United States of America continues to ignore the will of the international community , as embodied in the successive resolutions adopted by the General Assembly with a view to lifting the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba , is to be regarded as a flagrant violation of the principles and norms of international law and of the Charter of the United Nations .  
The policies and laws of economic , commercial and financial blockade and embargo of the United States of America imposed on the Republic of Cuba in the last decades violate the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law , and run counter to the common trends of our world today , namely cooperation for development on the basis of equality amongst sovereign States and non-discrimination of political systems .  
Similarly , the creation and establishment of a balanced human rights programme and the need to allocate adequate human and financial resources to capacity building , the right to development , economic , social and cultural rights , technical cooperation etc . , are also missing from the report .  Alternative recommendation 2 : To include the establishment of a balanced human rights programme on the agenda of the working group referred to above .  
Uncertainty about future developments in the international economy has grown in the aftermath of the global financial crisis , which demonstrated the volatility of international private capital flows and its damaging effects on levels of economic activity and peoples livelihoods in developing countries .  
Such legislative , regulatory or administrative measures could include the use of authenticated end-user certificates , enhanced legal and enforcement measures , as appropriate , to control arms-brokering activities , requirements to ensure that no retransfer of small arms and light weapons takes place without prior authorization of the original supplier State , and cooperation in the exchange of information on suspect financial activities .  
Among the recent measures reported by Governments to underline the priority assigned to improving the financial situation of families are : expanding a cash support system for families with young children ( Norway ) ; initiating a national social security savings scheme ( Singapore ) ; initiating a Family Support Trust Fund ( Cyprus ) ; initiating child relief and tax rebates for the first to fourth child ( Singapore ) ; and providing welfare benefits for the elderly ( Thailand ) .  
The five basic commonly cited obstacles the global economic situation ; limited financial resources ; the lack of trained personnel ; insufficient inter-institutional coordination ; and the paucity of basic data and comparative research may be described as follows :  
Any decision on the venue of the international conference on the illicit arms trade must take into account the need to ensure the most advantageous financial conditions for the participants in the conference ; a broad geographical spectrum of participating countries ; maximum effectiveness of the work of the conference ; and the necessary security guarantees for delegations .  
Moreover , the joint UNDP / UNCTAD Programme on Globalization , Liberalization and Sustainable Human Development , which was initiated in 1998 , supports the development of a conceptual and analytical framework articulating globalization and sustainable human development and the strengthening of the negotiation capacities of poor countries , to enable them to participate better in the negotiations of multilateral trade , investment and financial agreements .  
The meeting requested least developed countries development partners , both bilateral and multilateral , to provide adequate financial and technical resource to the Conference secretariat to ensure an efficient and effective preparatory process .  
The ninth G15 summit , held in Montego Bay , Jamaica , in February 1999 , had emphasized the need to find appropriate solutions to the financial crisis , which had had widespread negative economic and social consequences and had increased unemployment and poverty .  
In addition , the office would manage any new United Nations civilian mission , facilitate continuing dialogue among key actors in Haiti and the international community , support the democratization process , help to mobilize international political and financial support for Haiti and provide the political framework and focal point for integrating and coordinating the activities of the international community .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance to landlocked developing countries be extended on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and substantially increased .  
Her delegation was disappointed that the " Issues for consideration " document provided few pragmatic and concrete recommendations on the role that international cooperation could play in building up physical infrastructure in the transport sector , and no concrete suggestion had been put forward on how to strengthen and improve international cooperation , particularly in improving financial resource availability for transport infrastructure development .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
Yet , as world trade , investment and financial flows continue to expand at a remarkable pace , so has the need for establishing integrated , flexible , fast , cost-effective and environmentally sound national and international transport and communications become more pronounced .  
The Advisory Committee notes from paragraph 3 of the report ( DP / 1999 / 40 ) and the interim financial statements for the year ended 31 December 1998 that UNOPS brought the level of its operational reserve from $ 17.6-million at 31 December 1997 to $ 19.9-million at 31 December 1998 , which is the approved level of 4 per cent of the combined expenditure on administrative and project budgets of the prior year ( $ 499.7-million ) in accordance with Executive Board decision 97 / 21 of 18 September 1997 .  
Among the substantive issues discussed , the following warrant special note : identification of the items to be considered ; how to ensure observance of existing international standards ; activities to be undertaken ; appraisal of progress achieved and obstacles met in eliminating racism ; measures for making United Nations mechanisms more effective ; and , lastly , proposals for securing the necessary human and financial resources .

The future of the University is strongly tied to the political and financial support reflected not only in greater numbers of Governments acceding to the International Agreement for the Establishment of the University for Peace but also in increasing contributions of financial resources for the normal functioning of the University and the launching of new programmes .  
According to the conclusions contained in the report , regional and international financial , technical and technological assistance in rebuilding infrastructure and administrative capacity and civil society , and in economic rehabilitation for the implementation of practical disarmament measures , should include the early involvement of international financial institutions .  
A policy framework that integrates macroeconomic , financial , structural , social and human issues is imperative if there is to be equitable and sustainable development .  
In designing and implementing the policy and programme options for improving the conditions of the poor in an increasingly global context , three factors are essential for success : good governance ; an efficient administrative and institutional support structure at both the national and local levels for the effective delivery and monitoring of social development programmes ; and adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors .  
The discussion focused on six main issues : measures to promote recovery and sustained economic growth ; financial architecture and financial flows for development ; increasing participation and cross-sectoral coherence ; international policy on external debt ; economic crisis and social policy initiative and further cooperation between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions .  
IMF policy advice , financial and technical assistance has sought to improve the quality of public expenditure by shifting resources away from unproductive outlays , such as excessive military expenditure , to infrastructure , basic education and health care , which build physical and human capital and thus enhance broad-based growth and equity , and to target poverty alleviation programmes .  
While mercenaries may be recruited , trained and financed from within solid , stable countries , they are in fact used chiefly in countries affected by political violence , internal armed conflict , insurrection or insurgency and lacking the necessary financial or technical capacity to exploit their natural resources on an industrial scale .  
Further , additional financial resources will be decentralized to country offices to provide greater flexibility in providing short advisory services to member States and to facilitate regular public and private sector policy dialogue .  
Member States are encouraged to continue supporting the efforts of the Office in this area and to provide additional financial resources as part of their contributions to the programme of advisory services and technical assistance in the field of human rights , to enable the Office to further extend its activities in support of Member States that request assistance in establishing national institutions and also to support such institutions in their work .  
We have heard a comprehensive report on the evolution of the United Nations role in decolonization ; we have received prescriptions for addressing this critical issue for our small island Territories in a new millennium ; and we have listened intently to the extensive dialogue on the impact of unilateral changes on the offshore financial sector of the Territories . 
It also requested all non-governmental organizations dealing with womens issues to devote some of their activities to the study of the various harmful traditional practices and ways of eradicating them and appealed to the international community to provide material , technical and financial support to non-governmental organizations and groups working to achieve the total elimination of such practices .  
Decides further that any exceptions to this rule may be made by the body concerned only if the statements are to serve as bases for discussion and if , after hearing a statement of the relevant financial implications , the body decides that one or more statements in extenso may be included in the summary record , or reproduced as separate documents or as annexes to authorized documents .  
Within its current severe financial and staffing constraints , the Institute has been able to implement a modest but promising substantive programme of work , thus demonstrating its institutional potential and proving its capability to fulfil its unique role in pursuit of the advancement of women and gender equality .  
Links are being forged or strengthened with international , regional and sub-regional organizations ; academic and other institutions ; international financial institutions ; the private sector ; members of civil society ; and even military organizations and police structures .  
Since landlocked developing countries were among the poorest countries in their particular geographical regions , and in addition to being landlocked most of them suffered from all the extreme handicaps of the least developed countries , it was therefore important that financial assistance be extended to them on the most concessional terms possible and that the flow of financial and technical assistance be prioritized and increased substantially .  
Her delegation was disappointed that the document on issues for consideration provided few pragmatic and concrete recommendations on the role that international cooperation could play in building up physical infrastructure in the transport sector , and no concrete suggestion had been put forward on how to strengthen and improve international cooperation , particularly in improving financial resource availability for transport infrastructure development .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
Yet , as world trade , investment and financial flows continue to expand at a remarkable pace , so has the need for establishing integrated , flexible , fast , cost-effective and environmentally sound national and international transport , and communications become more pronounced .  
Decides further that any exceptions to this rule may be made by the body concerned only if the statements are to serve as bases for discussion and if , after hearing a statement of the relevant financial implications , the body decides that one or more statements in extenso may be included in the summary record , or reproduced as separate documents or as annexes to authorized documents .  
Policies for the prevention and the better management of financial crises have so far concentrated on particular areas , such as improved transparency , strengthened financial regulation , financial facilities better designed to support countries experiencing large capital outflows and currency collapses , and reduction of moral hazard problems in international lending and investment .  
It provides such channels as absence of currency controls at borders ; increased and instant capital flows at the international level , making it difficult to isolate suspicious transactions ; dollarization of economies , thereby facilitating the circulation of dirty cash ; and a multiplication of the development of offshore financial services to attract foreign investments .  
Combined efforts of the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , should help countries to enhance the performance of macroeconomic management , achieve greater coherence in the policies affecting economic , financial , social and environmental aspects , and protect the most vulnerable groups , and thus give the concerned country an opportunity to use this support to further its national goals while integrating better into the global economy .  
The first is the pledge of $ 220-million for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance for Kosovo and neighbouring countries ; and the second is a pledge announced yesterday in Tokyo for a preliminary $ 2-million to meet immediate humanitarian needs for East Timor , to be followed by further assistance in response to any future appeal , as well as substantial financial contributions to the United Nations trust fund to support the multinational force established by the Security Council resolution . 
As 17 of the landlocked developing countries are also classified by the United Nations as least developed countries and most transit countries are themselves developing countries facing serious economic problems , including the lack of adequate infrastructure in the transport sector , donor countries and the financial and development institutions play a critical role in providing the financial and technical assistance required to improve transit systems .  
The costs of establishing and maintaining an efficient transit transport system are often so high that landlocked and transit developing countries can not accomplish this formidable task without support from the international donor community in the shape of advisory and technical services and financial resources .  
Although most international financial and economic organizations do not have specifically tailored programmes to address the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries as a category , most of these countries are eligible for soft window facilities as they are amongst the poorest countries .  
The awarding authority must , in each case , satisfy itself that the contract proposed has been examined and approved by the legal , financial and other officers as appropriate , that adequate tenders be requested , that , all other conditions being equal , the lowest price or bid be accepted and that the contract proposed is overall in accordance with the Agencys best interests .  
In its resolution 53 / 172 , the United Nations General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to submit a report on current trends in global financial flows and modalities to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with financial crises , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups .  
Pursuant to this resolution , and with a view to contributing to the report which Secretary-General Kofi Annan is to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session , the High-Level Regional Meeting Towards a stable and predictable international financial system and its relationship to social development was held in Mexico City from 5 to 7 September 1999 at the initiative of the Mexican Government and with the support of ECLAC .  
One important and urgent challenge for the United Nations is that of including , as part of its activities in the economic , social and financial fields , the in-depth consideration of issues such as financial crisis prevention and management , issues pertaining to financing for development , the rules of access to multilateral resources and the role of regional institutions , while respecting the areas in which national autonomy must be preserved .  
Regarding the groups proposals on practical measures of assistance to third countries affected by sanctions , Belarus feels that the priority step might be to dispatch to the worst-affected third countries special representatives of the Secretary-General accompanied by special missions to elaborate recommendations for alleviating the economic , commercial , financial , social , humanitarian and environmental effects .  
However , some preliminary results seem to show that aid alone can play only a limited role with respect to the three categories of possible effects of sanctions on third States , i.e . economic , trade and financial effects ; social and humanitarian effects ; and secondary effects as indicated in the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting . 
Military service has been estimated to be more straining both physically and psychologically , the actual daily / weekly time of duty is longer , there are fewer financial benefits and freedom of movement and other aspects of personal freedom are more restricted .  
Decisions to recommend projects for support are considered by interdisciplinary review entities , at substantive , administrative and financial levels , and are based on the technical quality of the proposal , its relationship to national policies and the contribution that project results are expected to make to the further equalization of opportunities by , for and with persons with disabilities .  
Even though the primary responsibility of maintaining security and the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and areas always lies with the host State , the international community is duty bound to assist governments in this task and , above all , to bear the bulk of the costs to African States whose financial and logistic capacities are limited .  
Not only are the financial and material resources devoted by the international community and the international financial institutions to combat the real causes of conflicts in Africa completely inadequate , but there is also insufficient emergency financial aid being devoted to the needs of the African continent .  
The main functions of the Division will be to plan and monitor the economic and social reconstruction of East Timor , in close consultation with the East Timorese ; to prepare and evaluate policies and to set up institutions in the economic , social and financial fields ; and to coordinate with the various donors and international financial institutions the resource mobilization efforts of UNTAET .  
The major shortcomings of the initiative are derived from the complexity of the process itself , as well as the lack of adequate funding for an expeditious resolution of all eligible cases without damage to the financial standing of the public institutions to which the debt is owed .  
A favourable and enabling investment climate which mobilizes FDI and domestic savings and channels them into productive investments also requires that the suppliers of capital have reliable , transparent and comparable financial information .  
C In cooperation with other international and regional institutions , undertake technical assistance programmes on capital market development and other specific actions to strengthen the domestic financial infrastructure , with a view to assisting developing countries to mobilize stable sources of finance ;  
C Identifying policies to address major constraints faced by many developing countries in responding to environmental challenges , such as lack of technical , financial , institutional and supply capacities , taking into account the environmental and developmental conditions of each country ;  
Policy-oriented analytical work should be carried out by UNCTAD on : ( 1 ) the impact of electronic commerce on trade policies ; ( 2 ) the fiscal and financial implications of electronic commerce ; ( 3 ) the implications for developing countries of the legal and regulatory aspects of electronic commerce ; and ( 4 ) the impact of electronic commerce on employment , productivity and economic growth .  
UNDCP is playing a catalytic role in providing the strategy for achieving this goal , in close cooperation with national and international partners and international financial institutions engaged in poverty eradication , health and education to improve the overall quality of life in areas affected by illicit cultivation of narcotic crops , thereby reducing incentives for the cultivation of illicit crops .  
Finally , UNDCP was requested to provide requesting Governments with the technical assistance that they required and to take steps to mobilize international logistical and financial support with a view to establishing national mechanisms for monitoring and verifying the cultivation of illicit crops used in the production of drugs and developing an international network for the control of illicit cultivation for the purpose of implementing the Action Plan .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 , 50 / 10 , 51 / 17 , 52 / 10 and 53 / 4 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
Notes the importance of joint efforts to overcome the constraints in implementing the Programme of Action , by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , deeper involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , and availability of financial resources ;  
While its close-knit families and strong agricultural base had enabled Thailand to weather the 1997 financial crisis , the existing social safety nets had been severely tested and the crisis had served as a reminder that social development could not be treated as secondary to economic development .  
Since ideology and determination alone could not secure social development in developing countries , there must be an effort during the special session to strengthen international partnerships with a view to mobilizing the necessary financial assistance , technical know-how and human resources .  
The main features of the Governments policy concerning persons with disabilities were to safeguard equal rights and provide equal opportunities ; promote full and equal participation by disabled persons in the social and economic life of the country , deinstitutionalize disabled persons and promote independent living ; and provide financial assistance to organizations of the disabled .  
Services were provided in medical rehabilitation ; education ; training and retraining ; vocational assessment and guidance ; placement in employment in the open market , sheltered employment , self-employment and supported employment ; provision of technical aids ; removal of social and physical barriers ; provision of allowances ; and financial assistance to disabled persons for purchasing their own homes .  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Although the current scale of assessments had been blamed by some for the Organizations financial difficulties , that scale had been based on extensive negotiations among all Member States and had proved to be fair and reasonable in practice , since it basically reflected the Members capacity to pay .  
If a substantial portion of the outstanding contributions was paid , the level of the Organizations reserves could be restored , the Peacekeeping Reserve Fund fully capitalized , amounts owed to troop-contributing countries fully paid , and the budgetary surpluses retained from earlier financial periods returned to Member States , or , preferably , used to strengthen permanently the level of the Organizations reserves , giving the United Nations the assured funding base it required .  
Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes , in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
The enormous financial gains from illicit transactions , the abundant availability of small arms and the most sophisticated weaponry alike , as well as easy access to technology all help to create an ever more dangerous type of terrorist .  
Calls upon all Governments , and all relevant United Nations organizations , and multilateral and regional financial institutions to increase allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to identify new funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Appeals to the international community and to relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system to continue providing financial , technical and material assistance to the Community in order to enable it to further advance the process of regional economic integration ;  
Thirdly , financial and exchange rate instability were closely related and in fact fueled one another , with the result that an integrated treatment of trade and finance was essential for designing consistent national and global policies .  
It is of considerable regret to us that some of the soldiers serving in Sierra Leone on behalf of the international community , the non-UNAMSIL ECOMOG contingents , will not be funded on this basis and will instead continue to rely on voluntary contributions , which have been desperately slow in coming and which are , at least on the basis of past practice , unlikely to relieve significantly the financial burden ECOMOG troop-contributors have assumed .  
Moreover , these strategies and policies should be formulated with a view to greater coherence between the structural , macroeconomic , trade , financial and development aspects of economic policy so as to increase the effectiveness of these policies , and help secure an open and stable economic policy framework conducive to developing countries integration into world trade , their economic and social development and poverty reduction .  
Globalisation through free trade and open investment regimes can improve the overall performance of developing countries economies provided domestic policies are enhanced by strengthening competition on domestic markets , by opening up new market opportunities abroad for developing countries exports and by increasing the financial resources available for investment in physical capital and intangible assets , including indispensable public goods . 
Stability and efficiency of the national as well as regional financial markets , increased domestic savings and optimal allocation of resources are a sound basis for sustainable economic growth .  
Whereas some emerging economies have taken full advantage of the possibility of attracting foreign capital , most LDCs were unable to do so due to a lack of adequate macro-economic policies and to the structural weakness of their institutional and legal framework , and in particular of their financial sector , as well as to the risks resulting from the volatility of financial markets .  Capital flow liberalisation must continue .  
the promotion of effective prudential supervision as well as the promotion of norms on capital flow transparency so as to consolidate domestic financial sectors in developing countries and to prevent global systemic crises ;  
Urgent measures were required , therefore , to remedy that situation through , inter alia , the provision of the technical , human and financial resources commensurate with the tasks and responsibilities of the Office of the Special Coordinator , which , even with extremely limited human and financial resources , had accomplished many commendable tasks . 
The Asian financial crisis has accelerated initiatives to improve the timeliness and quality of information concerning key macroeconomic variables as well as the financial reporting of banks and non-financial firms . 8 These are viewed as essential for better decision-taking by private lenders and investors , greater market discipline over policy makers , more effective policy surveillance by multilateral financial institutions , and strengthened financial regulation and supervision . 
Regarding key macroeconomic variables , an initiative had already been taken after the Mexican crisis when IMF established the Special Data Dissemination Standard ( SDDS ) in April 1996 to guide member countries in the public dissemination of economic and financial information in the context of seeking or maintaining access to international financial markets .  
In April 1998 , the Interim Committee proposed a broadening of SDDS , so that the system would also cover additional financial data such as net reserves ( after allowance for central banks liabilities under forward or derivative transactions ) , the debt ( in particular the short-term debt ) of economic agents and other indicators bearing on the stability of the financial sector .  
However reasonable the original managerial decision to make a loan or acquire an asset , and however justified its initial classification as low-risk by banking supervisors , the loan is vulnerable to a possible eventual deterioration in its status . 17 So long as cycles of financial boom and bust are features of the economic system , so also will be unforeseeable deteriorations in the status of many bank assets . 
The failure of IMF surveillance in preventing international financial crises reflects , in part , belated , and so far only partial , adaptation of existing procedures to the problems posed by the large autonomous private capital flows ; but perhaps more fundamentally that failure is due to the unbalanced nature of these procedures , which give too little recognition to the disproportionately large global impact of monetary policies in a small minority of OECD countries .  
Recognizing that mutually supportive efforts at the national and international levels are imperative in the pursuit of sustainable development , which includes , inter alia , the provision of financial resources and the transfer of technology for the application of cost-effective energy systems and wider use of environmentally friendly , renewable energies ,  
In order to carry out those difficult but necessary changes , Africa needed the international communitys support , including increased financial and humanitarian assistance , contributions to peacekeeping efforts , reduction of the debt burden , better access to export markets and incentives for foreign direct investment .  
While globalization and market liberalization had had a positive impact on some countries , the aspirations of many of the worlds peoples , especially those of the least developed nations , remained unattainable because of their worsening economic and financial problems and their burden of foreign debt .  The continued decline of commodity prices , along with protectionism on the part of the developed countries , had wrought severe hardship on the developing countries .  
Requests the Secretary-General , the specialized agencies and the regional economic commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stresses that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions ;  
Noting that the territorial Government continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territory 's deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
Tunisia supported the idea of establishing a multilateral mechanism to control foreign capital and speculative flows in order to stabilize and regulate the international financial and monetary situation so as to respond better to the development requirements of the countries of the South and promote their progressive integration into the world economy .  
With consistently negative economic growth and development indicators , the African countries needed an international economic and financial climate that promoted fair trade ; increased market access for African products ; stimulated net capital inflows and , above all , gave globalization a human face .  
Those overall trends masked the serious debt problems faced by the heavily indebted poor countries and the fact that a growing number of middle-income developing countries had experienced serious payments problems , aggravated by the contagion effects of the Asian financial crisis ( A / 54 / 370 , paras . 3 to 5 ) .  
Many developing-country speakers stressed that the vulnerability of developing countries to external shocks , particularly to swings in commodity prices , volatility in international capital flows , and financial contagion , had increased as a result of greater global integration .  
Calls for effective governance of globalization through democratization of international economic policy decision-making ; integrated consideration of trade , finance , technology transfer and developmental issues by the relevant international institutions ; and reform of the international financial architecture and , in this context , calls for close cooperation and coordination between the United Nations , the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization ;  
Calls upon the developed countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of the development of developing countries ;  
It agreed on the need for good governance , an efficient administrative and institutional support structure , adequate human and financial resource capacity and active partnership among all development actors ( A / 54 / 316 , para .  44 ) .  
Economic growth was strongly correlated with poverty alleviation , and thus the most useful approach lay in the creation of a sound macroeconomic foundation for sustainable growth , with open markets , transparent regulatory systems , strong financial oversight and participatory decision-making .  
Greater access to the markets of industrialized countries , international financial stability and technological cooperation on an equitable and sustainable basis were indispensable to improving the conditions of developing countries in the era of globalization .  
Conditions which might assist developing countries in addressing poverty issues at the macroeconomic , institutional and policy levels were , respectively , globalization ; the awareness-building role of civil society and the role of the private sector , particularly in creating jobs and spurring rapid economic growth ; and the achievement of a balance between the economic and financial aspects of development and social , cultural and institutional concerns .  
Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
Invites United Nations financial and developmental institutions , operational programmes and the specialized agencies , as well as other regional and international organizations , in accordance with the existing procedures of their governing bodies :  
The Year 2000 Management Group is supported by a year 2000 team , an interdepartmental task force coordinating year 2000 issues in the areas of information technology , peacekeeping operations , humanitarian affairs , economic and social affairs , development cooperation , security and safety , facility management and legal , financial and administrative issues . 
Mr . Aleman ( Ecuador ) stressed the need for concerted action to solve the international financial crisis , and welcomed the Cologne debt initiative of the major industrialized countries as a sign of solidarity with countries like Ecuador , which had struggled with the impact of structural adjustment over the past several years .  
As national governments had the primary responsibility for setting macroeconomic , structural and social policies that would generate growth and contribute to poverty reduction , such comprehensive strategies should be country-driven and elaborated in close cooperation with the international financial institutions . 
Serious efforts should also be directed towards securing adequate market access for developing countries products , access to technology , stable exchange rates , reasonably low levels of interest rates and predictable and assured financial flows .  
A broad range of non-physical obstacles such as poor utilization of assets , weak and inefficient transport management , cumbersome and incompatible procedures , outmoded financial , regulatory and institutional systems , trade imbalances and inadequate security , often accompanied by very high user charges ;  
Yet , as world trade , investment and financial flows continue to expand at a remarkable pace , so has the need for establishing integrated , flexible , fast , cost-effective and environmentally sound national and international transport and communications become more pronounced .  
The costs of establishing and maintaining an efficient transit transport system are often so high that landlocked and transit developing countries can not accomplish this formidable task without support from the international donor community in the shape of advisory and technical services and financial resources .  
Although most international financial and economic organizations do not have specifically tailored programmes to address the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries as a category , most of these countries are eligible for soft window facilities as they are amongst the poorest countries .  
Requests the Secretary-General , the specialized agencies and the regional economic commissions to provide financial and technical assistance for the organization of the regional preparatory meetings planned in the context of the World Conference and stresses that such assistance should be supplemented by voluntary contributions ;  
In order to achieve respect for cultural differences within a context of national unity , national reconciliation and democratic coexistence , it is essential to implement a comprehensive , nationwide programme of civic education , for which the necessary human and financial resources must be provided .  
Invites United Nations financial and developmental institutions , operational programmes and the specialized agencies , as well as other regional and international organizations , in accordance with the existing procedures of their governing bodies :  
In conclusion , he stressed the importance of enhanced technological cooperation and financial assistance from industrialized countries in order to build the capacity of developing countries to meet environmental challenges .  
Measures requiring financial institutions and other professions involved in financial transactions to utilize the most efficient measures available for the identification of their usual or occasional customers , as well as customers in whose interest accounts are opened , and to pay special attention to unusual or suspicious transactions and report transactions suspected of stemming from a criminal activity . 
Adopting regulations imposing on financial institutions the obligation to report promptly to the competent authorities all complex , unusual large transactions and unusual patterns of transactions , which have no apparent economic or obviously lawful purpose , without fear of assuming criminal or civil liability for breach of any restriction on disclosure of information if they report their suspicions in good faith ;  
The growing openness of some economies made them more vulnerable to adverse external effects and promoted the spread of local economic troubles to other regions of the world , as the recent financial crisis in Asia had demonstrated .  
International financial markets and rapid capital movement drained financial resources from newly emerging economies through currency speculation , and huge transfers of resources from the developing to the developed economies continued unchecked .  
The developing countries , for their part , were dependent on limited overseas markets and exports and were at the mercy of the international financial institutions ; they suffered the negative consequences of globalization but had virtually no role in defining the rules of the game , and their repeated calls for democratic governance of the global economy had fallen on deaf ears .  
However , the internal conflict had considerably diminished the pool of financial and human resources required for economic growth , and the underground economy spawned by drug trafficking had caused huge distortions , not only of economic data but also of social indicators .  
Capital movements had played a large part in the recent financial crises , and developing countries must honestly evaluate whether their economic policies were adequate to face the challenges of the abrupt demographic , economic and technological changes resulting from globalization .  
While no effort should be spared to maintain that generally beneficial tendency towards a free market economy and liberalization , there was obviously an urgent need for much better regulation and supervision of the international financial system , based on common sets of norms and standards .  
In order to cope with global challenges , there was a need for a range of measures , such as international cooperation and partnership to reform the international financial architecture , including early warning systems and the introduction of responsible domestic policies , good corporate governance and efficient and transparent financial sectors . 
Besides sound macroeconomic fundamentals , a strong domestic financial and banking system with adequate supervisory and regulatory mechanisms , transparency and good governance were extremely important in order to guard against vulnerability to shifts in market sentiment and to contagion effects from policy weaknesses in other countries . 
Given the difficult financial situations faced by many Member States , however , he called on UNRWA to explore creative measures to alleviate its financial difficulties through alternative sources of income such as contributions from the private sector and expanded joint programmes with international organizations .  
Reaffirms the importance of ensuring the uniform and consistent application of the Convention and a coordinated approach to its overall implementation , and of strengthening technical cooperation and financial assistance for this purpose , stresses once again the continuing importance of the efforts of the Secretary-General to these ends , and reiterates its invitation to the competent international organizations and other international bodies to support these objectives ;  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
Calls upon the international financial institutions to ensure that in their development cooperation activities , the developing countries are not required to undertake obligations with regard to their development policies , strategies and programmes in trade and trade-related areas in excess or additional to those undertaken within the framework of rules agreed within the multilateral trading system ;  
Recognizing that the increasing globalization of financial markets and capital flows has presented Governments , the multilateral financial institutions and the international community at large with new challenges and opportunities for the mobilization of adequate and predictable resources for promoting economic development and social welfare ,  
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,  
Recognizing that the recent financial crisis has exposed the weaknesses of the present international financial system , and underlining the urgent need to work on a wide range of reforms for a stable and equitable international financial system in order to enable it to respond more effectively and in a timely manner to the challenges of development in the context of global financial integration ,  
Emphasizing that the United Nations , in fulfilling its role in the promotion of development , in particular of developing countries , should play a central role in the international efforts to build up the necessary international consensus on the wide range of reforms needed for a strengthened , stable and equitable international financial system responsive to the challenges of development , especially in the developing countries ,  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
It was high time that the basic rights recognized for national civil services and enshrined in ILO Conventions No . 98 and No . 154 should be recognized , with appropriate adjustments , for the international civil service , since it was unthinkable that ILO and the international financial institutions should fail to apply internally the basic rules they would like to see implemented internationally .  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to continue to implement the programme for the sustainable development of the region ;  
Again stresses the need for the international community to maintain its cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , with the Central American countries and to provide them with the necessary financial resources , in a sustained manner and on soft terms , with a view to promoting effectively sustainable human development and the consolidation of peace , freedom and democracy in the region ;  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to seek the cooperation of Governments , international organizations and non-governmental organizations to provide , within a mutually agreed framework of cooperation , the financial and technical support necessary for the reconstruction of a human rights infrastructure , including a strong civil society , in particular for the effective functioning of the National Human Rights Commission ;  
Good governance and transparency , good management of the State and financial and social policies should include : developing strategies for meeting the basic needs of the community , such as access to credit , in particular for women workers in the informal sector ; popular participation in decisions concerning the community ; equal opportunities in the competitive market economy and accountability in regard to the use of multilateral and bilateral financial aid .  
Concerned that , since the adoption of its resolutions 47 / 19 , 48 / 16 , 49 / 9 , 50 / 10 , 51 / 17 , 52 / 10 and 53 / 4 , further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic , commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied , and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries ,  
The Committee reiterates , in this connection , its request contained in its report on review of the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations that all future proposals by the Secretary-General on gratis personnel and the subsequent implementation of legislative mandates be in full compliance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and fully respect the relevant policies , procedures and regulations of the Organization ( A / 54 / 470 , para .  4 ) .  
Similarly , the rules of the multilateral financial institutions , implicit in the conditionalities of the IMF and the World Bank , which are applicable only to deficit countries or borrowing countries , should be reshaped so that the standardized package of policies , which is inflexible , is not imposed on countries , irrespective of time and space , particularly where some of its elements are not consistent with national development objectives in the long term .  
But almost all such diversification has occurred in the larger countries , with have more extensive economic infrastructures , higher levels of labour and technical skills and better access to financial sources , than the small or poor countries , especially those exporting commodities in structural surplus .  
Such low-income countries find considerable difficulty in attracting private foreign investment or loans from commercial banks , while loans from the international financial institutions have generally been concentrated in the larger countries .  
First were matters relating to the macroeconomic management of the world economy : institution of more effective macroeconomic coordination and of improved monitoring and surveillance of international financial flows , arrangements for quicker response to crises , and ending of a system where the private sector was too readily rescued from the risks attendant on its own imprudence .  
Globalization should therefore be re-examined from four broad perspectives : democratization of international economic decision-making ; integrated consideration of trade , finance and developmental issues by international institutions ; reform of the international financial architecture ; and effective action against the marginalization of developing countries .  
His delegation was convinced that the success of all the measures envisaged would be contingent on the restructuring of the international financial and monetary architecture to ensure a more stable and participatory system and the provision of coherent links between finance , trade and development .  
The solution lay in a globalization of development , and Pakistan therefore proposed the consideration of the following issues : creation of an enabling international economic environment ; reform of the global financial architecture ; integrated consideration of trade , finance and developmental issues ; a comprehensive and durable solution to the debt problem ; and fulfilment by the developed countries of their commitment to provide 0.7 per cent of their GNP to ODA .  
His Government was troubled by the financial crises that had emerged in recent years , in view of their considerable impact on the international system , and it urged the establishment of a stable monetary system at the regional level .  
The rapid growth of capital markets and financial liberalization was the other key pillar of globalization which had been projected as providing a definitive solution to the resources constraint that developing countries had traditionally faced .  
The issue becomes even more complicated when common procurement , personnel and budgetary services covering all organizations and specialized agencies at Geneva are considered , since those entities have , inter alia , different mandates , funding sources and modalities , varying budgetary and financial rules , and divergent personnel policies and procedures .  
Recognizing the valuable and effective economic and financial contribution that some organs , organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and the international community have made to complementing national and subregional efforts to advance the process of democratization , rehabilitation and development in southern Africa ,  
Appeals to the international community and to relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system to continue providing , where appropriate , financial , technical and material assistance to the Community in order to enable it to implement fully its Programme of Action and to meet the reconstruction and rehabilitation needs of the region and to further advance the process of regional economic integration ;  
Considering that the Caribbean Sea area includes a large number of States , countries and territories , most of which are developing countries and small island developing States which are ecologically fragile and economically vulnerable and also affected by , inter alia , their limited capacity , narrow resource base , need for financial resources , social problems , high levels of poverty and the challenges and opportunities of globalization ,  
Recognizing that mutually supportive efforts at the national and international levels are imperative in the pursuit of sustainable development , which includes , inter alia , the provision of financial resources and the transfer of technology for the application of cost-effective energy systems and wider use of environmentally friendly , renewable energies ,  
Calls upon Member States to promote the facilitation of cooperative actions between the United Nations system and the civil society , through national volunteer corps , in order to strengthen the United Nations capacities for early and effective response to humanitarian emergencies , and invites them to make the commensurate financial resources available through the special financing window of the Special Voluntary Fund of the United Nations Volunteers ;  
Calls upon all countries to ensure the provision of sufficient financial resources , on a stable and predictable basis , for the successful implementation of the work programme for the biennium 2000-2001 , and reiterates the recognition by the Commission on Human Settlements at its seventeenth session that this implementation will require substantial additional funding and its request to the Executive Director to raise more funds from all sources and to broaden the donor base ;  
The relationship between the environment and mankind had been discussed at Rio , where it had been recognized that States had common but differentiated responsibilities and that sustainable development required adequate scientific , technical and financial resources .  
Regrettably , the United Nations system continued to face constraints already addressed in earlier sustainable development efforts , including lack of financial and human resources , lack of institutional capacity , and vague mandates and roles of agencies , as mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report ( A / 54 / 131 ) .  
A recent report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) on geographically mobile activities and financial and other service activities , referring to what it described as harmful tax practices , wrongly identified a number of Caribbean countries as tax havens and proposed a number of punitive measures that apart from being unjustified would be detrimental to those countries growing dependence on the important financial services sector .  
Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti is continuing to implement a structural adjustment programme , and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences , in particular the social consequences , of that adjustment policy , so that the country may achieve lasting economic results ,  
I , General legislative and institutional framework , para . 25 ) , one of the initial steps that should be taken by the Government in relation to a proposed infrastructure project is to conduct a preliminary assessment of its feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility .  
In order to consider adequately the financial feasibility of the proposals and the likelihood of subsequent increases in the proposed prices , additional criteria may need to be considered , such as the costs for design and construction activities ; annual operation and maintenance costs ; present value of capital costs and operating costs ; and the amount of subsidy , if any , expected from the Government .  
Calls upon all Governments and all relevant United Nations organizations and multilateral and regional financial institutions to consider increasing allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to strengthen funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Recognizing the valuable and effective economic and financial contribution that some organs , organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and the international community have made to complementing national and subregional efforts to advance the process of democratization , rehabilitation and development in southern Africa ,  
Appeals to the international community and to relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system to continue providing , where appropriate , financial , technical and material assistance to the Community in order to enable it to implement fully its Programme of Action and to meet the reconstruction and rehabilitation needs of the region and to further advance the process of regional economic integration ;  
Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
Noting with great concern that one of the major obstacles to the speedy implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative is financial constraints , stressing the need for fair , equitable and transparent burden-sharing among the international public creditor community and other donor countries and , in this regard , stressing also that the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Trust Fund must be adequately funded ,  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Considering that the Caribbean Sea area includes a large number of States , countries and territories , most of which are developing countries and small island developing States which are ecologically fragile and economically vulnerable and also affected by , inter alia , their limited capacity , narrow resource base , need for financial resources , social problems , high levels of poverty and the challenges and opportunities of globalization ,  
Recognizing that mutually supportive efforts at the national and international levels are imperative in the pursuit of sustainable development , which includes , inter alia , the provision of financial resources and the transfer of technology for the application of cost-effective energy systems and wider use of environmentally friendly , renewable energies ,  
To encourage and persuade other States Parties and financial institutions to join them in the transfer of technology and increased technical cooperation by providing more training programmes and modern equipment to developing countries in order to assist them in achieving the objectives of this Convention . 3 .  These measures shall be without prejudice to existing foreign investment commitments or to other financial cooperation arrangements at the bilateral , regional or international level .  
The Forum underscored the need for implementation of strategies in terms of investment , mobilization of domestic and international resources and in the case of developing countries , with special attention to least developed countries and developing countries with low forest cover appropriate financial mechanisms and / or measures including support through official development assistance ( ODA ) .  
Recognizing that the increasing globalization of financial markets and capital flows have presented Governments , the multilateral financial institutions and the international community at large with new challenges and opportunities for the mobilization of adequate and more stable resources for promoting economic development and social welfare ,  
Recognizing that the recent financial crises have exposed weaknesses in the international financial system , and underlining the urgent need to continue to work on a wide range of reforms for a strengthened and more stable and international financial system , with a view to enabling it to deal more effectively and in a timely manner with the new challenges of development in the context of global financial integration ,  
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts , in order to promote international financial stability , and to this end to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crisis in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective , while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Reiterates its call upon the international community to pursue national , regional and international efforts to contribute to minimizing negative impacts of excessive volatility of global financial flows , reiterates in this context the need to consider the establishment of regulatory frameworks for short-term capital flows and trade in currencies , and invites the International Monetary Fund and the relevant regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
The need for greater support for the developing countries had to be seen in the context of four important realities : firstly , unless effective measures were taken at national and global levels to regulate , supervise and control financial activities and international capital flows , financial instability would continue to recur with increasing frequency and ferocity , destroying the most fragile economies and vulnerable populations and crippling their efforts to eradicate poverty .  
While developed countries had remained relatively unscathed by the recent financial crisis , in developing countries the gains of decades of economic and social progress had been erased overnight and millions had been thrown back into poverty .  
A continuing debate on institutional issues was essential in order to promote a stable and equitable international financial system that was supportive of long-term development .  
Global financial integration had helped generate strong private capital flows to some developing countries , but had also posed enormous challenges to national financial and banking systems in terms of ensuring the sustainability of those flows .  
Mr . Robertson ( New Zealand ) said that his delegation was committed to joining in the efforts to address the issues raised in the wake of the recent international financial crisis , namely , how to address stability in financial markets , how to find appropriate domestic and international policies to meet developmental challenges and how to secure greater coherence in the international financial and development system .  
On the basis of that resolution and in order to provide input to the report being prepared by the Secretary-General , his Government , with the support of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean , had organized a High-level Regional Meeting Towards a stable and predictable international financial system and its relationship to social development , which had been held in Mexico City from 5 to 7 September ( A / 54 / 384 ) .  
Many countries were unwilling to sustain the increasingly heavy financial , political , environmental and social burdens that resulted from accommodating vast numbers of refugees .  
Calls upon all countries to ensure the provision of sufficient financial resources , on a stable and predictable basis , for the successful implementation of the work programme for the biennium 2000-2001 , and reiterates the recognition by the Commission on Human Settlements at its seventeenth session that this implementation will require substantial additional funding and its request to the Executive Director to raise more funds from all sources and to broaden the donor base ;  
Measures requiring financial institutions and other professions involved in financial transactions to utilize the most efficient measures available for the identification of their usual or occasional customers , as well as customers in whose interest accounts are opened , and to pay special attention to unusual or suspicious transactions and report transactions suspected of stemming from a criminal activity . 
Adopting regulations imposing on financial institutions the obligation to report promptly to the competent authorities all complex , unusual large transactions and unusual patterns of transactions , which have no apparent economic or obviously lawful purpose , without fear of assuming criminal or civil liability for breach of any restriction on disclosure of information if they report their suspicions in good faith ;  
In accordance with current procedures , the Advisory Committee expects that full justification for the requirements of all support account posts will be provided in the context of the comprehensive annual proposals on the total requirement for human and financial resources from all sources of funding for all departments involved in the backstopping of peacekeeping operations to be submitted to the General Assembly , through the Advisory Committee , in spring 2000 .  
Also stresses the importance of additional debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Noting with great concern that one of the major obstacles to the speedy implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative is financial constraints , stressing the need for fair , equitable and transparent burden-sharing among the international public creditor community and other donor countries , and in this regard stressing also that the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Trust Fund must be adequately funded ,  
Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the adverse effects of the international financial crises on the mobilization of both domestic and external resources for the development of the developing countries , including those in Africa and the least developed countries ;  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to seek the cooperation of Governments , international organizations and non-governmental organizations to provide , within a mutually agreed framework of cooperation , the financial and technical support necessary for the reconstruction of a human rights infrastructure , including a strong civil society , in particular for the effective functioning of the National Human Rights Commission , was revised to read :  
While the military authorities and police had improved their methods and capabilities for combating drug trafficking by acquiring greater logistical , financial and human resources , international cooperation still remained essential , since it enabled the States concerned to exchange reliable information and advanced technologies .  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasising also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Calls for increased international cooperation to address the challenges of globalization through the enhanced participation of developing countries in the international economic policy decision-making process ; integrated consideration of trade , finance , technology transfer and development issues by the relevant international institutions ; and continuation of a wide range of reforms of the international financial system ;  
Calls upon all countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Transnational organized crime includes tax evasion , the forgery of clothes and electronic equipment , fraud against international financial institutions , unfair competition on international markets , industrial espionage , the import and export of protected plants and animals , trafficking in works of art and the illegal dumping of toxic industrial waste .  
Some studies indicate that criminal groups are slowly abandoning their involvement in visible economic activities and are diverting criminal profits towards the more secretive financial sector . 7 This diversion is said to make detection more difficult and the confiscation of assets problematic . 
The entry of transnational criminal operators in the financial world is believed to herald potential disruption , distortion of rules , erosion of ethics and suppression of competition ; ultimately , it is assumed to foster a purge among entrepreneurs , leading to the survival of those more criminally fit . 
In accordance with a guideline laid down by the Board of Trustees , the Fund as a rule only finances up to a third ( 33.33 per cent ) of any programme of assistance submitted to it and only finances those activities of an organization that are intended to provide the victims of torture with direct medical , psychological , psychiatric , economic , social , humanitarian or legal assistance ; it does not provide financial aid for other victims or other activities of the help organizations .  
At the 42nd meeting , on 18 November , the representative of Guyana , on behalf of the States Members of the United Nations that are members of the Group of 77 and China and Mexico , introduced a draft resolution entitled Towards a stable and equitable international financial system , responsive to the challenges of development , especially in the developing countries ( A / C . 2 / 54 / L . 38 ) , which read : The General Assembly ,  
Recognizing that the increasing globalization of financial markets and capital flows has presented Governments , the multilateral financial institutions and the international community at large with new challenges and opportunities for the mobilization of adequate and predictable resources for promoting economic development and social welfare ,  
Stressing the importance of the provision of adequate financial resources for the development of developing countries , including through public and private financial flows , international trade , official development assistance and debt relief , and that the comprehensive and integrated consideration of these issues should constitute a very important element of the dialogue and collaboration between the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods institutions ,  
Recognizing that the recent financial crisis has exposed the weaknesses of the present international financial system , and underlining the urgent need to work on a wide range of reforms for a stable and equitable international financial system in order to enable it to respond more effectively and in a timely manner to the challenges of development in the context of global financial integration ,  
Emphasizing that the United Nations , in fulfilling its role in the promotion of development , in particular of developing countries , should play a central role in the international efforts to build up the necessary international consensus on the wide range of reforms needed for a strengthened , stable and equitable international financial system responsive to the challenges of development , especially in the developing countries ,  
Recognizes the importance of international financial stability , and in this context calls on developed countries , in particular major industrialized countries , to ensure that their macroeconomic policies are consistent with the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , including through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including adequate institutional arrangements both in the countries of origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
At the 49th meeting , on 14 December , the Vice-Chairman of the Committee , Giovanni Brauzzi ( Italy ) , introduced , a draft resolution entitled Towards a stable international financial system responsive to the challenges of development , especially in the developing countries ( A / C . 2 / 54 / L . 72 ) , which he submitted on the basis of informal consultations held on draft resolution A / C . 2 / 54 / L . 38 . 
Recognizing that the increasing globalization of financial markets and capital flows has presented Governments , the multilateral financial institutions and the international community at large with new challenges and opportunities for the mobilization of adequate and more stable resources for promoting economic development and social welfare ,  
Recognizing that the recent financial crises have exposed weaknesses in the international financial system , and underlining the urgent need to continue to work on a wide range of reforms for a strengthened and more stable international financial system with a view to enabling it to deal more effectively and in a timely manner with the new challenges of development in the context of global financial integration ,  
Emphasizes the need to renew national , regional and international efforts to promote international financial stability and , to this end , to improve early warning , prevention and response capabilities for dealing with the emergence and spread of financial crises in a timely manner , taking a comprehensive and long-term perspective while remaining responsive to the challenges of development and the protection of the most vulnerable countries and social groups ;  
Stresses the importance at the national level of strong domestic institutions to promote the achievement of growth and development , inter alia , through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory and supervisory systems of the financial and banking sectors , including appropriate institutional arrangements in the countries of both origin and destination of international capital flows ;  
Reiterates its call upon the international community to pursue national , regional and international efforts to contribute to minimizing the negative impacts of excessive volatility of global financial flows , reiterates in this context the need to consider the establishment of regulatory frameworks for short-term capital flows and trade in currencies , and invites the International Monetary Fund and the relevant regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
That was why Tunisia supported the establishment of a multilateral mechanism to control foreign capital movements and speculative flows in order to stabilize and regulate the international financial and monetary system .  
In the present case the need was to pursue the globalization of development , a process entailing the creation of an enabling international economic environment , reform of the global financial architecture , a comprehensive solution to the problem of the external debt of the developing countries , the provision of adequate aid for them , and the establishment of a fair trade agenda .  
The matter of displaced persons and refugees could be settled only with the participation of the international community as a whole in establishing plans for integrated economic and social development through increased financial and technical cooperation .  
Joint actions by the States Parties to promote trade and economic cooperation and overcome the consequences of the financial and economic crisis have been agreed , the foundations for joint customs tariffs have been laid , and measures to strengthen cooperation between national monetary and financial systems have been defined .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
Noting further that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
In view of the serious financial implications of the increased and unprecedented number of ex post facto presentations by field missions , regional economic commissions and international criminal tribunals to their respective local Committees on Contracts , and , when required , to the Headquarters Committee on Contracts ( " the Committee " ) , and in order to ameliorate the adverse consequences of this improper practice , the following provisions should be implemented immediately :  
We attach particular importance to paragraphs 3 and 4 of the resolution , by which the General Assembly emphasizes that all future and existing peacekeeping missions shall be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements and shall be provided with adequate resources for the effective and efficient discharge of their respective mandates .  
During the past four years under Mr . Ricupero ' s stewardship , UNCTAD has played a positive role in promoting the economic growth and development of the developing countries and has helped them significantly to integrate into the world economy , participate effectively in multilateral trade negotiations , predict and analyze financial crises and assess the impact of such crises on the promotion of international investment.He has also helped to channel assistance to the least developed countries .  
Notes the importance of joint efforts to overcome the constraints in implementing the Programme of Action , by achieving , inter alia , a higher level of political support , durable political solutions to conflicts , further democratization and building of civil society , full implementation of legislation , adequate cooperation on a regional or bilateral level , deeper involvement of international financial institutions and development agencies , and availability of financial resources ;  
Enhancing coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development and avoidance of international financial crisis and excessive financial volatility , and enhancing effective participation and integration of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the global economic system , including through capacity-building ;  
Internal enabling environment : policy framework incentives for domestic private savings , equitable tax systems ( development and enforcement of ) , macroeconomic policies , disincentives to corruption ; good governance ; transparency ; effective regulatory and supervisory framework for the financial sector ; banking infrastructure , pension funds ; corporate governance ; internationally accepted accounting standards , and a sound legal system ( land and property rights ) ;  
The view was expressed that an educational institution should have been included among the public non-profit sector employers in order to have at least one employer working in the same substantive field as UNESCO , instead of four financial sector employers . 6 Furthermore , it would have been preferable if a more representative employer such as the French career civil service or the Ministry of Culture ( instead of the Snat ) , had been included . 
The Unit is composed of 11 Inspectors having experience in national or international administrative and financial matters , including management questions , and are appointed by the General Assembly on the basis of equitable geographical distribution .  
The liberalization of international trade , production and financial transactions , the increasing influence of global corporations and developments in information technology and communications all components of the globalization process are increasingly being considered from the perspective of their individual and collective impact on respect for human rights .  
In this context , the additional resources would enable the Secretary-General to make available an expanded range of programmes aimed at building and strengthening core organizational and managerial competencies ; to provide greater opportunities for staff at all levels to upgrade specific technical and substantive skills ; to support decentralization of human and financial resource management responsibilities and to strengthen career support mechanisms .  
The increase in the level of resources requested in 20002001 should be viewed in the context of the historically low levels of funding provided for programmes of preventive maintenance and repair and the significant reductions effected in this section in previous bienniums during periods of severe financial constraint in lieu of higher-priority substantive programme activities .  
In order to give a rough idea of what that volume of capital means , I must point out that a single day of operations in the financial markets is equivalent to twice the annual gross national product of all the African countries .  
This policy has also included the organization and support of armed groups ; air and naval raids against our territory ; the hatching of over 600 plots to assassinate the leader of our revolution ; a military invasion by a mercenary army ; the most serious threat ever of a global nuclear conflict , in October 1962 ; and finally , a brutal commercial and financial blockade and a ferocious economic war against my country that have now lasted 40 years .  
For this fight against poverty and this campaign for emancipation to succeed , we must agree to a decisive review of the mechanism that underlies the economic fluctuation , that causes financial tension and its attendant social consequences , and that tolerates massive exploitation of the weakest by forces that are often impersonal and unidentifiable .  
The State of Bahrain is pleased and willing to contribute to international efforts aimed at achieving increased international economic cooperation , due to its stability and strategic location , and the trade and investment environment it enjoys elements that have helped it attract foreign capital and enhance its standing as an advanced financial and commercial centre .  
The eradication of poverty remains the foremost challenge for the developing world , where policy makers struggle on a daily basis to respond to the most basic needs of their peoples despite dwindling financial resources , disappointing economic growth rates and their countries growing marginalization in the worlds economy .  
These include strengthening the financial and economic architecture at the macro level , while at the national level promoting explicit pro-poor policies , investment in basic social services , participatory strategies and the empowerment of women .  
The inherent burdens of a weak banking and financial system , insignificant foreign investment , unfavourable market conditions and inefficient State enterprises , coupled with a lack of free - market traditions and experience , have compounded the reform challenge .  
To some extent , we are losing sight of the fact that political , humanitarian and financial crises have serious social consequences that have a particularly harsh impact at the community level long after necessary and welcome decisions begin to have a positive effect in specific areas .  
In the four years since the Summit , the developing countries have enjoyed little in the way of the technical and financial cooperation for development that was committed and certainly they have not engaged the path to rapid , broad-based sustainable development.It is in fact somewhat difficult to undertake a review of progress made in follow-up activities when the economic picture today is bleaker than it was at the time of the Summit .  
Here , too , it is apparent that without a more favourable international environment , without significant financial input , without real alleviation , if not outright cancellation , of the debt and without a sustained and lasting rate of growth , the laudable and courageous efforts and the sacrifices made so far by the African countries will prove insufficient , if not useless , in the face of the great needs of the African peoples .  
Thus , as was so well pointed out by the Economic and Social Council during its substantive session in 1999 , the international community has a deciding role to play in supporting action to eliminate poverty , promote productive employment , achieve gender equality and mobilize new and additional financial resources in order to guarantee the implementation of the agreed objectives of social development .  
The ensuing concentration of power and influence lies in the hands of those nations , institutions and individuals that can master the wealth of information on all aspects of human interaction , be it economic , financial , political , social or cultural .  
The IPU has taken up the cause of the large segment of humanity which is not a beneficiary of globalization and , at the recent conference in Berlin , discussed the need to revise the current global financial and economic model , and adopted a resolution which called for special initiatives for underdeveloped , debt-ridden countries .  
One-thousand-six-hundred representatives from 131 countries came to Berlin and cooperated in the drafting of important resolutions on the promotion of international humanitarian law ; on the peaceful coexistence of ethnic , cultural and religious minorities , including migrant populations within a single State ; and on the need to revise the current global financial and economic model .  
Our strong moral , political and financial support for the Tribunal will ensure not only that future dictatorial regimes will be effectively prosecuted for their actions , but that there will never be a repeat of genocide in our continent or , indeed , worldwide .  
Mr . Mra ( Myanmar ) : First of all , I would like to express my delegations appreciation for the Secretary-Generals report contained in document A 54-259 , dated 18 August 1999 , on agenda item 33 , entitled Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
In keeping with these positions and on the basis of the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter and universally recognized principles of international law , Mali will this year again associate itself with the Member States calling for the lifting the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed on Cuba by the United States of America .  
The rejection of this hostile policy directed at Cuba was also expressed by the leaders of the non-aligned countries during their twelfth summit meeting , held in Durban in September 1998 ; Malaysia strongly supported the final document of that summit , wherein the heads of State or Government of the non-aligned countries reiterated their call upon the Government of the United States of America to put an end to the economic , commercial and financial actions against Cuba .  
In this light , it is pertinent to note that the meeting of Ministers for Foreign Affairs and heads of delegations of the Non-Aligned Movement during the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly , held in New York on 23 September 1999 , once again called on the parties concerned to strictly comply with the relevant United Nations resolutions and emphasized the need to terminate the economic , commercial and financial sanctions against Cuba .  
In the context of the process of growing interdependence , even as calls are being made for free access to financial markets , goods , services , it is paradoxical to witness situations in which obstacles to such interaction are erected unilaterally and without regard for their effects upon the human development of a people even more so when we see that those obstacles are erected by applying internal norms with extraterritorial scope or effects that run counter to international public law .  
The report ( A 54-259 ) of the Secretary-General shows , as have his previous reports on the subject , the destructive results of the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba as a coercive and unilateral measure .  
Mr . Nejad Hosseinian ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) : In almost all United Nations resolutions and decisions on financial and commercial issues and related final declarations and conclusions of high-level meetings in this system , the critical need for an equitable , secure , non-discriminatory and predictable multilateral trading system has been emphasized .  
Continued financial assistance from the international community for the Bethlehem 2000 project is needed for the creation of a strong , self-sufficient and sustainable economic infrastructure for Bethlehem that would provide a sound underpinning for social and political stability , which is a prerequisite for peace in the region .  
In the light of extensive measures under way to firmly set the University for Peace on a strong platform , adequate and proportionate financial support from various sources is required .  
The first stage was mine removal associated with the demarcation of the Peruvian-Ecuadorian border , which , under mutual agreement with Ecuador , was performed with national resources and the supplementary technical and financial support of four friendly countries : Canada , Spain , the United States and Japan , to whom we reaffirm our gratitude for their swift and favourable acceptance of our requests for assistance . 
Due to the magnitude of the problem and the climatic and geographic characteristics of mined zones , we believe that this stage can be executed within the time-frame stipulated by the Ottawa Convention only if we can gain access to technical and financial cooperation and to logistical support given by other States parties to the Ottawa Convention , non-governmental organizations and international organizations that are committed to the cause of achieving a world free of anti-personnel mines .  
My delegation also wishes to emphasize the fact that , for a country like Cambodia , which is one of the least developed countries , as long as the mine problem is our main concern , continued financial and technical assistance will remain essential to our mine clearance efforts if we are to rid ourselves of this silent and indiscriminate killer .  
Therefore we hope to continue to have the solidarity and the support of the United Nations system , as well as of international financial organizations and the donor community , especially those that pledged their commitment in the Stockholm Declaration , as their invaluable assistance is vital in order to overcome the structural problems underlying the effects of natural disasters .  
With its unsurpassed costs in terms of human and financial numbers , claiming some 50 , 000 victims and causing economic losses exceeding $ 90-billion throughout the world , 1998 was an annus horribilis , that clearly illustrated the extreme vulnerability of developing countries to natural disasters of all types .  
As our experience suggests , the greatest challenge that committed leaders of a developing country with a transitional economy and a new democracy face is to manage the tension that exists between democracy , seen and perceived as meaning a better life , and the harsh reality of financial constraints , lack of resources , structural inefficiencies and bad practices that need time to be fully addressed and resolved .  
New or restored democracies need : fair treatment with respect to the debts they inherited from anti-democratic governments ; preferential access to major world markets ; concessionary credit policies by international financial institutions ; cooperation in the economic , technological and educational spheres ; and the advantages to be gained from aid and assistance programmes by international organizations for our countries most vulnerable populations .  
We also call on the United Nations to increase its assistance to the OAU in order to strengthen the operational and institutional capabilities of its Mechanism for Conflict Prevention , Management and Resolution in Africa , in particular by developing the Organizations regional capabilities in early warning and logistical support and by mobilizing the financial resources generated by the two trust funds established by the United Nations and the OAU for those purposes .  
We have seen that even in times of dire financial strife , this Organization has demonstrated its comparative advantage in attracting international attention and mobilizing a concerted and timely response to the plight of hundreds of thousands worldwide who have had their lives and those of their families shattered simply because of meteorological and seismic forces beyond their control .  
During the debate , the following major points emerged : globalization and the international financial crisis ; the decline of official development assistance and debt-relief initiatives ; good governance ; people-centred development ; poverty eradication ; the creation of productive employment opportunities ; basic social services ; and the role of civil society in decision-making , resource allocation , development and human security .  
Iraq was one of the pioneers in adopting organized scientific planning to mobilize and develop human and financial resources so as to achieve sustainable economic growth aimed at bringing about the prosperity of human beings and at maintaining their right to their natural resources and their environmental rights .  
However , it is always worth remembering that sustainable development is conditional upon a rapid stabilization of the worlds population , which keeps on growing , particularly in the poor countries , where growth rates are highest , and requires , despite the progress that has been made in the last five years , the mobilization of sufficient resources from the international community , and from the donor countries in particular , to enable the poor countries to overcome their financial limitations . 
The impact of this policy would have been all the greater on reproductive health and family-planning questions if the adequate financial means had been available to complement the limited capacities of my country , which has been shaken by an unprecedented financial crisis and the political transition difficulties of establishing stable democratic institutions .  
The Commission reiterated the need for more focused action at all levels , including the international level , to strengthen support , including financial support from all sources , to small island developing States for programmes and projects targeted towards capacity-building and institutional building , facilitating the access of small island developing States to and transfer and use of environmentally sound technology , as set forth in the Programme of Action .  
Taking into account the dependency of small island developing States on conventional energy sources , there is a need for mobilization of resources from all sources , including from the private sector , for the provision of technical , financial and technological assistance , as appropriate , to small island developing States , to encourage energy efficiency , and to accelerate and maximize the development and utilization of environmentally sound renewable energy sources .  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
Building on the recent small island developing States donors meeting , with special consideration from the international community for new and additional financial commitments and disbursements of resources , as well as better and more efficient use of ODA and other existing external sources of finance , taking into account the specific development needs and priorities of small island developing States ;  
We must express , however , our deep concern that , while at the national level the small island developing States have seriously demonstrated their resolve to implement the Barbados Programme of Action , as they agreed to do five years ago , the adequate and predictable financial resources that the international community pledged to provide to support the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action have not been fully provided .  
The State of Bahrain has put forward plans for two important projects in the field of biological diversity and integrated environmental management , with a view to obtaining financial and technical support through the Ministerial Conference of the small island developing States of the Atlantic Ocean , the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean , held in Malta in November 1998 .  
What is particularly noteworthy is that , with the accelerated pace of globalization and ever-fiercer international competition , small island developing States are encountering increasingly grave challenges as a result of serious constraints such as lack of financial , technological and human resources .  
The unfortunate consequences of deterioration in the economic environment , particularly in connection with the global financial crisis , brought , in some cases , a reversal of social gains , while there was an increase in human suffering and deprivation.In the affected countries , the impact of economic adversity was felt at all levels of society , but the poorest segments carry a disproportionate burden .  
Acknowledges that national machineries are necessary for the implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action ; and that for national machineries to be effective , clear mandates , location at the highest possible level , accountability mechanisms , partnership with civil society , a transparent political process , adequate financial and human resources and continued strong political commitment are crucial ;  
Representatives emphasized that national machineries , in order to carry out their functions , should be equipped with adequate human and financial resources and be located where they could effectively influence government policy , preferably at a high government level , and where they can be protected from frequent political changes .  
Completion of the establishment of the clearing house mechanism to provide decision makers in all States with direct access to relevant information , practical experience and scientific and technical expertise , and to facilitate effective scientific , technical and financial cooperation as well as capacity-building and the transfer of environmentally sound technology in the context described in paragraph 3 ( d ) above ;  
Increase efforts to address the critical issues of fresh water and sanitation in human settlements in developing countries through , inter alia , the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the provision of financial resources for implementation , as elaborated in Agenda 21 , as a priority of the international agenda on sustainable consumption and production ;  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
Recognizes that the lack of human , technical or financial resources at national level could be hindering the submission of more voluntary national reports or relevant information ;  
It might consider such issues as ( a ) financial leakages and how to maximize benefits for local communities , ( b ) preparing a joint initiative to improve information availability and capacity-building for participation , thus enabling communities to manage social and environmental change and ( c ) developing a plan to ensure indigenous peoples and other local communities their rights to land , water and other natural resources .  
For many developing countries , human , technical and financial resources are still not adequate , imposing severe restraints on their domestic capacity to meet the requirements of developing and using sustainable energy systems .  
Yet while IMF rigorously monitored loan recipient countries ' compliance with loan conditions for financial reform , it only lamented the ill _ effects on economic , social and cultural rights and left them to be dealt with by other international organizations and bodies .  
Globalization had taken real power from States and vested it in an apparatus governing the world ' s political , financial , economic and military systems , consisting principally of the Group of Seven , IMF , the World Bank , WTO ( and , by extension , the major transnational corporations ) , the Security Council and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .  
UNDP ' s financial assistance to basic education was directed to primary education and alternative programmes , early childhood development , basic education for youth and adults , and education through traditional and modern media and social action .  
She deplored the fact that resource allocation and financial decisions were sometimes motivated by ideological choices which were opposed to the principle of universal , free and compulsory education even at the primary level .  
Recommends that , given the extent of the burgeoning energy demand and the financial constraints in developing countries , partnerships and collaboration on renewable as well as on conventional sources of energy , such as those envisaged in the clean development mechanism and the joint implementation arrangements envisioned in the context of the Kyoto Protocol8 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change , 9 should be increased in order to :  
The Committee will consider relevant organizational and supportive arrangements for technical cooperation among developing countries , such as administrative , legal , informational and financial arrangements .  
Furthermore , the trade imbalances between developed and developing economies , favouring the more developed economies , place development at risk in many countries , and the current global financial crisis compounds the difficulty of social , economic and political development . 
On that occasion the Heads of State or Government reiterated their concern over the fact that the arms race absorbs a major proportion of human , financial , material and technological resources in today ' s world , imposes a heavy burden on the economies of all countries , in particular developing countries , and affects international trade and financial and technological flows .  
Despite the budgetary constraints imposed by the current international financial crisis , Brazil had already pledged a contribution to the Trust Fund set up to support the activities of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and encouraged other countries to do the same .  
Taking note of the decision contained in the recently adopted General Assembly resolution 53-12 on the rapidly deployable mission headquarters , China considered that in the current difficult financial situation faced by the United Nations and the relative scaling down of peacekeeping operations , the efforts to strengthen the rapid deployment capability should be focused on tapping the full potential of current mechanisms .  
He therefore rejected the notion that the permanent members of the Security Council had a special financial responsibility for the non-peacekeeping activities of the United Nations , as well as the idea that the low per capita income adjustment should not be applied to the permanent members of the Council or that a regular budget floor rate should be set for those States .  
18 . Reaffirms the importance of ensuring the uniform and consistent application of the Convention and a coordinated approach to its overall implementation , and of strengthening technical cooperation and financial assistance for this purpose , stresses once again the continuing importance of the efforts of the Secretary-General to these ends , and reiterates its invitation to the competent international organizations and other international bodies to support these objectives ;  
While the Government of Ethiopia is encouraged by the results achieved and is committed to continuing the demining programme , it is recognized at the same time that much remains to be done to get rid of all the landmines scattered in various parts of the country , and that this immense task can not be completed without international support in the form of technical and financial assistance .  
The Russian Federation has made progress in putting together a comprehensive programme for destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile , including the identification of destruction sites , the technology needed for destruction , protection of the environment , the agencies responsible and the overall financial requirements , which has been approved by President Yeltsin . A draft law , which will establish the legal framework for destruction , has received its first hearing in the Duma .  
Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti is continuing to implement a structural adjustment programme , and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences , in particular the social consequences , of that adjustment policy , so that the country may achieve lasting economic results ,  
The General Assembly has established the following six main committees : First Committee , disarmament and international security issues ; Second Committee , economic and financial issues ; Third Committee , social , humanitarian and cultural issues ; Fourth Committee , special political and decolonization issues ; Fifth Committee , administrative and budgetary issues ; and Sixth Committee , legal issues .  
AAPSO remains concerned about the impunity of international financial institutions , which are not held accountable for the negative impact of their policies on domestic economic and social conditions .  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasizing also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
The international community also has an important role in assisting developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , economies in transition and small island developing States , through the provision of financial and technical assistance to governments at all levels , to develop a range of meaningful and effective planning guidelines , codes of good practice , regulatory frameworks and policy provisions aimed at achieving sustainable tourism .  
The attention of the Commission is also drawn to Economic and Social Council decision 1998-281 , by which the Council , taking note of Commission on Human Rights decision 1998-111 , decided to authorize , if possible within existing financial resources , 30 fully serviced additional meetings , including summary records , in accordance with rules 29 and 31 of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , for the Commission ' s fifty _ fifth session .  
In what could well prove to be an exemplary effort to meet the challenges of post-conflict reconstruction and resettlement in war-torn areas , international humanitarian and development agencies , and financial institutions have forged partnerships amongst themselves and with the Government with the common aim of assisting the Government in creating possibilities for return as a durable solution .  
The resumption of dialogue with the international financial institutions and with private and official bilateral partners could enable these objectives to be met through the sound macroeconomic policies to which the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is committed .  
Regretting that the current crisis in financial markets , characterized , inter alia , by massive and sudden outflows of capital from the affected countries and the sharp decline in private capital flows to developing countries and some economies in transition , has resulted in higher interest rate spreads , leading to a significant slowdown in economic activity ,  
Deeply concerned that the international financial crisis has acquired extremely worrying dimensions , posing a threat to world economic development , and that if it were allowed to continue financial turmoil could result in major setbacks to the global economy , in particular to the progress that most developing countries have achieved in the 1990 s ,  
Recognizing that the current crisis has exposed weaknesses in the international financial system and the urgent need to work on a wide range of reforms to create a strengthened international financial system with a view to enabling it to deal more effectively and in a timely manner with the new challenges of global financial integration ,  
Also stresses the importance at the national level of sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening institutional capacities and regulatory frameworks , especially the regulatory and supervisory systems of the domestic financial and banking sectors ;  
Stresses the need to endow the International Monetary Fund with adequate resources to provide emergency financing to countries affected by financial crises as a result , among others , of the high volatility of international capital flows , and in this context also stresses the importance of sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the institutional capacities and regulatory frameworks ;  
Also stresses the need to strengthen international and national financial systems through a more effective national , regional and international surveillance of both the public and private sectors , based upon the improvement of the availability and transparency of information , as well as the strengthening of the role of the International Monetary Fund in this regard , and the collaboration of the World Bank with technical assistance and capacity-building in this matter ;  
Emphasizes that the opening of the capital account must be carried out in an orderly , gradual and well-sequenced manner , keeping its pace in line with the strengthening of the ability of countries to sustain its consequences , underscores the crucial importance in this regard of solid domestic financial systems and of an effective prudential framework , and invites the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and relevant international regulatory bodies to contribute to this process ;  
Calls upon the international community to pursue national and international efforts , at the intergovernmental and inter-agency levels , to contribute to minimizing the excessive volatility of global financial flows and to distribute in a more equitable manner the costs of systemic adjustments between the public and private sectors ;  
Providing increased financial and technical assistance to small island developing States for building human resource and institutional capacity at the national and regional levels ;  
The development of renewable energy sources will depend not only on the choice of appropriate technology but also on adequate development of managerial and technical expertise , careful financial management and adoption of appropriate institutional approaches .  
For small loads typical of rural households in remote areas with sufficient insolation , solar PV systems are proving to be economically and technically successful , when complemented by an institutional approach , including financial arrangements , that provides for the installation of the systems and maintenance on a fee-for-service basis .  
The unique social , economic and environmental characteristics of small island developing States , such as high population density , relative isolation , limited availability of land space , and paucity of human and financial resources , limit the range of possible options for the sound management of waste .  
Taking into account the progress already made in international and subregional cooperation and coordination to make the most effective use of existing facilities , it should be noted that the major constraints for small island developing States are not so much the lack of scientific knowledge and technology as the shortage of financial and human resources more specifically , the lack of a critical mass of qualified scientists and associated institutions .  
Provide financial and institutional support for research on safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods and technologies for the reproductive and sexual health of women and men , including more safe , effective , affordable and acceptable methods for the regulation of fertility , including natural family planning for both sexes , methods to protect against HIV AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases and simple and inexpensive methods of diagnosing such diseases , among others . . . .  
While military observers and most of the international civilian staff left the mission area by 30 September 1997 as scheduled , owing to the unforeseen scope and complexity of residual administrative tasks involving , inter alia , the re-creation of the Missions financial records lost during hostilities in April 1996 , the Missions in situ liquidation was extended until 28 February 1998 , with a small liquidation team continuing work at United Nations Headquarters until 30 June 1998 .  
That contracting authorities interested in developing a privately financed infrastructure projects , within their sphere of competence conduct a preliminary assessment of its feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility , as well as the environmental impact of the project ;  
One important measure to ensure the successful implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects is the requirement that the relevant governmental agency conduct a preliminary assessment of the projects feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility and the environmental impact of the project .  
Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote the role and capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries within the framework of a dialogue between the private and the public sector .  
Noting that the ongoing international financial crisis is adding further burdens to the external debt problems of many developing countries and that a number of developing countries have continued to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion , despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
A further review during the past six months has focused on bringing UNFICYP into line with the approaches in more recently established peacekeeping missions , while achieving additional efficiencies by integrating civilian and military personnel in terms of sharing responsibilities and decision-making , establishing more transparency and better financial control .  
States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements on material and logistical assistance , taking into consideration the financial arrangements necessary for the means of international cooperation provided for by the present Convention to be effective and for the prevention and control of transnational organized crime .  
But the socio-political burdens , the persistence of an apartheid culture which can not be transformed quickly , limited financial resources and still inadequate human resources constitute a considerable hindrance , not to mention the need to take account of the time factor , with South Africans impatient to taste the fruits of freedom even though the quiet revolution under way dates back only to 1994 . 
The world economic situation would be more equitable if capital flows were regulated and the unsustainable external debt of the highly indebted poor countries cancelled , and if a start was made on the democratic reform of international financial and trade institutions .  
Urges the specialized agencies , programmes and funds , including humanitarian organizations , and invites multilateral financial institutions , to include action against the world drug problem in their programming and planning processes , in order to ensure that the integral and balanced strategy which emerged from the special session devoted to countering the world drug problem together is being addressed ;  
During the period under review , a number of small island developing States in all regions have been affected by adverse economic developments which have impaired their financial capacity to implement even priority sustainable development measures.This is particularly true for the Pacific small island developing States , where a combination of internal and external factors have impinged adversely on their economic performance .  
The need for carrying out adjustment measures in some small island developing States , such as Cook Islands , Fiji , Papua New Guinea , Solomon Islands and Vanuatu , to correct economic imbalances rooted in the past , combined with the recent economic and financial crisis in Asia , have had both direct and indirect economic impacts affecting domestic output , prices of export commodities and export earnings , incomes from tourism and foreign investments .  
Participation in international and regional arrangements allows them to pursue mutually complementary objectives in a holistic manner and to benefit from the synergy generated , but it also burdens them with a multitude of obligations which further stretch their limited resources , both human and financial .  
General Assembly resolution 50-225 stated that the rapid pace and interdependence of global developments and their implications for all countries had led to a need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management .  
an improved dialogue on global economic and social policy issues in the Assembly and the Council , the identification of policy measures that should be adopted at the national and international levels to address such challenges and enhanced cooperation with the Bretton Woods institutions and other financial institutions ;  
ICSUs formal participation in the meetings and other activities of the Council is necessarily limited by its financial resources and the availability of suitable representatives , but the individual involvement of members of the scientific community globally and their expert contribution to the many issues addressed by the Council and its subsidiary bodies is substantial .  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the latest episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation do deteriorate further , and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Affirms that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily _ indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
In the light of the above , the Commission , at its third session ( 23-27 November 1998 ) , agreed to convene an expert meeting on the Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote SME development in developing countries .  
Having recognized that limited access to credit by SMEs is a major constraint on production and growth , many Governments directed public funds to SMEs through specialized financial institutions , such as agricultural and industrial development banks .  
There are also few successful examples of DFIs that have proven able to operate profitably with SMEs - among these , the Corporaci \ n Andina de Fomento ( CAF ) , a private multilateral financial institution which promotes sustainable development and regional integration by attracting capital resources for the provision of multiple financial services to the public and private sectors of the shareholding countries . 
This new policy should aim at the creation of more equitable and effective international economic structures in finance , trade and transfer of technology , as well as address the endemic problems of debt and transfer of resources , financial vulnerability , declining terms of trade in primary commodities , and restricted access to developed country markets .  
The Cologne initiative should be flexibly interpreted by the international financial institutions to the full benefit of all debtors without discrimination , and appropriate resources should be devoted to reduce considerably the stock of debt and its servicing , while bearing in mind that debt relief measures should safeguard social , economic and political stability in developing countries .  
In this connection , Ukraine underlines the importance of a more active and practical participation of the international financial institutions in providing additional financial assistance to the affected economies , and reiterates its earlier proposals to that effect , as contained in its position paper on the problems of implementation of the economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council ( see A 51-226 , annex-S 1996 595 , annex ) .  
The laundering of money accruing from illegal drug trafficking , and the use of such money in order to finance illegal activities , such as providing financial support for armed rebel movements that threatened legitimate Governments , posed a threat to international peace and security and made it essential for the international community to cooperate with the relevant international bodies . 
The unified international approach was the determining factor for making faster progress at local , national , regional and hemispheric levels because it was helping establish a common institutional framework for focusing efforts and enhancing the distribution and utilization of the human and financial resources involved .  
In that connection , the preparatory committee for the special session would need to address a number of issues , including foreign debt , the decline in official development assistance , factors impeding access to foreign markets and weak financial flows to countries in economic and political transition .  
Mr . Lhdesmki ( Finland ) , speaking on behalf of the European Union , the associated countries Bulgaria , Cyprus , the Czech Republic , Estonia , Hungary , Latvia , Lithuania , Malta , Poland , Romania , Slovakia and Slovenia , and , in addition , Iceland , said that the European Union had long supported the development of effective and responsive oversight , which was a critical tool for enhancing the efficiency of the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations . 
The debt-burden adjustment should also be maintained , since external debt was the main financial and budgetary constraint for many developing countries and , in some cases , had been aggravated by their stagnant or declining foreign exchange earnings .  
In order to ensure that the developing and emerging States derived the maximum economic benefit from the new arrangements , the Commissions legal standards and guidance must take careful note of international financial and capital markets and foster a willingness to modify existing national laws .  
With regard to possible future work on insolvency law , his delegation agreed with the view that strong insolvency and debtor-creditor regimes were important for preventing or limiting financial crises and promoting rapid and orderly recovery from excessive indebtedness .  
Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , with the assistance of the international community , especially donors , including through bilateral and multilateral financial support , should ensure that social safety nets are implemented , especially in those countries most affected by the recent global financial crisis , and ensure that they are adequately funded .  
Governments should improve the management and delivery of services for the growing urban agglomerations and put in place enabling legislative and administrative instruments and adequate financial resources to meet the needs of all citizens , especially the urban poor , internal migrants , older persons and the disabled .  
Special attention should be paid to the needs of Africa and the least developed countries , countries facing or suffering from emergency humanitarian situations and financial and economic crises , and those developing countries suffering from low commodity prices , as well as countries facing long-term and large-scale environmental problems .  
Calls upon the international community to address the deepening technological , financial and productive gaps between the developed and some developing countries , and among some developing countries themselves , as well as the widening inequalities between the rich and the poor ;  
Encourages the Government of Rwanda to seek the cooperation of Governments , international organizations and non governmental organizations to provide , within a mutually agreed framework of cooperation , the financial and technical support necessary for the reconstruction of a human rights infrastructure , including a strong civil society , in particular for the effective functioning of the National Human Rights Commission ;  
International cooperation to that end must be strengthened and the relevant international organizations must take concrete measures , such as technology transfer , financial support and scientific and technical training , in favour of the developing countries .  
In view of the inadequacy of available supplies of basic drugs and medical supplies , the Government of Iraq was requested , in a letter dated 12 October 1999 ( S 1999-1053 , annex I ) , to ensure that all measures were taken to procure and distribute all essential pharmaceuticals in a timely manner , especially given the favourable financial situation of the Programme .  
The report surveys all major properties at principal duty stations and regional commissions occupied by the United Nations , both owned and leased , since there are administrative and financial implications for facilities management and major maintenance under either occupancy condition .  
It is recalled that pursuant to Security Council resolution 1260 ( 1999 ) of 20 ( August 1999 , by which the Council authorized the provisional expansion of UNOMSIL , the Observer Missions original budget for the 1999-2000 financial period ( A 53-454 Add . 1 ) had been revised to $ 34 , 382 , 400 gross ( $ 32 , 870 , 100 net ) ( see A 54-455 ) .  
Calls upon Member States to promote cooperation between the United Nations system and the civil society , through national volunteer corps , in order to strengthen the United Nations capacities for early and effective response to humanitarian emergencies , and invites them to make the commensurate financial resources available through the special financing window of the Special Voluntary Fund of the United Nations Volunteers ;  
Calls upon all Governments , and all relevant United Nations organizations , and multilateral and regional financial institutions to consider increasing allocations of financial resources for economic and technical cooperation among developing countries , and to strengthen funding modalities to promote South-South cooperation , such as triangular cooperation and private sector funding ;  
Furthermore , previous United Nations conferences had developed social rather than development agendas ; there could be no development agenda without full consideration of financial , monetary and trade issues at the national , international and systemic levels .  
There needed to be better coordination of the functions of existing multilateral organizations , bringing together the key international institutions and national authorities involved in preserving the stability of the financial sector and cooperating on policies to reduce systemic risk .  
Without a shared sense of social responsibility and urgency , little progress would be achieved ; on the other hand , the considerable financial , technological and information resources of the private sector , if applied with a sense of social responsibility , could contribute to the cause of human rights .  
Although that countrys claim that the Sudan was supporting the northern resistance army continued to lack credible evidence , there was ample proof that the United States Government was providing material and financial assistance to the southern Sudanese rebel movement .  
The legislative recommendations contained in the Guide are followed by notes offering an analytical introduction with references to financial , regulatory , legal , policy and other issues raised in the subject area .  
Moreover , the successful implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects typically requires various measures beyond the establishment of an appropriate legislative framework , such as adequate administrative structures and practices , organizational capability , technical expertise , appropriate human and financial resources and economic stability .  
It is obtained on the financial market primarily by means of loans extended to the project company by national or foreign commercial banks , typically using funds that originate from short - to medium-term deposits remunerated by those banks at floating interest rates .  
In addition to loans and guarantees extended by commercial banks and national or multilateral public financial institutions , in a number of cases public funds have been combined with private capital for financing new projects.Such public funds may originate from government income or sovereign borrowing .  
Many global and regional financial institutions and national development funding agencies have established guidelines or other requirements governing procurement with funds provided by them , which is typically reflected in their standard loan agreements ( see also chap .  
One important measure to ensure the successful implementation of privately financed infrastructure projects is the requirement that the relevant public authority conduct a preliminary assessment of the projects feasibility , including economic and financial aspects such as expected economic advantages of the project , estimated cost and potential revenue anticipated from the operation of the infrastructure facility and the environmental impact of the project .  
Calls upon the international financial institutions to ensure that in their development cooperation activities , the developing countries are not required to undertake obligations with regard to their development policies , strategies and programmes in trade and trade-related areas in excess or additional to those undertaken within the framework of rules agreed within the multilateral trading system ;  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasizing also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Calls for effective governance of globalization through democratization of international economic policy decision-making ; integrated consideration of trade , finance , technology transfer and developmental issues by the relevant international institutions ; and reform of the international financial architecture and , in this context , calls for close cooperation and coordination between the United Nations , the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization ;  
Calls upon the developed countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of the development of developing countries ;  
Calls for increased international cooperation to address the challenges of globalization through the enhanced participation of developing countries in the international economic policy decision-making process ; integrated consideration of trade , finance , technology transfer and development issues by the relevant international institutions ; and the continuation of a wide range of reforms of the international financial system ;  
Calls upon all countries , in particular the major developed economies , to enhance coherence among their financial , trade and development cooperation policies , with a view to creating an enabling international economic environment supportive of development , in particular of developing countries ;  
Recognizing that natural disasters constitute a major problem for development whose solution requires considerable resources and calls for efforts at the national level to be supplemented by international financial and technical assistance ,  
The opening of many countries to global financial markets has created situations in which Governments , at both local and national levels , have new access to opportunities to borrow , yet many of the officials concerned have little or no experience with the workings of financial markets and no accurate concept of their abilities to repay the loans.This has led to numerous cases of potential public default or bankruptcy .  
The continued imposition by international financial institutions upon some developing countries of policies for structural adjustment can have profoundly negative impacts on the poor and vulnerable .  
Guatemala supported the establishment of a special task force to define that partnership , and believed that it should be composed of a dozen or so representatives of the Secretariat and the administration of the World Bank and IMF and their respective intergovernmental agencies and should focus on studying the limits within which the multilateral financial institutions could participate in activities , on the understanding that the final decision lay with Member States . 
The more advanced developing countries had also been hit very hard by the financial crises and sudden massive outflows of capital , which had severely affected the real economy .  
Moreover , the financial crises appeared to be increasingly frequent and more severe and it was beginning to be understood that they were the result of the malfunctioning of international capital markets and that global action was needed to overcome them . 
The high-level intergovernmental event on financing for development should launch a process of releasing resources for development from all parts of the global economic system , including the economic and financial sectors , foreign direct investment , enhanced official development assistance , and the fulfilment of all the internationally agreed targets for development .  
Thus , cultural , political , economic and legal measures , including criminal justice , to prevent and fight corruption can not be divorced from broader processes of political democratization , economic and social development and reliability of financial and legal transactions .  
In the early 1990s , the future of UNITAR seemed bleak : heavy debt and financial crisis , total loss of credibility , demotivated staff leaving the organization , poor vision of the future , expensive and often extraneous programmes . 
Statements I , II and III contain financial results for all United Nations peacekeeping funds , which are broken down into three groups of related funds and consolidated into a grand total reflecting all individual peacekeeping accounts of the Organization . 
Funds received or pledges recorded as receivable , attributable to future financial periods and , therefore , not credited to the income account of the period reported on .  
In the interest of prudent financial management , up to one half of the value of conditional pledges from Governments and firm pledges made by organizations of established repute are recognized as income at the time the pledge is received .  
The global market environment poses enormous challenges , and there is an urgent need for supportive international policies that will ensure the financial systems efficient functioning .  
Here is a country relatively small in size , but in terms of social , economic , financial , cultural , technological and scientific achievements , the Republic of China on Taiwan is indeed a force to be reckoned with , a formidable powerhouse .  
Only through concerted and collective action on the part of the entire international community can we combat phenomena such as severe financial and economic crises , regional conflicts , international terrorism , organized crime and the illicit drug trade .  
We believe that global financial instability and volatility of capital flows pose serious problems for sustained economic development in developing countries ; therefore , urgent reforms in the international financial architecture must be undertaken .  
The fact that the number of people worldwide living in abject poverty has increased is a clear signal of the imbalances and bias in the current global financial and trading system .  
These include local and regional armed conflicts , growing indebtedness , rampant poverty , scarcity of financial resources , and the spread of dangerous diseases such as HIV / AIDS and malaria .  
They include improved market access , deep and broader debt relief , foreign direct investment and other capital inflows , and financial and technical support in the multilateral trading system .  
As we are aware , the financial situation of the continent is characterized by an enormous external debt , stagnant national savings , as well as declining official development assistance and weak private capital flows .  
It is instructive to conclude from it that the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed against Cuba is a unilateral action , whose extraterritorial effects have no validity in public international law .  
In those days of deep crisis , Pakistan extended moral , political , financial , technical and material support to the people of that country in defence of international law and morality as a sign of our solidarity with them in the hour of suffering .  
My delegation is equally concerned about the illegal and humiliating economic blockade that is being imposed on the Palestinian people , resulting in tremendous suffering and in financial losses amounting to several hundred-million dollars .  
The draft resolution is entitled Towards a strengthened and stable international financial architecture responsive to the priorities of growth and development , especially in developing countries , and to the promotion of economic and social equity .  
We believe that the international community and the countries of Africa first and foremost should help each other and provide financial , moral , material , intellectual and political resources to the Centre , whose work we consider beneficial .  
The Government , which has a minimal credit limit and is determined to abide by established budgetary norms , is making enormous financial sacrifices so as not to pass on the rising costs of petroleum products to the vulnerable segments of the population .  
It is indispensable to get acceptable conditions from the IMF and other international financial institutions in the transition period , which would at least partly alleviate the inevitable sharp cuts in the budgetary allowances for social care and education .  
This can be attained only through generous financial assistance from the industrialized world directed towards improving and enhancing weak infrastructures and augmenting national institutional capacities .  
Since most answers to environmental problems financial , technological and managerial lay with the private sector , the traditional focus on the intergovernmental process was no longer sufficient .  
A favourable and enabling investment climate which mobilizes FDI and domestic savings and channels them into productive investments also requires that the suppliers of capital have reliable , transparent and comparable financial information .  
At the national level , UNCTAD could contribute to sound domestic macroeconomic and financial policies , administrative reforms and continuing efforts to promote a stable and transparent national legal and regulatory framework favourable to development .

His delegation earnestly hoped that the question would be addressed during the current debate in a spirit of mutual accommodation and understanding , with the sole objective of ensuring a secure financial foundation for United Nations peacekeeping operations .  
In view of the vital role which peacekeeping operations played in a world plagued by regional and intraState conflicts , it was important to provide the financial , human and logistical resources needed for the effective fulfilment of their mandates .

It was therefore regrettable that the Institute was now mired in an acute financial crisis which might force it to close down unless it received substantial contributions from Member States , together with the assurance of sustained multiyear contributions .  
We are convinced that the extent of the current crisis requires a vigorous and systematic effort by the international community in mobilizing human , technical and financial resources to fight the HIV / AIDS pandemic .  
Alleviation of the adverse social , economic and political conditions that were at the root of the conflict required concerted global efforts to mobilize technical , human and financial resources .

Although the least developed countries had launched comprehensive economic and social reform programmes , their socioeconomic decline had continued and the gap between the level of their financial resources and their everincreasing needs was widening .  
It is therefore essential that new , concrete financial commitments be made by national Governments and also by bilateral and multilateral donors , including the World Bank and the regional development banks , by civil society and by foundations .  
The meeting also considered that the effective implementation of agreements required appropriate institutional arrangements at the national and regional levels as well as the financial and technical support of the international community .

The view was expressed that there is the need for developing countries to successfully manage the flows of foreign private capital at the national level in order to prevent financial distresses or crises while maximizing their benefits .  
The benefits derived from the mobilization of scarce financial resources via international capital flowing to the most productive uses have contributed to economic growth and increased standards of living in all regions of the world .  
The current practice in financial regulation and supervision is for the Bank of International Settlements ( BIS ) to formulate standards expected to be applied by national authorities , rather than to establish a global regulatory agency .  
The dynamic development of the financial system and the capital market demand reliable ground rules and strong regulatory frameworks in order to guarantee the stability of the relevant systems and the adequate protection of savers .  
Enhancing private capital flows for financing development : facilitating private flows , especially longer-term flows ; expanding foreign direct investment to a much larger number of developing countries , countries with economies in transition and sectors ; enhancing the development impact of investments of transnational corporations in developing countries ; improving measures in destination and source countries to reduce risks of excessive international financial volatility ; capacity-building and technical assistance .

Strengthening as well as widening and deepening of the financial sector , as one critical area for internationally supported technical assistance , including learning from diverse national experiences in savings mobilization and in the adequate provision of financial services to all segments of society , including women and the poor .  
For countries mainly indebted to private foreign creditors , a primary goal of solutions to debt-servicing crises is sustainable borrowing from international financial markets under normal terms of access .  
Apart from national economies , there is an urgent need to strengthen multilateral surveillance and monitoring of international financial markets , with special emphasis on short-term capital flows , and to strengthen early warning capacity and modalities to prevent future crises .  
Investment in conflict prevention should be seen as our premium for a secure future , a future insured against the costs of war financial , human and material a future assured of shared security instead of a shared burden .  
Finally , the increasing incidence and magnitude of natural disasters confirms the need for and importance of efficient coordination at all levels in disaster preparedness and emergency response ; information-sharing and early warning systems to mitigate the impact of natural disasters ; and , above all , a ready pool of resources , including financial resources that can be deployed and utilized immediately , thus minimizing human suffering .  
In addition to problems stemming from a process of structural and economic reforms in order to establish a basic framework for a market economy , the country was hit by the financial crisis in 1998 in the Russian Federation , a major trading partner , a serious drought and rising prices for imported energy , on which the country is heavily dependent .

In support of this affirmation , I should merely like to draw attention to the meeting to be held tomorrow , in a room adjoining this one , where the Economic and Social Council and the Bretton Woods institutions will come together to design a new worldwide financial architecture which will be based on the social issues which were stressed by our heads of State at the Millennium Summit , and not merely on economic and commercial profit .

They do not exempt international civil servants from observing local laws , nor do they provide an excuse for ignoring private legal or financial obligations .  
We think that the nature of the Panels report is in sharp contrast to that submitted to the Council in January , as it contains numerous recommendations , including coercive measures , which are the result of the Panels review of the basic forms of illegal exploitation of natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and of the collection of extensive data on the structures engaged in such exploitation and their financial , commercial and transport activities .  
It is imperative that the international community continue to provide technical and financial assistance and to assist the people of East Timor in creating an enabling environment for sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
Other actors , such as regional organizations , the international financial institutions and civil society , also have an important role to play in supporting the efforts of Member States to strengthen their capacity to respond to factors such as exclusion and inequality , which , if left unchecked , can spark violent confrontations .  
While all these measures are , from our point of view , extremely positive , given the difficult circumstances the country is going through and the prevalence of extreme poverty among its population , we unfortunately find that the international community is still hesitant in mobilizing the financial resources and other forms of assistance that the country requires to address the enormous challenges , which are only increasing day by day . 
As concerns the economic dimension , we fully endorse the priorities set by the Special Representative to hand over a balanced budget to the provisional self-government , to introduce modern financial management and to develop a Kosovo-wide public investment programme within the framework of the Kosovo consolidated budget .  
The Interlaken process focused on the practical and technical aspects involved in designing effective financial sanctions and ensuring their successful implementation .

Although we believe that the main responsibility for bridging this gap and implementing international rules aimed at protecting children in armed conflicts lies above all with national Governments , we are also fully convinced that the international community has an important role to play in providing the necessary technical and financial support to protect , reintegrate and psychologically rehabilitate children .

A report on the Plan of Action had analysed results in 12 areas , including obstacles faced and lessons learned , among them the unwillingness of certain parents to permit their daughters to have vocational or technical training ; the policy of privatizing of health services , which prevents early detection of disease ; the lack of proper records on violence against women ; strong patriarchal attitudes in society ; and the limited access to financial resources that impedes women from running for elected office .  
On the basis of the deliberations on expert submissions , experts identified a number of best practices in the application of HCMs ( such as providing accurate , up-to-date and high-quality information ; instituting regular home-host country exchanges ; promoting creative mechanisms to overcome cultural and linguistic gaps ; using interregional exchange forums ; providing financial assistance and investment insurance ; and agreements on investment protection and double taxation , market access and technology transfer , including support for host countries absorptive capacity ) that would increase their effectiveness .  
That the current status also reflects some shortcomings and failures : recurring conflicts , interruptions in democratic processes , genocide and massacres , serious violations of human rights , the persistence of behaviours hindering the development of a democratic culture , the lack of independence in certain institutions , and economic , financial and social constraints , which cause citizens to lose faith in democracy ;  
Content : Structural features of and trends in the financial system ; the role of capital flow vulnerability of developing countries in recent financial crises ; implications of external debt for the formulation of domestic and foreign economic policies ; the World Banks Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) and Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers ( PRSP ) initiatives ; the debate on the international financial architecture ; the coherence between the International Monetary Fund , the World Bank and the World Trade Organization ; and domestic and foreign sources of financing for development .

This required a continuing dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies and development agencies from developed countries .  
It would be unwise to suddenly replace a stable financial and budgetary system , which had evolved through experience and could be further improved , by another system based on untested assumptions and vague concepts which could be inappropriate for the United Nations .  
It should establish an ad hoc working group , accountable to the Secretary-General of the United Nations , to study conditions and criteria to be established for such volunteer work , based on practical experiences ; consider legal , administrative and financial modalities ; and formulate proposals with a view to creating a legal framework conducive to their implementation .  
As the UNDP Resident Representative in Malabo had informed the Minister in a letter dated 4 February 2000 , technical and financial assistance in connection with the elections was made conditional on a mission to evaluate the conditions in which the electoral process would take place as well as the existence of prior agreement on United Nations involvement throughout the electoral process and the unrestricted participation of candidates of all political parties .  
It was therefore necessary to support country programmes and integrated regional programmes , which enabled beneficiaries to obtain a more specific range of technical cooperation services , while themselves determining the fundamental direction of their economic development .  Implementation of those programmes could of course run into difficulties through a lack of resources , problems of evaluating results and demand that exceeded existing financial possibilities .  
Its contribution would , however , be more effective if the international economic environment was more propitious , with better distribution of foreign direct investment and private financial flows , market access , a lasting solution to the debt problem and enhanced levels of development finance .  
Governments had a key role to play in implementing policies aimed at promoting financial , social and economic stability , harnessing the benefits of globalization and promoting and protecting human rights at the national and international levels .  
While international efforts could create conducive conditions for economic development , the primary responsibility for a nations development lay with its Government and people , and discussions on financing growth the development should focus on how to help LDCs mobilize domestic financial resources and attract external resources .  
Financial liberalization , while implying a reduction of government control over capital flows and the distortions resulting therefrom , had also increased the potential for instability in cases of excessive indebtedness , inadequate maturity structures , unsustainable exchange rates , lack of management of external savings , or speculative behaviour of financial market participants .

The net unutilized balance of $ 211,700 under this heading was primarily attributable to lower than budgeted requirements under troop costs ( $ 295,900 ) owing to the earlier than anticipated repatriation of contingent personnel , as well as savings under the emplacement , rotation and repatriation of troops as a result of the non-utilization of funds for the repatriation of the medical unit personnel in the absence , during the financial period of a claim , from the Government concerned ( $ 62,800 ) .

The challenge ahead requires [ adequate ] [ new and additional ] financial resources , technology transfer , and , where appropriate , political will , as well as commitment to innovative ways of applying energy efficient , environmentally sound and cost-effective technologies and systems to all sectors of the economy .  
In the view of the delegation , this , independently of and alongside international financial assistance and technical cooperation , constituted the main source of genuine internal resources which were an important factor for the generation of economic and social development in developing countries .  
In particular , some delegations noted that market access for developing countries to developed country markets should be improved and the international financial system should be strengthened to prevent external crises and to provide a beneficial framework for developing countries to access long-term capital and technical assistance for development .  
Bearing in mind the existing efforts in this respect , it is necessary to enhance efforts at evaluating and addressing the impact of international economic issues such as international macro-economic decisions-making , debt burden , international trade , market access , functioning of international financial institutions , transfer of technology , bridging of the knowledge gap ( digital divide ) , impact of intellectual property regimes , fulfilment of international development commitments and migration issues on the enjoyment of human rights .

This inadmissible claim highly simplifies a complex historical and social matter ; it ignores the military and financial autonomy of the paramilitaries and the extremely clear and increasing instances of lethal acts of aggression against public servants .  
We stress that the major creditor countries should loosen their grip on the agenda for the reform of the international financial architecture ; they should accept that representation in existing multilateral financial institutions should become broader and more balanced and that meaningful participation by developing countries in the decision-making processes , as well as greater transparency in such processes , should be ensured .  
Additionally , it is recommended that the State party undertake further measures , including the allocation of adequate human and financial resources , to develop youth-friendly counselling , care and rehabilitation facilities for adolescents , especially girls , which would be accessible by them without parental consent ; in this regard , the Committee notes the development of Adolescent Health Corners at the regional level and recommends that the State party pursue its objective of establishing such facilities at the district level .  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) United Nations organizations are willing to cooperate ; ( b ) all parties concerned display the necessary political will ; ( c ) sufficient human and financial resources are available ; and ( d ) the economic and political situation of African countries is stable .

Many delegations noted the necessity of an adequate replenishment of the multilateral fund of the Montreal Protocol , and emphasized that the implementation of the Protocol and its amendments would be strengthened through provision of additional financial resources to the fund , along with sound and affordable alternatives to ozone-depleting substances .  
Many delegations called for increased international cooperation in financial and technology assistance in building capacity , education , training and raising public awareness , particularly in systematic observations of the Earths atmosphere and of the oceans and the land surface , including satellite data .  
Reasons for this disillusionment were seen as a lack of tangible benefits to developing countries from opening their economies ; economic losses and social dislocation in many developing countries caused by rapid financial and trade liberalization ; increasing inequalities of wealth and opportunities arising from globalization ; and the exacerbation of the global environmental situation .  
Some delegations stated that ODA could play a catalytic and complementary role in relation to private sector resource flows in achieving development objectives , including by assisting developing countries in strengthening their civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
It was noted that international development cooperation has a decisive role to play in enhancing the trade competitiveness of developing countries through the development , transfer and assimilation of technology ; promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises ; strengthening of financial systems ; development of highly qualified human resources ; and improvement of public school systems , especially in the areas of formal and non-formal vocational training . 
Elements of such an environment were considered to include sound macroeconomic policies , accountable and transparent governance , a sound domestic legal and regulatory framework , incentives for investment , the involvement of civil society in public decision-making and the strengthening of civil , political , economic and financial institutions .  
In 2000 , the review of the coordinated implementation of Agenda 21 concluded that difficulties faced by the United Nations system could be attributed to constraints such as lack of financial resources , inadequate institutional capacity , cumbersome reporting relationships and inconsistent decision-making by the governing bodies of United Nations agencies ( A / 55 / 78 , para .  58 ) .  
The international community should also assist the small developing economies to overcome their constraints , such as lack of financial , technical and human resources , in applying WTO consistent anti-dumping actions against injurious imports , including through institutional capacity-building , assistance in the elaboration of legislation and the setting up of investigation authorities .  
Emphasizing that the Action Plan also states that the international community , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system , in particular the United Nations International Drug Control Programme , multilateral financial institutions and regional development banks should assist States in combating illicit drug production by providing financial and technical assistance for alternative development ,  
Urges the international community , including regional organizations , to undertake a greater and more determined financial and technical cooperation effort to support and promote alternative development projects , drawn up as part of national programmes , on the basis of the principle of shared responsibility as a pillar of international cooperation in countering the world drug problem ;  
They are determined to eliminate forthwith restrictions other than those related to customs , together with administrative , technical , financial , monetary and quantitative restrictions , and to reduce progressively , as agreed , all charges and taxes and treat Arab commodities as national commodities in the wider sense .  
In the interests of enabling the League of Arab States to fulfil its mission , perform its tasks , implement its programmes and carry out its activities , the leaders charged the Secretary-General of the League with taking the necessary steps and proposing appropriate formulas for the reform of all financial , administrative and organizational aspects of the General Secretariat of the League with a view to restructuring it , enhancing its working methods and performance and enabling it to address national requirements and keep pace with new developments at the regional and international levels . 
In order not to stifle those potential economic benefits , that delegation stressed the need to ensure that the final texts of those instruments satisfied the requirements of financial markets to overcome existing commercial risks associated with financing of space projects .  
The Programme of Action seeks , with particular reference to national programmes of action , concrete ways and means to effectively arrest and reverse the continued socio-economic marginalization of LDCs , improve their share in international trade , foreign direct investment and other financial flows and create an enabling environment for them to be able to benefit from globalization and minimize adverse consequences thereof .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
Recognizes , while bearing in mind the existing efforts in this respect , the importance of evaluating the impact of international financial , economic , monetary and multilateral trading systems on the enjoyment of human rights , while noting that issues such as those listed below are obstacles to the full realization of the right to development :  
In addition , the attention of the Committee is drawn to General Assembly resolution 55 / 186 of , entitled Towards a strengthened and stable international financial architecture responsive to the priorities of growth and development , especially in developing countries , and to the promotion of economic and social equity , in paragraph 25 of which the Assembly requested that the resolution be made available to the Committee as an input to its work on the systemic issues contained in its preliminary substantive agenda . 
That required that the developed countries should give financial aid to the developing countries in order to fund their basic social services , and should therefore raise the level of official development assistance , as well as finding an adequate solution to the debt problem .  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation to deteriorate further and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated , on an equal footing and a consistent way , with the realization of the broader social development goals , taking into account the specific characteristics , conditions and needs of the debtor countries ;  
Emphasizes the important need for initiatives on foreign debt , in particular in the expanded Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the decision of the Paris Club to go beyond the Naples terms , to be extended , expedited , implemented completely and made more flexible , and at the same time notes with concern the rigidity of the eligibility criteria approved by the international creditor community in the context of those initiatives , which is becoming a source of greater concern in the light of the latest symptoms of the international financial crisis ;  
Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources , in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation , and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms , as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms , combating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Urges States , international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care , research and treatment of the population in the affected countries ;  
Also recommends that international financial institutions , regional , national and local housing financing institutions and other credit facilities promote the participation of women and take into account their views to remove discriminatory policies and practices , giving special consideration to single women and households headed by women , and that these institutions evaluate and measure progress to this end ;  
April 2001 , endorses the Commissions decision to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions for three years , and approves the Commissions request to the Secretary-General to provide the Special Rapporteur with an adequate and stable level of human , financial and material resources in order to enable her to continue to carry out her mandate effectively , including through country visits .  
The subprogramme is expected to achieve its objectives and expected accomplishments on the assumption that : ( a ) up-to-date and accurate economic and financial information and data at the country and regional levels is available ; ( b ) financial resources for technical cooperation programmes are sufficient ; and ( c ) political and security conditions in the Palestinian territory and region are favourable , and relevant data is available . 
Two main challenges in this respect , both for developing and developed countries , are to generally encourage greater flows of beneficial private investment into developing countries and countries with economies in transition ( volume ) , especially through the development and continuous amelioration of new and innovative financial instruments , and to direct these private financial flows to developing countries and countries with economies in transition , regions or sectors that do not yet benefit from such flows or are particularly dependent on external assistance ( distribution ) .  
Good governance , according to article 9 of the Cotonou agreement signed by all 77 ACP countries and the EU , implies a political and institutional environment that upholds human rights , democratic principles , the rule of law , and the transparent and accountable management of human , natural , economic and financial resources .  
Situation in least developed countries , small island developing States , landlocked developing countries and other vulnerable economies is more difficult due to inherent economic problems of poor resource base , low productivity and lack of financial institutions . 
Supporting the efforts of developing countries to create open economies , with adequately supervised and well regulated financial markets , strong economic institutions , and credible and transparent economic policy frameworks .  
To include all IPF / IFF proposals for action in the plan of action is perhaps neither feasible nor practical considering the short initial time-horizon of UNFF , as well as the limited financial , human , scientific and technical resources available for implementation .  
The provision of increased financial resources , inter alia , through innovative approaches , as well as technical assistance and transfer of environmentally sound technology at the international and national levels , was highlighted in the final report of IFF . 8 It was also stated that such support is particularly needed for capacity-building , and for creating participatory and innovative mechanisms for financing sustainable forest management . 
The programme of work aims at the adoption and implementation of an integrated and multidimensional strategy for the right to development , a significant enhancement of support for that right from relevant United Nations bodies and a significant increase in the recognition of economic , social and cultural rights as human rights and their integration into the strategies and programmes of international organizations , agencies and financial and developmental institutions .  
The Secretary-General remains cognizant of the fact that , in order to be held accountable for discharging their responsibilities , managers need to have authority and control over their human and financial resources , timely and accurate information about the status of the resources assigned to them and training , as required .  
The trust fund so established is open to voluntary financial contributions from States , intergovernmental organizations , regional economic integration organizations , national institutions and non-governmental organizations , as well as to natural and juridical persons .  
The General Assembly recommended that , at their high-level meeting , the Economic and Social Council and the Bretton Woods institutions consider the modalities needed to consolidate further a broader global agenda for a strengthened and stable international financial system that was responsive to the priorities of growth and development , in particular of developing countries , and to the promotion of economic and social equity in the global economy ( Assembly resolution 55 / 186 , para .  24 ) .  
Taking into account that the re-establishment of traditional sectors of the economy , such as manufacturing and tourism , requires considerable investments and given Montserrats limited financial resources , inadequate infrastructure facilities , including transportation arrangements , and reduced population size , the Government has proposed to examine the possibility of a greater involvement in service-oriented businesses based on information technology , financial services and telecommunications .  
Bearing in mind that the absolute amounts attained by the foreign debt and debt service of the developing nations indicate the persistent seriousness of this situation , that the episodes of financial crisis in Asia and other regions have caused this situation to deteriorate further and that the foreign debt burden is becoming increasingly unbearable for a considerable number of developing countries ,  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated , on an equal footing and a consistent way , with the realization of the broader social development goals , taking into account the specific characteristics , conditions and needs of the debtor countries ;  
Emphasizes the important need for initiatives on foreign debt , in particular in the expanded Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and the decision of the Paris Club to go beyond the Naples terms , to be extended , expedited , implemented completely and made more flexible , and at the same time notes with concern the rigidity of the eligibility criteria approved by the international creditor community in the context of those initiatives , which is becoming a source of greater concern in the light of the latest symptoms of the international financial crisis ;  
Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources , in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation , and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms , as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms , combating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
Urges States , international financial institutions and the private sector to take urgent measures to alleviate the debt problem of those developing countries particularly affected by the human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immune deficiency syndrome , so that more financial resources can be released and used for health care , research and treatment of the population in the affected countries ;  
Also recommends that international financial institutions , regional , national and local housing financing institutions and other credit facilities promote the participation of women and take into account their views to remove discriminatory policies and practices , giving special consideration to single women and households headed by women , and that these institutions evaluate and measure progress to this end ;  
Encourages States to cooperate , including through bilateral and multilateral technical cooperation and financial assistance , in the implementation of their obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child , including in the prevention of any activity contrary to the rights of the child and in the rehabilitation and social integration of the victims , such assistance and cooperation to be undertaken in consultation among concerned States and other relevant international organizations ; VIII .  
In order not to stifle those potential economic benefits , that delegation stressed the need to ensure that the final texts of those instruments satisfied the requirements of financial markets to overcome existing commercial risks associated with financing of space projects .  
It is important to ensure sustained availability and flexibility in the deployment and efficient use of adequate resources for technical assistance for capacity-building , through enhanced convergence of efforts of concerned United Nations system agencies , in partnership with key financial actors , public and private .  
National efforts to mobilize domestic financial resources should consolidate enabling domestic environments geared to promote growth with equity , through good governance , effective domestic institutions , the rule of law and sound macroeconomic , structural and social development policies that are gender - and environment-sensitive .  
Based on common international understandings that respect diversity and specific country circumstances , these national efforts should be supported by an enabling international environment , including good international financial and trade governance and adequate external resources mobilization .  
How to strengthen public-private partnerships , including through ODA leverage and the support of the international and regional financial institutions , to finance critical infrastructure projects and other priority development areas for developing countries and countries with economies in transition , not only by sharing risk with the private sector but also by improving awareness of business opportunities in these countries ?  
What kind of awareness-raising and specific policy coordination effort could major industrialized countries undertake to fulfil their special responsibility in ensuring that their macroeconomic policies , including exchange rate policies , take into account their effects in creating an international economic environment favourable to equitable growth and development , international financial stability and enhanced financial flows for development ? 
Request the operational programmes and agencies of the United Nations , financial and development institutions , in accordance with their mandates , to assign higher priority and provide more funding to projects in favour of indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities , in order to combat manifestations of racism , xenophobia and related intolerance and discrimination , and to include such vulnerable groups at the stage of the development and implementation of projects concerning them ;  
Urge States in their national efforts , and in cooperation with regional and international financial institutions , to promote the use of public investment and encourage private investment in order to eradicate poverty , particularly in those areas in which indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other ethnic , racial , cultural , religious and linguistic groups or minorities predominantly live ;  
The parliamentarians of the Republic of Belarus appeal to State parliaments and Governments , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , business , financial , scientific and religious circles , social movements and funds , representatives of the mass media , their compatriots and all peoples of goodwill not to forget that the people of Belarus have been living in an environmental disaster area for many decades and need active assistance from the world community . 
Such legislative , regulatory or administrative measures could include the use of authenticated end-user certificates , enhanced legal and enforcement measures , as appropriate , to control arms-brokering activities , requirements to ensure that no retransfer of small arms and light weapons takes place without prior authorization of the original supplier State , and cooperation in the exchange of information on suspect financial activities .  
Bilateral , regional and global assistance ( financial and technical aid ) to States in the area of record-keeping , weapons collection and controlling and destroying illicit surplus small arms and light weapons will improve State capacity and help reduce the circulation and excessive accumulation of this weaponry .  
The MYFF is designed to strengthen the Funds contribution to addressing the challenges faced by countries in the implementation of the ICPD Programme of Action and the key actions endorsed at the ICPD + 5 review and to help secure increasing , predictable and stable financial resources to implement programmes .  
Targeted effects : ( a ) helping to relaunch agro-land reform ; ( b ) helping to establish integrated and participatory management of catchment areas for a better use of space ; ( c ) contributing to the development of ( traditional and modern ) bio-food networks and to alternative energy production ; ( d ) facilitating access by vulnerable groups , particularly women , to private and public rural financial services ; ( e ) capacity-building in the area of State planning and monitoring-evaluation of rural development , food security and natural resources management .  
Notes with concern the late issuance of the report of the Board of Auditors on United Nations peacekeeping operations , 1 and requests the Board of Auditors and the Secretary-General to work together to implement ways to ensure its timely and simultaneous issuance in all six official languages of the United Nations , including streamlining the format and content of the report , as well as the related financial information contained in the performance reports .  
It is anticipated that more countries will be able to follow this positive lead in confirming increased contributions to regular resources for 2001 and beyond , thereby enabling UNDP to build on and start to harvest the financial dividend of the renewed political support to UNDP , within the context of MYFF .  
The aggregate income figure of $ 2.2-billion ( including funds from other sources ) masks the serious financial crisis that UNDP is facing in its regular resource base since regular and other resources are not interchangeable ; other resources represent earmarked contributions to specific themes , programmes and activities , and tend to be geographically concentrated , and are also not adhered to the programme priorities identified by the UNDP Executive Board .  
It will be extremely important to maintain high-level involvement , to translate the momentum created by the success of the UNDP ministerial meeting into a sustained process of engagement at the political level around MYFF that ensures the concrete rebuilding of political and financial support for a strong role for the United Nations in development in general and for a better funded UNDP .  
Faced with the continuing low price of wool , the Department of Agriculture is endeavouring to encourage agricultural diversification , while programmes related to wool production and marketing continue to be a major focus , among them the Agricultural Subsistence and Incentive Scheme , designed to provide financial support and to assist in the improvement of existing farming operations or the development of new farm-based enterprises and the Pasture Improvement Programme .  
In addition , public sector performance also depends on ( i ) appropriate sectoral policies in key social areas such as health and education ; ( ii ) productive capacity enhancement , depending on a vibrant financial sector ; and ( iii ) the streamlining of legal and regulatory frameworks .  
An important conclusion that could be drawn from the situation and the corresponding financial responses of the Advisory Committee and the Fifth Committee was that the budgetary mechanisms and procedures that the General Assembly had established in resolution 49 / 233 A had proven to be practical , flexible and durable .  
As indicated above , ACC continued to deepen its shared understanding of the synergies that have to be fostered among the different dimensions of globalization ( financial , economic , social , cultural , technological and human rights ) , so as to strengthen the knowledge base required for the development of integrated approaches that can serve to bridge the growing divides that globalization is bringing about in many areas , and to spread the benefits of globalization to all .  
The report addressed the following areas : mobilizing domestic financial resources for development ; mobilizing international resources for development : foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and other private flows ; trade ; increasing international financial cooperation for development through , inter alia , ODA ; debt ; and addressing systemic issues : enhancing the coherence and consistency of the international monetary , financial and trading systems in support of development .  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone until payment is effected .  2 .  In addition :  
Stresses the need for a substantial international presence in East Timor after independence , and requests the Secretary-General to make detailed recommendations in this regard to the Council within six months of the adoption of this resolution , which should be developed in close consultation with the East Timorese people and in coordination with other relevant international and bilateral actors , in particular the international financial institutions and the United Nations funds and programmes ;  
Noting that the effective functioning of national TCDC focal points and the full utilization of the TCDC modality , require , inter alia , adequate financial and human resources , as well as international support ,  
Decides also that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force , their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 324,900 dollars gross ( 297,700 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 2000 shall be set off against their outstanding obligations in accordance with the scheme set out in paragraph 18 above ;  
Decides further that , for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Transitional Administration , their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 57,990,000 dollars gross ( 53,116,100 dollars net ) in respect of the period ending 30 June 2000 shall be set off against their outstanding obligations in accordance with the scheme set out in paragraph 19 above ;  
At the end of the twelve-month period provided for in financial regulation 4.3 , any unliquidated obligations of the financial period in question relating to goods supplied and services rendered by Governments for which claims have been received or which are covered by established reimbursement rates shall be transferred to accounts payable ; such accounts shall remain recorded in the Special Account for the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor until payment is effected . 
With a view to achieving sustainable development of production , the agreements established the need for legal , institutional and financial reforms in order to consolidate a democratic , inclusive , decentralized and participatory State .  
Although it was reported at the end of December 2000 that the Executive Director had delegated programme managerial responsibilities to ODCCP programme managers and that they would be held accountable for the implementation of programme activities and the efficient use of human and financial resources , at the time of the inspection OIOS found no documentary evidence specifying the parameters of such delegation and the mechanism of accountability .  
It also fully supported the Boards recommendation in paragraph 27 of its report that the Administration should implement procedures to ensure that rule 104.1 of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations , which required obligations to be supported by appropriate obligating documents , was adhered to and also to ensure that obligations were raised in the correct financial period against the appropriate budgeted amounts , since raising obligations without valid supporting documentation created a potential for fraud .  
Notes with concern the late issuance of the financial report and audited financial statements for the twelve-month period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 and the report of the Board of Auditors on United Nations peacekeeping operations , 2 and requests the Board of Auditors and the Secretary-General to work together to implement ways to ensure its timely and simultaneous issuance in all six official languages of the United Nations , including streamlining the format and content of the report as well as the related financial information contained in the performance reports .  
Declining availability of financial resources , domestic and external , including ODA , a heavy and unsustainable debt burden , falling or volatile commodity prices , complex trade barriers , lack of economic and export diversification and market access for key products which LDCs benefit from , as well as supply-side constraints , have seriously affected the growth and development prospects of LDCs .  
The Programme of Action seeks , with particular reference to national programmes of action , concrete ways and means to effectively arrest and reverse the continued socio-economic marginalization of LDCs , improve their share in international trade , foreign direct investment and other financial flows and create an enabling environment for them to be able to benefit from globalization and minimize adverse consequences thereof .  
Among these constraints are low productivity ; insufficient financial resources ; inadequate physical and social infrastructure ; lack of skilled human resources ; degradation of the environment ; weak institutional capacities , including trade support services , in both public and private sectors ; low technological capacity ; lack of an enabling environment to support entrepreneurship and promote public and private partnership ; and lack of access of the poor , particularly women , to productive resources and services .  
We resolve to promote increased and equal access for all people to open , efficient , effective and appropriate housing finance , to support savings mechanisms in the informal sector , where appropriate , and to strengthen regulatory and legal frameworks and financial management capacity at all appropriate levels .  
Takes note of statements made by the elected representatives of the Territories concerned emphasizing their willingness to cooperate with all international efforts aimed at preventing abuse of the international financial system and to promote regulatory environments with highly selective licensing procedures , robust supervisory practices and well-established anti-money-laundering regimes ;  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
With the highest rates of infection occurring in the age group of those between 24 and 54 years old , the productive capacity of the country is being diminished simultaneously with greater demands on our meagre financial resources , both private and public , for increased spending on care and facilities for the victims and to mitigate the devastating social and economic consequences of the disease .  
In 2001 , OHCHR has also assisted the independent expert on human rights and extreme poverty in the preparation and conduct of her mission to Bolivia to assess the effectiveness of anti-poverty programmes and strategies by meeting with government officials , representatives of non-governmental organizations and poor peoples associations , as well as United Nations and international financial organizations in the country .  
Recognizing the fundamental importance of strengthening national , regional and subregional capacities to address and effectively combat HIV / AIDS and that this will require increased and sustained human , financial and technical resources through strengthened national action and cooperation and increased regional , subregional and international cooperation ;  
Within the present grouping of youth organizations , there is a further distinction between regional organizations with a large resource base , in particular from developed countries , and more loosely organized entities in need of substantial institutional and financial strengthening , often regional youth and student bodies from developing countries .  
Urges / invites Governments , the private sector and international [ financial ] institutions , [ particularly / including the World Bank and regional development banks ] , to promote participation by persons belonging to / members of all groups , including [ minority groups ] individuals and groups affected by or vulnerable to racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , in economic , cultural and social decision-making at all stages and levels [ in the development and implementation of poverty alleviation strategies , development projects , and trade and market assistance programmes ] ;  
Expressing its deep concern over the severity of humanitarian sufferings of affected civilian populations , the World Conference requests the relevant international institutions to continue rendering urgent financial and humanitarian assistance to populations expelled from their homes and calls for enabling refugees and internally displaced persons to return to their homes voluntarily , in safety and dignity ;  
Urges States and financial and development institutions to mitigate the negative effects of globalization by examining how their policies and practices affect indigenous peoples ; by ensuring that their policies and practices contribute to the eradication of racism through the participation of indigenous peoples in development projects in accordance with the principle of informed consent ; by democratizing international financial institutions ; by developing enforceable codes of conduct for transnational corporations ; and by consulting with indigenous peoples in any matter that may affect their physical , spiritual or cultural integrity ;  
The fact that General Assembly resolution 55 / 5 stated that the reduction of the maximum assessment rate should have no automatic implication for the specialized agencies merely confirmed that the latter enjoyed financial autonomy and that , in the case of UNIDO , the resolution did not prevail over the relevant provisions of the UNIDO Constitution , which in Article 15.2 stated that the scale of assessments should be based to the extent possible on the scale most recently employed by the United Nations .  
The Group was convinced that , in the current situation of limited financial resources , UNIDO should continue to enhance its potential for technical cooperation in environment-related activities by strengthening existing working relationships with other international organizations such as GEF and the Montreal Protocol .  
Takes note of statements made by the elected representatives of the Territories concerned emphasizing their willingness to cooperate with all international efforts aimed at preventing abuse of the international financial system and to promote regulatory environments with highly selective licensing procedures , robust supervisory practices and well-established anti-money-laundering regimes ;  
Noting that the Government of the Territory continues to have significant financial , budgetary and internal control problems and that the Territorys deficit and financial condition are compounded by the high demand for government services from the rapidly growing population , a limited economic and tax base and recent natural disasters ,  
The harm done to the Cuban people has been established before competent judicial authorities and abundantly documented in the reports submitted to the General Assembly each year by the Secretary-General under the item Necessity of ending the economic , commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba .  
Stressing the urgent necessity for international cooperation and assistance , including financial and technical assistance , as appropriate , to support and facilitate efforts at the local , national , regional and global levels to prevent , combat and eradicate the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects ,  
States undertake to cooperate and to ensure coordination , complementarity and synergy in efforts to deal with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects , at the global , regional , subregional and national levels , and to encourage the establishment and strengthening of cooperation and partnerships at all levels among international and intergovernmental organizations , and civil society , including non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
States , regional and subregional and international organizations , research centres , health and medical institutions , the United Nations system , international financial institutions and civil society are urged , as appropriate , to develop and support action-oriented research aimed at facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of the problems associated with the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects .  
The right to food is the right to have regular , permanent and unobstructed access , either directly or by means of financial purchases , to quantitatively and qualitatively adequate and sufficient food corresponding to the cultural traditions of the people to which the consumer belongs , and which ensures a physical and mental , individual and collective , fulfilling and dignified life free from anxiety .  
In its resolution 1338 ( 2001 ) of 31 January 2001 , the Security Council requested detailed recommendations for a substantial international presence in East Timor after independence , developed with the East Timorese people and in coordination with the other relevant international and bilateral actors , in particular the international financial institutions and the United Nations funds and programmes .

Urges Annex II Parties to provide financial and technological support for strengthening the capacity of developing country Parties identified in Article 4.8 and 4.9 of the Convention for improving efficiency in upstream and downstream activities relating to fossil fuels , taking into consideration the need to improve the environmental efficiency of these activities ;  
Article 1 of the Treaty establishing the Community refers to the establishment of an overall economic union based on the implementation of a strategy by means of development plans that are complementary to the national development plans of member States and that include investment in the agricultural , industrial , social and cultural fields and in energy , and it looks towards the financial future of the Community with every confidence . 
In light of the additional financial resources urgently required to enable countries to achieve the poverty reduction goal as well as the other Millennium development goals , the General Assembly may wish to urge Governments to continue to implement policies to enhance domestic financial resources further and to promote foreign direct investment and other private capital flows , and to put them to efficient use .  
The Council also held the fourth special high-level meeting with the Bretton Woods institutions on two themes : development financing , in particular poverty eradication , ODA and debt ; and a move forward to a development-friendly international financial system : public and private responsibility in the prevention of financial crisis .  
Though these figures are the result of a number of endogenous and exogenous factors , they are directly connected with globalization in that they reflect the gradual marginalization it has brought for the poorest countries , which lack the necessary commercial , financial and technological capacity to meet the requirements of global competition .  
To ensure that public resources have an impact on the living conditions of the target population , studies are being conducted in connection with the third phase of the integrated financial administration system ( Sistema Integrado de Administracin Financiera SIAF ) , which is responsible for preparing and executing the national budget .  The aim is to incorporate decentralized , autonomous and local entities into the system so as to enhance effectiveness and guarantee transparency in public administration .  
The Government of Mexico considers that the international agenda should envisage at least five goals : greater and more effective participation by developing countries in international economic decision-making ; a truly open multilateral trade system reflecting the development needs of all nations ; a new international financial architecture releasing resources for productive investment ; an effective prevention and response capacity to deal with international financial crises ; and sustainable and integrated worldwide economic growth .  
Globalization is a multifaceted phenomenon inclusive of trade liberalization , greater mobility of capital and increased financial flows , changes in labour demand , liberalization of labour markets and their growing flexibility , * changes in the process of production , changes in the role and function of the State , rapid diffusion of products and consumption patterns , more rapid diffusion of information and technology , new forms of governance and mechanisms of regulation , and the emergence of a global civil society .  
Governments , donors , non-governmental organizations and the private sector should develop specific assistance programmes and advisory services for the development of the economic skills of rural women in banking , modern trading and financial procedures , matching the requirements of the market economy .  
UNCTAD should promote establishment of linkages among all the stakeholders in the international market for construction services through continued dialogue between the relevant professional associations , multilateral financial institutions and bilateral and regional funding agencies , and development agencies from developed countries .  
The recommendations adopted had touched upon four main areas : ( i ) what actions must be undertaken by Governments themselves ; ( ii ) what international and regional financial organizations and bilateral donors might be invited to do ; ( iii ) what and how issues were to be addressed during the multilateral services negotiations ; ( iv ) and what further work by UNCTAD was necessary in this area .  
As per the respective Commission on Human Rights resolutions , Member States of the United Nations are encouraged to continue supporting the efforts of the Office in this area and to provide additional financial resources as part of their contributions to the programme of advisory services and technical assistance in the field of human rights .  
In its resolution 55 / 184 of 20 December 2000 , the General Assembly , noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of heavily indebted developing countries , requested the Secretary-General to provide the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session with a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , including , inter alia , those resulting from global financial instability .  
An outcome of increased volatility of international financial conditions and frequent crises in emerging markets is the tendency to build up reserves as a safeguard against a rapid exit of capital and speculative attack on currencies . 
FDI has become the single most important type of capital inflow to developing countries , accounting for about two thirds of all resource flows during the 1990s . 2 The fastest growth in all types of financial flows to developing countries and transition economies over the past decade was in portfolio equity investments , which rose sixfold to reach an annual average of more than $ 40-billion at the end of the decade . 
The nature of a debt problem may vary from acute balance-of-payments difficulties ( instances of illiquidity ) to longer-term structural , financial and resource transfer problems ( cases of insolvency ) . 13 The need for repeated reschedulings of official bilateral debts appears to be related to the fact that the Paris Club approach was originally designed to address liquidity problems hence the importance attached to the cut-off date in Paris Club agreements . 
It appears that an effective and viable strategy for private sector involvement in financial crises in emerging markets would be to combine voluntary mechanisms designed to facilitate debt restructuring with internationally sanctioned temporary standstills to be used when needed .  
She called on the international community to commit additional financial resources and technical assistance for capacity-building in the physical infrastructure as well as for making available improved services and harmonized processes between the landlocked and transit developing countries .  
The representative of Brazil stated that for Brazil , a transit country for Paraguay and Bolivia , needed concrete proposals for the creation of innovative financial instruments of the national , regional and international levels , by financial institutions operating in the region .  
The representative of Peru stated that for Peru , a transit country for Bolivian trade , there is a need to establish financial instruments at national , regional and international levels : international financial institutions could help through special and innovative programmes to support the development , improvement and maintenance of needed physical infrastructure .  
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law and systems reform process but greater financial and technical assistance is required to help landlocked and transit developing countries effectively implement their cooperative agreements and arrangements .  
While landlocked and transit developing countries bear the primary responsibility to implement measures designed to strengthen their cooperative and collaborative efforts , the international community , including financial and development institutions should provide more support to enable these countries to deal effectively with their transit transport problems and requirements .  
The international community , including donor countries and financial and development institutions should strengthen their support for national , bilateral and subregional infrastructure and transit transport projects and programmes , including through the provision of adequate financial and technical support to one-stop borders post , as well as through improving current financing modalities and introduction of new facilities , such as co-financing , bank-to-bank loans , guaranties .  
However , the report describes two major problems regarding the administrative organization of communes , towns or territories , in terms of urban planning , public works , roads and drainage , etc . : extremely high levels of centralization , depriving officials at the local level of any financial or material means to act ; and a dysfunctional dualism between the environmental protection and nature conservation aspects of government policy . 
Some of the countrys partners having expressed a desire to re-establish their cooperation programmes , the various sectoral programmes prepared with the financial and technical support of United Nations specialized agencies will serve as support documents for resource mobilization and / or dialogue meetings ( consultative groups , round tables , sectoral and thematic consultations ) as needed .  
Here a broad trend was evident : those instruments with a specific target ( such as environmental protection ) generally had an in-built mechanism of implementation , including financial provisions ( such as the Montreal Protocol ) , while those instruments dealing with transfer of technology as a broad objective often relied on national measures in developed country addressees for their successful implementation ( such as the TRIPS Agreement ( article 66.2 ) ) .  
Although by and large , these commitments are in the form of best endeavour , they mark a significant departure from the previous two programmes of action by clearly indicating complementary actions between least developed countries and their development partners in seven areas : fostering a people-centred policy framework ; good governance at national and international levels ; building human and institutional capacities ; building productive capacities to make globalization work for least developed countries ; enhancing the role of trade in development ; reducing vulnerability and protecting the environment ; and mobilizing financial resources .  
Development partners agreed to effectively implement the enhanced HIPC Initiative and provide adequate financial resources expeditiously for the speedy and full implementation of the enhanced HIPC Initiative , and provide new and additional resources necessary to fulfil the future financial requirements of the Enhanced HIPC Initiative , on the basis of fair and equitable burden-sharing .  
The shortfall has restricted the ability of UNMAS in certain areas , including the development of guidelines , standard operating procedures and tools for operational and financial management ; monitoring and evaluation of new and existing programmes and projects ; enhancement of information management tools and mechanisms ; full integration of new and existing technologies ; development of appropriate training and evaluation materials for troop-contributing countries ; and implementation of an emergency response plan and development of required supporting infrastructures .  
The incumbent will provide much-needed capacity to conduct reviews and analysis of management systems / practices ; to identify preventive measures while adopting best practices ; identify and recommend policy reviews and proposals for implementing revised policies and procedures ; provide guidance to directors of administration / chief administrative officers on matters of financial accountability and adequacy of appropriate management tools ; and oversee ongoing development of standardized reporting formats for field missions .  
Position required to address deficiencies in the level of resources dedicated to the Asia and Middle East region : provides support for the chief on financial management of peacekeeping offices in the Asia and Middle East region , actions day-to-day correspondence , monitors status of allotments reports , assists unit with general administrative and clerical functions , responsible for coordinating unit reporting exercises and compilation of information ( IMIS ) for analysis by the chief .  
Further phases are planned and the eventual decision support system will contain all tactical information required to support the planning assumptions for rapid mission deployment , mission liquidation and redeployment of assets , build-up and deployment of surplus assets , personnel and contingent placements and mobilization , military and civilian mobilization , and financial and administrative information to support budget planning and financial analyses ( $ 150,000 ) . 
Re-emphasizes that extreme poverty is a major issue to be addressed by Governments , civil society organizations and the organs and agencies of the United Nations system , including international trade and financial institutions , and in this context reaffirms that political commitment is a prerequisite for the eradication of poverty ;  
Decides to extend an invitation to participate in the Social Forum to non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council and other non-governmental organizations outside Geneva and particularly newly emerging actors in the South , such as smaller groups , grass-roots organizations , voluntary , youth associations , community organizations , trade unions and associations of workers , representatives of the private sector , United Nations agencies , the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , the regional economic commissions , international financial institutions and development agencies ;  
Invites United Nations bodies and specialized agencies , the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , the regional economic commissions , the international financial institutions , the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , special rapporteurs and independent experts , non-governmental organizations , scholars , trade unions and associations of workers to participate in and to submit studies to the Social Forum ;  
Decides to extend an invitation to participate in the Social Forum to non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council and other non-governmental organizations outside Geneva and particularly newly emerging actors in the South , such as smaller groups , grass-roots organizations , voluntary , youth associations , community organizations , trade unions and associations of workers , representatives of the private sector , United Nations agencies , the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , the regional economic commissions , international financial institutions and development agencies ;  
Invites United Nations bodies and specialized agencies , the relevant functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council , the regional economic commissions , the international financial institutions , the Committee on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights , special rapporteurs and independent experts , non-governmental organizations , scholars , trade unions and associations of workers to submit studies to the Social Forum ;  
In paragraph 19 of its resolution 55 / 186 , the General Assembly requested the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) to provide information on the work it has undertaken to support the promotion of long-term private financial flows , especially foreign direct investment , inter alia , through enhanced technical cooperation , to all developing countries as well as economies in transition , in particular the least developed countries and other developing countries with special difficulties in attracting private financial flows .  
The discussions had concentrated on three sets of issues : the need for and role of foreign capital in developing countries ; how to manage the capital account to limit the potential damage from the instability of international capital flows ; and the role of financial institutions , and the possible contribution of global standards and codes on governance , competition and transparency in promoting stability and growth .  
Reiterates its call to Member States to strengthen the capacity of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security and in this regard urges them to provide the necessary human , material and financial resources for timely and preventive measures including early warning , preventive diplomacy , preventive deployment , practical disarmament measures and peace-building as appropriate in each case ;  
Takes note with satisfaction of the continuing efforts of developing countries , particularly those in African countries , to combat malaria through the formulation of plans and strategies at the national , regional and continental levels , despite their limited financial , technical and human resources ;  
In real terms , that represented a negative growth of 3 per cent per annum , as the Agency faced an annual growth of 3.5 per cent in its clientele population driving a similar growth in staff and financial requirements , and an annual weighted average rate of inflation in the UNRWA area of operations at 4 per cent .  
The representative of Belgium , speaking on behalf of the European Union , said that the European Union considered technical cooperation to be at the centre of the operational activities of UNCTAD and thus encouraged all member States with the necessary financial means , and in particular developed countries , to contribute to those UNCTAD activities which were financed from extrabudgetary resources .  
Encourages the international donor community , relevant United Nations bodies and the private sector to provide support , including financial and technical support , for data collection and greater empirical research by Member States , particularly developing countries , and the relevant bodies of the United Nations system on the causes and patterns of migration , including on irregular migration and trafficking , as well as its social , economic and demographic impacts , and for documenting and disseminating information on successful migration management programmes ;  
The analytical potential of UNCTAD and its unique information base allowed member States to use the experience of developed and some advanced developing countries in structural reforms , privatization , stabilization of the financial system , approaches to indebtedness , effective use of financial and economic assistance , and regional economic integration .  
He drew attention to the continuing financial instability , especially in East Asia , and agreed with UNCTAD 's conclusion that the globalization of world financial markets had demonstrated the limits of multilateral financial institutions capacity to contribute to global financial stability , and that there was a need for fundamental reform of the international financial architecture .  
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law and systems reform process but greater financial and technical assistance is required to help landlocked and transit developing countries to effectively implement their cooperative agreements and arrangements .  
While landlocked and transit developing countries bear the primary responsibility to implement measures designed to strengthen their cooperative and collaborative efforts , the international community , including financial and development institutions , should provide more support to enable these countries to deal effectively with their transit transport problems and requirements .  
The international community , including donor countries and financial and development institutions , should strengthen its support for national , bilateral and subregional infrastructure and transit transport projects and programmes , including through the provision of adequate financial and technical support to one-stop border posts , as well as through improving current financing modalities and introduction of new facilities , such as co-financing , bank-to-bank loans , guaranties .  
The international community has played an important role in supporting the normative law reform processes ( drafting of laws ) , but greater financial and technical assistance would be required to help landlocked and transit developing countries to effectively implement their bilateral and regional agreements and arrangements .  
At the regional level three elements have been critical in energizing intergovernmental agreements and arrangements : ( a ) political and financial commitment by signatory Governments to follow through on agreed commitments ; ( b ) availability of government officials vested with technical capacity which enables them to formulate appropriate instruments and monitor and review progress in their implementation ; and ( c ) where the agreements involve many countries and a wide range of commitments , establishment of a permanent secretariat to coordinate implementation of such instruments .  
The Money Matters Institutes mission is to foster dialogue among leaders of financial services , international institutions and policy makers in developing countries to encourage the most realistic role for private capital in financing sustainable development , and to generate the requisite supporting data about emerging economies so as to facilitate this purpose .  
In the context of the international efforts being made to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and in light of the fact that countries that function as financial and banking centres have enacted laws on the laundering of the proceeds of illegal activities , the United Arab Emirates , after protracted study , has elaborated a draft law on money laundering that was approved by the Council of Ministers at its meeting held yesterday . 
On prospects for fundamental reform of the international financial architecture , the panellists said that enthusiasm had given way to the perception that it was virtually impossible to reach consensus on such reform , and that second-best solutions in the form of do-it-yourself approaches to crisis prevention and management at both the regional and national levels currently appeared to be the only politically feasible alternative .  
The panellists suggested that less reliance on private capital flows should be a common goal for all developing countries , because of ( i ) the volatility of such flows , ( ii ) the likelihood that financial flows to developing countries would decline in reaction to the less optimistic outlook for the global economy and to the falling profitability of FDI in major recipient countries , and ( iii ) the lack of meaningful international financial reforms .  
While bilateral cooperation , especially in regard to technical cooperation , remains a prevalent form of South-South cooperation , conscious efforts are being made by developing countries to pool their resources and capacities institutional , intellectual , technical and financial to address issues of common concern or specific development problems that affect a large number of people and countries .  
High rates of unemployment , in particular among young people , the non-functioning of the national safety net system , scarce opportunities for private investment , declining domestic production and other financial , cultural and criminal factors have contributed to political instability .  
The forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would be addressing the inequities inherent in the global economy and would bring together for the first time the United Nations , the Bretton Woods institutions , the private sector and civil society to consider how to reform the current financial system and find means of increasing cooperation to stimulate financial flows to the developing countries . 
Effective development strategies and economic and social sustainability depended on enhanced national capacity to operate within a comprehensive framework that reflected the interdependence of macroeconomic and financial issues with structural , social and human concerns , including environment and health . 
He stressed the importance of full implementation of Agenda 21 , especially the pledges made by the developed countries , based on the principle of joint and several responsibility , to provide financial resources to help developing countries fulfil their commitments and to transfer technology to them on a preferential basis and on easy terms .  
The forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would be instrumental in reshaping the world economic order and making it more equitable , by inter alia , coming up with a sustainable solution to the debt crisis and reforming the international financial architecture .  
Despite repeated calls for a change in the current international economic , trade and financial system , which did not meet the needs of the developing countries , especially those of the most vulnerable , no specific conclusions had yet been reached .  
Bridges should be built in the political , economic , financial , commercial , technical and social realm , and institutions should be strengthened at all levels , to facilitate such integration in a just and equitable process .  
In this framework , we also call for the discontinuation of all financial , technological and scientific aid used in developing Israels dangerous nuclear installations , which threaten not only the peace efforts and attempts to find a solution to the Palestine question and the Middle East problem , but also the security , stability and real interests of the peoples in the area and their natural , economic and environmental resources .  
First of all , an equitable international economic order should be established which did not blindly impose globalization on developing countries but instead included an equitable trading system , reform of the international financial institutions and a solution to the external debt problem .  
In its resolution 1338 ( 2001 ) , the Security Council requested detailed recommendations for a substantial international presence in East Timor after independence , developed in consultation with the East Timorese people and in coordination with the other relevant international and bilateral actors , in particular the international financial institutions and the United Nations funds and programmes .  
The Task Force is responsible for : ( a ) recommending initiatives or actions which will lead to the establishment of a common service or the reinforcement of an existing one ; ( b ) reviewing proposals and recommendations put forward by the working groups on common services ; and ( c ) defining the degree of commitment of cooperation , participation and human and financial resources required from participating organizations .  
The involvement of the League is expected to provide the needed political support to advance the objective of the UNDP regional programme on governance with emphasis on strengthening parliaments , supporting frameworks for financial transparency and accountability , improving the administration of justice and promoting human rights .  
Despite its own economic difficulties in the wake of the financial crisis in Asia , the Government had maintained its commitment to official development assistance ( ODA ) , which included cooperative programmes emphasizing local ownership and promoting human resources development in partnership with least developed countries . 
As stated earlier , with UNAMSIL currently being the largest peacekeeping operation , with projected human and material resources of over $ 700-million for the financial period 2001 / 02 , and in the light of the continued growth and complexity of the administrative and logistical support functions required of the Mission , it is of critical importance that the Director of Administration be a capable individual with a high level of competency and experience in meeting the progressively demanding administrative requirements of the Mission . 
As part of the rigid economic , financial and commercial blockade imposed on Cuba for more than 40 years , various actions have targeted our programme for the peaceful use of nuclear energy to prevent its advance .  
The ad hoc expert groups report ( A / 53 / 312 ) , including its conclusion that the global and regional financial institutions should play the lead role in assessing and addressing the economic consequences incurred by third States , had stimulated more focused thinking on the issues and , in particular , on the role of international organizations within and outside the United Nations system .  
On the subject of the environment and sustainable development , the Group of 77 and China were indeed pleased with the adoption at the first substantive session of the United Nations Forum on Forests of a multi-year programme of work and a plan of action .  They also wished to emphasize the necessity of providing the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification with adequate , predictable and stable financial resources .  
The problems created by globalization could provoke a genuine crisis of confidence among the worlds people as they saw poverty worsening , income unequally distributed within and among countries and international financial and commercial markets prey to instability at a time when the international community had never had such economic and technological means at its disposal .  
In addition to the loss of life and physical damage , international terrorism led to political instability , which was inimical to harmonious development of States , and made it necessary to devote huge human and financial resources to combating that scourge and eliminating its consequences .  
Emphasizes the need for technical and financial assistance to those developing countries working to achieve the elimination of traditional or customary practices affecting the health of women and girls from United Nations fund and programmes , international and regional financial institutions and bilateral and multilateral donors , as well as the need for assistance to non-governmental organizations and community-based groups active in this field from the international community ; 3 .  Calls upon all States :  
It was important to cooperate to find common solutions that would make it possible to reduce the vulnerability of the economies of the developing countries which was linked to the instability of external resources and inequitable access to private capital markets and to strengthen the world financial system so that it would serve the interests of all and lead to the attainment of the development goals established by the international community .  
The mobilization of additional resources , both domestic and foreign , was essential in order to achieve higher levels of growth and more effective poverty eradication ; private capital flows , and the promotion of trade , which would generate foreign capital , particularly in countries which had not been able to attract international financial flows , were equally important .  
It revealed , in particular , that without a coordinated global policy response , the slowing of the United States economy would produce a synchronous cyclical downturn in the world economy ; that on the eve of the events of 11 September , global economic conditions had already been deteriorating , and that for the first time since the end of the 1970s much of the world economy was simultaneously experiencing slower growth , because the major industrialized countries were exporting their recession through trade and financial linkages .  
While that view attracted some support , a concern was that mentioning governmental financial or economic support in a model legislative provision would be tantamount to recommending that support be given by the Government , a result that was considered inappropriate in respect of those Governments whose policy was not to grant any support for privately financed infrastructure projects .  
The view was expressed that model legislative provisions in respect of recommendations 46-48 should be drafted , since the issue of both collection of fees and other payments to be made to the concessionaire was crucial in respect of the financial balance of the project and the very notion of concession agreement and therefore needed to be addressed at a legislative rather than at a contractual level .  
He outlined the main activities undertaken by the secretariat , where priority continued to be given to least developed countries , and the progress achieved with regard to the utilization of developing countries capacities in the implementation of technical cooperation and with respect to the financial sustainability of selected technical cooperation programmes .  
The Committee sought clarification with regard to the procedures to be followed in respect of budgeting for additional support account requirements related to UNIFIL and was informed that it was the intention of the Secretary-General , on the basis of whatever decision the General Assembly might take regarding the additional resources under the support account for peacekeeping operations , to prorate the financing of the additional support account resources approved among the upcoming revised financial resolutions for the missions , whose updated budgets will be considered during the fifty-sixth session of the General Assembly . 
Calls upon all relevant United Nations organizations and multilateral institutions to consider increasing allocations of human , technical and financial resources for South-South cooperation and , in this context , welcomes decision 2001 / 2 , of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Population Fund , in which the Board requested the Administrator to consider reviewing , in the context of the successor programming arrangements , the allocation of additional resources for activities involving technical cooperation among developing countries ;  
International and regional organizations and the principal international and regional financial and development institutions are asked to evaluate the impact of their policies and programmes on the enjoyment of human rights , especially economic , social and cultural rights ;  
Technical assistance , like any other financial assistance , should concentrate on improving local , regional and national judicial systems and national bodies to monitor money-laundering and on establishing independent national entities to safeguard integrity in public management .  
Recognizing that , in addition to the general problems of development , small island developing States experience specific problems arising from their smallness , remoteness , geographical dispersion , vulnerability to natural disasters , fragile ecosystems , constraints on transport and communication , isolation from markets , vulnerability to exogenous economic and financial shocks , limited internal markets , lack of natural resources , limited fresh water supply , heavy dependence on imports and limited commodities , depletion of non-renewable resources and migration ,  
Unlike the industrial age , which had been structured around vertically integrated organizations with high costs of communications , information and transportation , the age of networking was structured around horizontal networks , with each organization focusing on competitive niches in order to obtain maximum political economic and financial advantage by making the right decisions at the right time . 
It could also include development of codes of conduct or ethics , an effective and impartial civil service , effective systems for financing political parties , establishment of independent oversight bodies , free and transparent media , transparent public procurement rules , effective regulation of financial systems , an independent judiciary and the effective implementation of the rule of law .  
Recognizing that , in addition to the general problems of development , small island developing States experience specific problems arising from their smallness , remoteness , geographical dispersion , vulnerability to natural disasters , fragile ecosystems , constraints on transport and communication , isolation from markets , vulnerability to exogenous economic and financial shocks , limited internal markets , lack of natural resources , limited fresh water supply , heavy dependence on imports and limited commodities , depletion of non-renewable resources and migration ,  
Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti is continuing to implement a structural adjustment programme , and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences , in particular the social consequences , of that adjustment policy , so that the country may achieve lasting economic results ,  
Reaffirms , as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration , 1 that success in meeting the objectives of development and poverty eradication depends , inter alia , on good governance within each country , and that it also depends on good governance at the international level , on transparency in the financial , monetary and trading systems and on commitment to an open , equitable , rule-based , predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial system ;  
Calls for the full , speedy and effective implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative , and , in this regard , stresses the need for the donor community to provide the additional resources necessary to fulfil the future financial requirements of the Initiative , hence welcomes the agreement that financing for heavily indebted poor countries should be reviewed analytically and separately from International Development Association replenishment requirements but back to back with meetings for the thirteenth replenishment of the Association , and calls upon all donors to participate fully in this process ;  
Encourages the international community , the United Nations system , the private sector and civil society to provide the necessary financial resources to assist national Governments in their efforts to meet the development targets and benchmarks agreed upon in the World Summit for Social Development , the Fourth World Conference on Women , the International Conference on Population and Development , the twenty-third and twenty-fourth special sessions of the General Assembly and other relevant United Nations conferences and summits ;  
Recalling that prevention , preparedness and contingency planning for emergencies at a global level depend , for the most part , on the strengthened local and national response capacities as well as on the availability of financial resources , both domestic and international , 1 .  Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General , [ 1 ] prepared in pursuance of its resolution 54 / 98 on the participation of volunteers , White Helmets , in activities of the United Nations in the field of humanitarian relief , rehabilitation and technical cooperation for development ;  
Calls upon Member States to promote the facilitation of cooperative actions between the United Nations system and the civil society , through national volunteer corps , in order to strengthen the United Nations capacities for early and effective response to humanitarian emergencies , and invites them to make the commensurate financial resources available through the special financing window of the Special Voluntary Fund of the United Nations Volunteers , or in coordination with it ;  
The context can not be viewed in isolation ; we must also consider the various related factors , such as the costly structural adjustments that we have been making to our economies in accordance with international financial requirements , the heavy foreign debt burden and the unequal conditions that persist in world trade , which have limited our steady development .  
Invites the international community to continue to provide technical and financial support to landlocked and transit developing countries to assist with effective implementation of their cooperation agreements and arrangements on transit transport , taking into account that many landlocked and transit developing countries have concluded bilateral and regional arrangements and are making efforts to implement them ;  
Invites Member States , members of the specialized agencies and United Nations observers , including , inter alia , landlocked and transit developing countries and donor countries , and international financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions to participate in the international ministerial meeting and its preparatory process ;  
With regard to resources devoted to activities aimed at upgrading skills in areas where women had a comparative advantage , participants stressed the importance of the international community designing and implementing technical and financial assistance programmes through meaningful consultations with representatives of womens organizations .  
Encourages the international community , the United Nations system , the private sector and civil society to provide the necessary financial resources to assist national Governments in their efforts to meet the development targets and benchmarks agreed upon at the World Summit for Social Development , the Fourth World Conference on Women , the International Conference on Population and Development , the twenty-third and twenty-fourth special sessions of the General Assembly and other relevant United Nations conferences and summits ;  
Recognizing that , in addition to the general problems of development , small island developing States experience specific problems arising from their smallness , remoteness , geographical dispersion , vulnerability to natural disasters , fragile ecosystems , constraints on transport and communication , isolation from markets , vulnerability to exogenous economic and financial shocks , limited internal markets , lack of natural resources , limited fresh water supply , heavy dependence on imports and limited commodities , depletion of non-renewable resources and migration ,  
Recognizing that , within the context of the challenges of development , small island developing States can experience specific problems arising from smallness , remoteness , geographical dispersion , vulnerability to natural disasters , fragile ecosystems , constraints on transport and communication , isolation from markets , vulnerability to exogenous economic and financial shocks , limited internal markets , lack of natural resources , limited freshwater supply , heavy dependence on imports and limited commodities , depletion of non-renewable resources and migration ,  
Reaffirms , as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration , 1 that success in meeting the objectives of development and poverty eradication depends , inter alia , on good governance within each country , and that it also depends on good governance at the international level , on transparency in the financial , monetary and trading systems and on commitment to an open , equitable , rule-based , predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial system ;  
Calls for the full , speedy and effective implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative , and , in this regard , stresses the need for the donor community to provide the additional resources necessary to fulfil the future financial requirements of the Initiative , hence welcomes the agreement that financing for heavily indebted poor countries should be reviewed analytically and separately from International Development Association replenishment requirements but immediately after meetings for the thirteenth replenishment of the Association , and calls upon all donors to participate fully in this process ;  
Further recognizing the need for African countries to continue their efforts to create a climate favourable to private sector development and foreign direct investment and also the commitment of African countries to using both human and financial resources more efficiently in the process of industrialization , and emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic initiatives and international support , inter alia , through enhanced official development assistance , investment guarantees , debt relief , as appropriate , and enhanced market access ,  
To recommend that the participants in the International Conference on the Financing of Development to be held in Monterrey , Mexico , in March 2002 , address the need to explore innovative and more effective mechanisms for financing the protection of national public goods that afford global benefits and that they propose means of linking the environmental dimension with countries fiscal policies in order to effectively incorporate financial sectors into the effort to achieve sustainable development goals .  
To call for steps to be taken at the Summit to be held in Johannesburg to foster the establishment of effective means of facilitating technology transfer and new approaches to production under more favourable conditions , in keeping with principle 9 of the Rio Declaration , based , in particular , on the establishment by developed countries of financial mechanisms and preferential forms of tax treatment .  
Recalling the Millennium Declaration , which recognizes the special needs and problems of landlocked developing countries and urges both bilateral and multilateral donors to increase financial and technical assistance to this group of countries to meet their special development needs and to help them overcome the impediments of geography by improving their transit transport systems ,  
Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene in 2003 , within existing resources for the biennium 2003-2004 , another meeting of governmental experts from landlocked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to serve as a preparatory committee for the international ministerial meeting referred to in paragraph 10 above in order to provide it with substantive preparation ;

Recognizing further the need for African countries to continue their efforts to create a climate favourable to private sector development and foreign direct investment and the commitment of African countries to using both human and financial resources more efficiently in the process of industrialization , and emphasizing the continuing need for the mobilization of adequate resources through domestic initiatives and international support , inter alia , through enhanced official development assistance , investment guarantees , debt relief , as appropriate , and enhanced market access ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to launch a comprehensive and proactive public information campaign with sufficient financial resources to raise global awareness of the World Summit on Sustainable Development while also building broad international support for the World Summit and its goals ;  
Reiterating that mutually supportive efforts at the national and international levels are imperative in the pursuit of sustainable development , which includes , inter alia , the provision of financial resources and the transfer of technology for the application of cost-effective energy and the wider use of environment friendly , renewable energies ,  
Calls upon all relevant United Nations organizations and multilateral institutions to consider increasing allocations of human , technical and financial resources for South-South cooperation and , in this context , welcomes decision 2001 / 2 , of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Population Fund , in which the Board requested the Administrator to consider reviewing , in the context of the successor programming arrangements , the allocation of additional resources for activities involving technical cooperation among developing countries ;  
Further recalling its resolutions 52 / 220 of 22 December 1997 , 53 / 242 of 28 July 1999 and 55 / 195 of 20 December 2000 , in which it requested the Secretary-General to consider further strengthening the Centre through the provision of requisite support and stable , adequate and predictable financial resources , including additional regular budget and human resources ,
