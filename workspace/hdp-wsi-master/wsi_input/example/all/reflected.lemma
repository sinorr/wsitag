Before being sworn in to office , President Chen had once put forth the idea of " fighting a decisive battle outside our territory .

Opinions from the NPC mainly include the tendency for the central budgetary planning to be late ; the rather rough contents and unspecific items in the budgets submitted to the NPC for deliberation ; and the failure to implement the system of unified budgetary planning and reporting by ministries , and these have really reflected the many problems and loopholes in the traditional budgetary planning method used in China .  
In reality , the increase of deficit this year is not the result of implementing a proactive financial policy , but is due to the change in the compilation of budget .  In the past , interests for national debts were not listed in the current central budget , but are listed in the central budget now and reflected in expenditures for this year .  On the surface , even though it appears to be a sharp increase in the deficit , it does not mean that China 's fiscal deficit is not aggravated .  
Moreover , as explained by Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng , China 's budget deficit is increased this year primarily because of a reform in the way the budget is prepared : The 74.9 billion yuan set aside to pay for the interest of treasury bonds , which should not be treated as central recurrent budgetary expenditure and should not be reflected in the budget deficits , is now so treated and reflected as current deficit .

As reflected in various localities , in the past , some enterprises with a fairly great number of retired workers had to assign a person to take charge of issuing pensions every month , and this wasted a lot of human and material resources .  After the implementation of socialized distribution of pensions , the management of retirees will be separated from enterprises ; the burdens of enterprises will be greatly reduced and their operational vitality will be noticeably strengthened .  
Li Peng , who is NPC chairman , has been very busy with his official duties .

The advanced character of the party should be eventually reflected from each party member 's specific words and deeds .  Only when each party member and cadre are strict with themselves , always place themselves under the supervision of party organizations and the masses , keep tempering and cultivating themselves in party spirit , raise their political consciousness and moral standards , and maintain strict standards in work , daily life , and social intercourse will they be able to ward off the corrosive influence and never become corrupt .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman commented that the sharp decline in retail sales in May 1998 reflected the further weakening in consumer sentiment upon renewed regional instability during the month .  May was marked by the occurrence of some negative events with particularly wide repercussions for the region including Hong Kong .

A number of District Council ( " DC " ) members have reflected to me that , subsequent to their complaints to the relevant government departments about local problems , such as gambling at public places , illegal on-street parking and illegal hawking , they or their offices had fallen victim to harassment .

The free , impressionistic side of Chinese painting is reflected in the way Peking opera simplifies and abstracts , mixing the real and the unreal to create a unique aesthetic synthesis . And Chinese painting 's meticulous brushwork is mirrored in Peking opera by the extreme concentration paid to every gesture and intonation . "  
Even more revealing are names reflecting status differences on earth : " emperor , " " crown prince , " " general . " Moreover , their locations reflected their status : the " Emperor of heaven " star sat unmoving in the center , while " family " and " close advisors " bodies circled round it .  
Decoration costs and rising rents were soon reflected in menu prices , and " sometimes their meals were more pricey than any ordinary restaurant . " Mr . Yang maintains that once beer parlors started charging stiff prices and had lost the advantage of novelty all the charm went out of them , their unique atmosphere evaporated and their business started tailing off .  
The lake , which covered 13 acres , was dug out completely by human labor , one stroke at a time .

The secluded pond is as flat as a mirror , and only rarely does a gust of cool wind passing through the woods wrinkle the white clouds and blue sky of the northern Taiwan summer day reflected on its surface .  
Turning to look at Chinese people 's inherited political mindset , there is implicit in it a " tacit spirit of harmonious coexistence . " This is reflected in the allocation of political representatives to each ethnic group , whereby harmonious coexistence and equal representation of the Chinese nation 's " five peoples " is striven for .  
The shadows cast by war are also reflected in the daily behavior of Chinese refugees from Vietnam . For example , they are used to life in the mountainous wilds , and even when a regular cooking range has been set up in their new billets , they simply leave it unused , for they prefer to pile up several slabs of stone for their cooking fire . And when food is distributed , they are not above snatching or hoarding for they are deadly afraid of not getting another meal .  
In colonized areas , the nostalgia felt by expatriates for their homeland reflected itself in a growing romanticism and meticulous concern for form , symbolism , and detailed embellishment in the external appearance of the buildings they constructed . This came to be known as the " Imperial " mode , a mode which became increasingly fashionable in European academic circles after the mid-19th century .  
The sound of gongs and drums gets nearer and nearer . We pass through a narrow lane , and a vision suddenly appears before our eyes , reflected in the light of fire - - a huge procession of people and horses . Some folks carry incense ; others are striking large gongs .

Chen Chuo-ming , head of the Changhua Normal University , says that in the Chinese tradition teachers were supposed to have been able to teach both the material and the man . Teachers trained for ten years , and after this hard labor and sacrifice , not only did they acquire knowledge , they acquired a strong character as well , and this was reflected in their essays and lessons . But modern training for professors creates researchers only specialized in one particular area .  
Furthermore , in the past Chinese would rarely consider questions from an anthropological perspective . Over the 5000 years of Chinese culture , what was regarded above all else , what was viewed as most magnificent , bold and righteous , was in fact far removed from a normal person 's way of living and values . After the May Fourth Movement , people reflected a lot on these problems .  
Yet Bo Yang , who was writing a column for the Independence Evening Post called " Dreaming from My Chair , " continued to launch his witty attacks on the government of that era , especially regarding the privileges enjoyed by the powerful and other unfair phenomena , holding that these reflected a dark streak deep within Chinese culture .

Their movements are sultry and mysterious-how easy it is to imagine a cat creeping stealthily atop a stone wall , cast in silhouette against a full moon . Their almond-shaped pupils , which change shape in shifting light , are eerie enough , without even considering that their eyes may give off a green luminescence ( from reflected light ) . And the screeches they make to attract mates , cutting through the night , are hair-raising .  
But looking only at the bilateral cross-strait relationship , there 's also a contradiction . On the one hand , despite occasional political dialogue , neither side has ever altered its basic position , and this is reflected in the fact that , in military affairs , each side sees the other as its most likely adversary . On the other hand , no matter how tense the situation gets between the two regimes , economic and social interaction between their citizens does not decline .  
It used to be that only the wealthy could buy fashionable items , and these reflected their social position . Now , however , Taiwan has a middle class , defined as that class which has ample economic means without being rich .

This is the background against which the expansive and ambitious literary style of the Han took shape . Writers wrote with the elegance of a Chu poem and the sophistry of a diplomat . In tackling a subject , they endeavored to integrate virtually every possibility and use every relevant term .

In Anhui Province there was Ouyang Xiu 's self-effacingly named Pavilion of the Drunk Old Gentleman , where the mind of the aforementioned gentleman was preoccupied with scenic wonders rather than the next drink .

Changes that saw the feminine ideal turn toward exalting the sickly and the sentimental , toward women who were fragile and refined , were also reflected in ideas about manly beauty .

Whether you are making a film or making glass , the creative process can easily make you tense and worried , and this is likely to be reflected in the way you get along with others . So other people often used to find me irritable or restless . It was not until a few years ago , when I produced a series of modern Buddha figures in glass , that I gained an entirely new insight .  
" National sovereignty " is reflected in a country 's ability to engage in diplomatic relations , but in this most critical area for national survival , Taiwan has long been suffering from PRC efforts to undercut Taiwan 's international status .

The growth of alternative medicine reflected " a gnawing dissatisfaction with conventional , or ' allopathic ' medicine . " For all Western medicine 's brilliant achievements , such as vaccines , penicillin and organ transplants , it also had some severe failings , and the one most complained about was the endless waiting for doctors who viewed one as a sore back , an inoperable tumor or a cardiac case , but never as a person .  
The risk of not having a place in the global disease warning network is reflected in Resolution 107 passed by the WHO Executive Board in 2001 , which reads in part : " The need for international cooperation on epidemic alert and response is greater today than ever before due to increased population movements , growth in international trade and biological products , changes in methods of food processing , and social and environmental changes . "  
The Qing dynasty term for Aboriginal peoples was fan [ �g f ] , which originally meant tracks left by the passing of a wild beast [ and is generally translated into English as " barbarian " ] .

Taiwan 's recording industry took off in the 1980s . Pop songs began to come in all flavors , and the old paradigm , in which a few representative songs reflected the sentiments of a given era , fell by the wayside . Instead , talented writers began producing music and lyrics for all kinds of emotionally charged events . Even the literary community got into the act , thereby raising the standard for this kind of song .  
Luo Ta-you penned the song 's music , including its simple , fluid melody . The lyrics , meanwhile , represented the collective effort of a group that included Luo , Lee Shou-chuan , Chang Ta-chun , Sylvia Chang , Chiu Fu-sheng , and Jan Hung-tze . The standard of artistry achieved in the song fully reflected the contributions of the writers , musicians , and media magnates who had played a part in its creation .

Providing a panoramic view of the government 's work , this over-15,000-character Government Work Report is composed of 10 parts which cover the political , economic , social , and cultural fields , with more than half of its space devoted to economy-related contents .

Opinions from the NPC mainly include the tendency for the central budgetary planning to be late ; the rather rough contents and unspecific items in the budgets submitted to the NPC for deliberation ; and the failure to implement the system of unified budgetary planning and reporting by ministries , and these have really reflected the many problems and loopholes in the traditional budgetary planning method used in China .  
In reality , the increase of deficit this year is not the result of implementing a proactive financial policy , but is due to the change in the compilation of budget .  In the past , interests for national debts were not listed in the current central budget , but are listed in the central budget now and reflected in expenditures for this year .  On the surface , even though it appears to be a sharp increase in the deficit , it does not mean that China 's fiscal deficit is not aggravated .  
Moreover , as explained by Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng , China 's budget deficit is increased this year primarily because of a reform in the way the budget is prepared : The 74.9 billion yuan set aside to pay for the interest of treasury bonds , which should not be treated as central recurrent budgetary expenditure and should not be reflected in the budget deficits , is now so treated and reflected as current deficit .  
Faced with the challenge of a new century , the fiscal budget announced yesterday farsightedly called for " taking advantage of global economic integration " and " firmly grasping excellent opportunities in the hinterland to open the door to prosperity " and this has reflected new thinking and a new style in a period of Hong Kong people ruling Hong Kong .

Although the troublemaking fans were small in number , the incident reflected the problems in organization , such as the lack of proper management , due vigilance , complete and painstaking precautions , and the essential management of soccer fans watching matches , and scant attention which was paid to a handful of lawbreakers taking the occasion to make trouble .  
As reflected in various localities , in the past , some enterprises with a fairly great number of retired workers had to assign a person to take charge of issuing pensions every month , and this wasted a lot of human and material resources .  After the implementation of socialized distribution of pensions , the management of retirees will be separated from enterprises ; the burdens of enterprises will be greatly reduced and their operational vitality will be noticeably strengthened .  
Li Peng , who is NPC chairman , has been very busy with his official duties .  Yet , he has been very earnest in striving to understand genetic engineering , the newest frontier of life sciences in the 21st century .

Since the founding of new China 50 years ago , particularly 20 years since China implemented the policy of reform and opening up , the broad mass of journalist workers have enthusiastically plunged into the great practice of socialist building and reform ; ardently spread Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory and the party 's line , principles , and policies ; truthfully reflected the Chinese people 's spiritual outlook of engaging in pioneering work ;

Although it is impossible to make a concrete judgment before the detailed rules for the implementation of the policy are promulgated , yet the fact that foreign and domestic investors compete with one another to trade B shares in the same markets and their profits and losses are inevitably reflected in the balance of international payments in foreign exchange shows that , after all , extremely important progress has been made even though we can not say that the free convertibility of renminbi is right under our noses . 
The deputies from Shanghai maintained in their deliberation that the current amendment work fits in with the requirements of China 's further opening up and economic globalization , and has reflected the continual deepening of the work to open to the outside world and to attract foreign funds , the continual perfection of the system , and the continual enhancement of understanding .  
Judged from what has been reflected by the grassroots , right now there are too many inspections , conferences , social etiquette , and functions of all kinds , and they are very time-consuming and high-class .

Indeed , people across the country are satisfied with the tremendous achievements made by the current government in developing the economy , improving the people 's livelihood and the democratic legal system , and opposing corruption and promoting clean government .

The Chinese Government banned Falungong in accordance with the law for the very purpose of safeguarding the fundamental interests of the broad masses of people .

The advanced character of the party should be eventually reflected from each party member 's specific words and deeds .  Only when each party member and cadre are strict with themselves , always place themselves under the supervision of party organizations and the masses , keep tempering and cultivating themselves in party spirit , raise their political consciousness and moral standards , and maintain strict standards in work , daily life , and social intercourse will they be able to ward off the corrosive influence and never become corrupt .  
A Government Secretariat spokesman commented that the sharp decline in retail sales in May 1998 reflected the further weakening in consumer sentiment upon renewed regional instability during the month .  May was marked by the occurrence of some negative events with particularly wide repercussions for the region including Hong Kong .

A number of District Council ( " DC " ) members have reflected to me that , subsequent to their complaints to the relevant government departments about local problems , such as gambling at public places , illegal on-street parking and illegal hawking , they or their offices had fallen victim to harassment .

The free , impressionistic side of Chinese painting is reflected in the way Peking opera simplifies and abstracts , mixing the real and the unreal to create a unique aesthetic synthesis . And Chinese painting 's meticulous brushwork is mirrored in Peking opera by the extreme concentration paid to every gesture and intonation . "  
Even more revealing are names reflecting status differences on earth : " emperor , " " crown prince , " " general . " Moreover , their locations reflected their status : the " Emperor of heaven " star sat unmoving in the center , while " family " and " close advisors " bodies circled round it .  
Decoration costs and rising rents were soon reflected in menu prices , and " sometimes their meals were more pricey than any ordinary restaurant . " Mr .

Turning to look at Chinese people 's inherited political mindset , there is implicit in it a " tacit spirit of harmonious coexistence . " This is reflected in the allocation of political representatives to each ethnic group , whereby harmonious coexistence and equal representation of the Chinese nation 's " five peoples " is striven for .  
The shadows cast by war are also reflected in the daily behavior of Chinese refugees from Vietnam . For example , they are used to life in the mountainous wilds , and even when a regular cooking range has been set up in their new billets , they simply leave it unused , for they prefer to pile up several slabs of stone for their cooking fire . And when food is distributed , they are not above snatching or hoarding for they are deadly afraid of not getting another meal .  
In colonized areas , the nostalgia felt by expatriates for their homeland reflected itself in a growing romanticism and meticulous concern for form , symbolism , and detailed embellishment in the external appearance of the buildings they constructed . This came to be known as the " Imperial " mode , a mode which became increasingly fashionable in European academic circles after the mid-19th century .  
The sound of gongs and drums gets nearer and nearer . We pass through a narrow lane , and a vision suddenly appears before our eyes , reflected in the light of fire - - a huge procession of people and horses . Some folks carry incense ; others are striking large gongs .

Chen Chuo-ming , head of the Changhua Normal University , says that in the Chinese tradition teachers were supposed to have been able to teach both the material and the man . Teachers trained for ten years , and after this hard labor and sacrifice , not only did they acquire knowledge , they acquired a strong character as well , and this was reflected in their essays and lessons . But modern training for professors creates researchers only specialized in one particular area .  
Furthermore , in the past Chinese would rarely consider questions from an anthropological perspective . Over the 5000 years of Chinese culture , what was regarded above all else , what was viewed as most magnificent , bold and righteous , was in fact far removed from a normal person 's way of living and values . After the May Fourth Movement , people reflected a lot on these problems .  
Yet Bo Yang , who was writing a column for the Independence Evening Post called " Dreaming from My Chair , " continued to launch his witty attacks on the government of that era , especially regarding the privileges enjoyed by the powerful and other unfair phenomena , holding that these reflected a dark streak deep within Chinese culture .

Their movements are sultry and mysterious-how easy it is to imagine a cat creeping stealthily atop a stone wall , cast in silhouette against a full moon . Their almond-shaped pupils , which change shape in shifting light , are eerie enough , without even considering that their eyes may give off a green luminescence ( from reflected light ) . And the screeches they make to attract mates , cutting through the night , are hair-raising .  
But looking only at the bilateral cross-strait relationship , there 's also a contradiction . On the one hand , despite occasional political dialogue , neither side has ever altered its basic position , and this is reflected in the fact that , in military affairs , each side sees the other as its most likely adversary . On the other hand , no matter how tense the situation gets between the two regimes , economic and social interaction between their citizens does not decline .  
It used to be that only the wealthy could buy fashionable items , and these reflected their social position . Now , however , Taiwan has a middle class , defined as that class which has ample economic means without being rich .

This is the background against which the expansive and ambitious literary style of the Han took shape . Writers wrote with the elegance of a Chu poem and the sophistry of a diplomat . In tackling a subject , they endeavored to integrate virtually every possibility and use every relevant term .

In Anhui Province there was Ouyang Xiu 's self-effacingly named Pavilion of the Drunk Old Gentleman , where the mind of the aforementioned gentleman was preoccupied with scenic wonders rather than the next drink .

Changes that saw the feminine ideal turn toward exalting the sickly and the sentimental , toward women who were fragile and refined , were also reflected in ideas about manly beauty .

Whether you are making a film or making glass , the creative process can easily make you tense and worried , and this is likely to be reflected in the way you get along with others . So other people often used to find me irritable or restless . It was not until a few years ago , when I produced a series of modern Buddha figures in glass , that I gained an entirely new insight .  
" National sovereignty " is reflected in a country 's ability to engage in diplomatic relations , but in this most critical area for national survival , Taiwan has long been suffering from PRC efforts to undercut Taiwan 's international status .

The risk of not having a place in the global disease warning network is reflected in Resolution 107 passed by the WHO Executive Board in 2001 , which reads in part : " The need for international cooperation on epidemic alert and response is greater today than ever before due to increased population movements , growth in international trade and biological products , changes in methods of food processing , and social and environmental changes . "  
The Qing dynasty term for Aboriginal peoples was fan [ �g f ] , which originally meant tracks left by the passing of a wild beast [ and is generally translated into English as " barbarian " ] .

Taiwan 's recording industry took off in the 1980s . Pop songs began to come in all flavors , and the old paradigm , in which a few representative songs reflected the sentiments of a given era , fell by the wayside . Instead , talented writers began producing music and lyrics for all kinds of emotionally charged events . Even the literary community got into the act , thereby raising the standard for this kind of song .  
Luo Ta-you penned the song 's music , including its simple , fluid melody . The lyrics , meanwhile , represented the collective effort of a group that included Luo , Lee Shou-chuan , Chang Ta-chun , Sylvia Chang , Chiu Fu-sheng , and Jan Hung-tze .
