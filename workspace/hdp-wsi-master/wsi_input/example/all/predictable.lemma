" We believe that a slight upward adjustment in the profits tax rate and the deeming assessable profits rate for certain royalties and licence fees payments will not hurt Hong Kong 's competitiveness , as investors continue to be attracted to Hong Kong to set up businesses because of our low , simple and predictable taxation regime , which will remain as one of the cornerstones of Hong Kong 's system , " Mr Ma said .  
Moreover , at the international level , prospects for achieving adequate , predictable , new and additional financial flows to developing countries for sustainable development are fraught with many challenges .  
Moreover , at the international level , there is no clear evidence as yet of the provision of adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , in particular to developing countries , for sustainable development .

It is equally important to realize that restructuring alone can not accomplish much in the area of socio-economic development without a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries , as called for in resolution 48 / 162 .  
In the face of rapid changes that threaten social fabric across the board , it is essential to promote a stable , predictable international economic environment that would be conducive to development efforts .

On the question of the funding of operational activities for development of the United Nations system , of particular importance to developing countries is , first , the new appeal for a substantial increase in resources for these activities on a predictable , continuous and assured basis and for intensified efforts to mobilize the political will to achieve this .  
My country calls on the international community to ensure an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system with the aim of achieving the complete integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the new international trading system .

Overall , ODA is observed as being rarely adequate and predictable : its preparatory procedures are often elaborate and time-consuming , and conditionalities have blocked , delayed or interrupted development assistance .  
Therefore , even if the formula percentage can be revised upwards sufficiently at this time to generate enough income for the support account to finance the estimated expenditure requirements for backstopping for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 , it is the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } conclusion that based on past experience it has been clearly demonstrated that the current funding methodology does not reflect the actual backstopping capacity required and does not provide an adequate and predictable annual level of resources to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters .  
The Secretary-General strongly believes that adoption of this approach would provide the Secretariat with the adequate , assured and predictable annual level of resources necessary to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters , which the current funding methodology and formula has not .

In other words , if the tax rules for various types of investment vehicles were not completely consistent , taxpayers could use derivatives to choose the tax treatment that they most desired ; moreover , achieving complete consistency was difficult if not impossible because various instruments differed in ways that were traditionally considered highly relevant to taxation , such as the predictable returns of a debt instrument versus the unpredictable returns on most equity investments . 
Also calls upon the international community to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including ( , as mutually agreed , ) on concessional and grant terms ;  
As is strongly reaffirmed in paragraph 5 of Assembly resolution 50 / 120 , the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 50 / 120 .  
Generally , many of the developing economies have carried out sustained domestic policy reforms and have sought to liberalize their trade policies by reducing direct State intervention in foreign trade transactions , removing controls on exports and creating predictable and transparent import policies .  
While it is the primary responsibility of the Government to mobilize resources for poverty eradication at the national level , the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , is recognized - as is the need to enhance the effectiveness , efficiency and impact of the activities of the United Nations system in the area of poverty eradication .  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;

It stressed the need to implement sound and stable macroeconomic , microeconomic and sectoral policies that encouraged broad-based , sustained economic growth and development , and called upon the international community to seek to mobilize additional financial resources that were both adequate and predictable to contribute to poverty eradication .  
Mobilizing adequate , timely and predictable financial resources , including new and additional funding from the Global Environment Facility of the agreed incremental costs of those activities concerning desertification that relate to its four focal areas , in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Instrument establishing the Global Environment Facility ;  
The issue of resources for operational activities , however , was particularly important because , in the view of her delegation , if resources could not be increased on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , the effectiveness of such activities would be seriously impaired , developing countries ' development programmes would be jeopardized and , in the long run , international development cooperation would be affected .  
Mr . GALVARRO ( Bolivia ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , emphasized the importance of operational activities for development as a fundamental factor in seconding the efforts of the developing countries and highlighted the necessity of increasing contributions to United Nations funds and programmes as a means of revitalizing international cooperation for development , in particular , the achievement by donor countries of the targets set for ODA and the provision of such resources on a continuing , timely , assured and predictable basis . 
The Committee also agreed with the Secretary-General 's view that efforts to ensure that the United Nations was equipped to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century depended on , above all , continuous , predictable and assured political and financial support from Member States .  
The Government has the power to establish the right macroeconomic environment , as well as a transparent , stable and predictable legal , regulatory and tax framework , and thus create favourable conditions for entrepreneurial and enterprise development .  By acting as a catalytic or intermediating agent , including through appropriate policies and a supportive business infrastructure , it can stimulate , facilitate or support the development of enterprises , particularly SMEs , and of inter-firm cooperation , both internally and with foreign firms .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .

The Commission calls upon Governments and the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and to use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including on concessional and grant terms .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and inadequate access to technologies may hinder implementation and compliance with international legal instruments .  
Also considering that in spite of the commitments made at Rio by the industrialized countries to facilitate transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries and to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , the progress has been very disappointing ,  
Strongly urge the developed countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance immediately ;  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development include : the creation and maintenance of stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law ; establishment of an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system ; and support for the weakest and most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
An open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system is a key element in fostering an enabling environment for development and is also essential for deepening the flow of technology and information around the world .  
To establish conditions that help the private sector to be competitive in the emerging global economy , the Governments of new or restored democracies should provide a predictable legal framework , control of corruption , high quality public service and a supportive environment .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 and 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 .  
There is a need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
The latter two documents reviewed the principal features of a number of funding modalities , ranging from assessed contributions to negotiated pledges , and offered recommendations aimed primarily at placing voluntary pledges on a more secure and predictable basis by offering ideas on : multi-year pledges ( or some early indication of intentions to possibly reduce contributions from current levels ) ; dealing with currency fluctuations ; and linking funding to programmes endorsed by the relevant governing body .  
Among those policy parameters was that funding : be voluntary ; be focused on core resources , originating essentially from official sources ; be multilateral and neutral and remain universally accessible ; produce stable , secure and predictable levels of funding linked to programme requirements of the funds and programmes ; and contain elements leading to more burden-sharing .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .

Countries are still a long way from attaining the objective of providing incentive measures to enhance local benefits from biodiversity , including establishing secure property or use rights ; providing education and relevant technologies ; providing compensation for damage to crops , livestock and other property damaged by wild animals / predators ; involving local communities in biodiversity management ; and providing endowment funds or other financial mechanisms that ensure predictable and secure sources of income , such as user fees , franchises , land-use taxes and bonds .  
The main objectives of chapter 33 of Agenda 21 are ( a ) to establish measures concerning financial resources and mechanisms for the implementation of Agenda 21 ; ( b ) to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable ; and ( c ) to seek the full use and continuing qualitative improvement of funding mechanisms to be utilized for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
In addition to being flexible , any new system of desirable ranges should meet a number of operational requirements ; such a system , inter alia , should produce predictable and verifiable results , be easy to administer and be transparent .  
Secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity and human resources , and adequate access to technology may promote the implementation of international legal instruments .  
Strongly reaffirms the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries ;  
In the interests of equity , binding commitments for non-Annex I Parties could not even be envisaged until agreement had been reached on a fair system of apportionment of emission limits , a globally agreed reduction pathway and a projected sustainable future emission level on an equitable basis , and until there was reliable and predictable financial provision for the acquisition and adaptation of sound technologies , know-how and production systems in developing countries .  
Further , in paragraph 5 of the same resolution , it strongly reaffirmed that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 .  
Investment ( domestic and foreign ) , capital inflows and access to foreign exchange are facilitated by a low and predictable rate of inflation , a sustainable fiscal deficit and a realistic exchange rate .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .

Strongly urge the industrialized countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources to meet their commitments under and the requirements of Agenda 21 and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent gross national product ( GNP ) as official development assistance immediately , and also to ensure that within that target 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of GNP is earmarked for least developed countries ;  
Given the state of the world economy , prospects remained uncertain , even though the international community had recognized the urgent need for a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable trading system .  
Under those circumstances , the international community has shown its recognition of the urgent need for the creation of a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system through the adoption of various resolutions and agreements at all levels . 
No real progress has been made to fund United Nations funds and programmes on a secure , predictable , assured and continuous basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries .  
Thirdly , the real capacity of the private sector to provide resources that were predictable , continuous , assured , universal , neutral and commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries had to be ascertained .  
The Special Committee had considered practical steps to ensure that future peacekeeping operations would have a sound logistical and predictable financial basis .  
More than simple assistance , the developing countries required the establishment of rules and procedures guaranteeing a multilateral trade system that was open , regulated , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable . 
However , to mobilize private investors , a legislative and regulatory framework will have to be established that is stable , predictable and transparent , making it possible for rational economic decisions to be taken .  
It had been pointed out in its biennial report for 19961997 that if the Programmes voice was to be loud enough to be heard above the clamour of unfettered economic growth and globalization it would need adequate , stable and predictable funding .  
The scale should remain predictable and stable and should continue to be based on real capacity to pay , as determined according to transparent procedures and adequate information on the economic situation of Member States .  
Some other critical elements include well-functioning legislative and judicial systems , respect for political , economic and social rights , an independent media , use of legal norms , and predictable rules for decision-making and conflict resolution .  
Strongly reaffirming the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ,  
It is imperative that we should not wait for the end of negotiations on a fissile material treaty , the duration of which is hardly predictable at this stage , to start considering the next steps pursuant to article VI and its corollary , that is , the third commitment in the Principles and objectives document , which foresees systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
The executive boards had accomplished a great deal in the area of funding strategies , but much remained to be done in order to ensure predictable , assured funding of activities within the United Nations mandate and of efforts to achieve the ambitious goals set at United Nations conferences and to meet the needs of developing countries .

In addition , many delegations expressed support for the new strategic focus on security of tenure and urban governance and voiced the hope that the revitalization of the Centre would facilitate attainment of an adequate and predictable financial base .

Other resources can not substitute for a sufficient , predictable and sound base in regular funding , as highlighted in the annual review of the financial situation , 1999 ( DP / 2000 / 29 ) .

No matter how valuable a particular item of property may be to a commercial enterprise , it will have little or no value to a creditor as collateral for a loan unless the creditor is able to obtain a security right in the property that has priority over other creditors and remains effective in insolvency proceedings and that is capable of being enforced by the creditor in a predictable and timely fashion .

First , where countries have established or are well on the way to establishing an enabling environment for sustainable development and poverty reduction , including effective public management systems , they can absorb a full range of enhanced assistance , including budget support and predictable long-term commitments , aimed at achieving major development goals .

The Secretary-General trusts that the additional information provided herein will allow the General Assembly to establish the minimum predictable annual level of support account resources needed to meet the backstopping requirements at Headquarters by endorsing , at its second resumed session , his proposals , 1 / which were based on the outcome of the comprehensive review .  
In other words , if the tax rules for various types of investment vehicles were not completely consistent , taxpayers could use derivatives to choose the tax treatment that they most desired ; moreover , achieving complete consistency was difficult if not impossible because various instruments differed in ways that were traditionally considered highly relevant to taxation , such as the predictable returns of a debt instrument versus the unpredictable returns on most equity investments . 
Also calls upon the international community to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including ( , as mutually agreed , ) on concessional and grant terms ;  
As is strongly reaffirmed in paragraph 5 of Assembly resolution 50 / 120 , the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 50 / 120 .  
Generally , many of the developing economies have carried out sustained domestic policy reforms and have sought to liberalize their trade policies by reducing direct State intervention in foreign trade transactions , removing controls on exports and creating predictable and transparent import policies .  
While it is the primary responsibility of the Government to mobilize resources for poverty eradication at the national level , the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , is recognized - as is the need to enhance the effectiveness , efficiency and impact of the activities of the United Nations system in the area of poverty eradication .  
Strongly reaffirms that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 , 48 / 162 , 50 / 120 and 50 / 227 ;  
It will also draw up specific programmes as follow-up to the decisions taken in Agenda 21 and the Commission on Sustainable Development regarding the provision of adequate and predictable new and additional financial resources to developing countries , and mechanisms for the transfer of technology to those countries , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed in paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 " .  
It stressed the need to implement sound and stable macroeconomic , microeconomic and sectoral policies that encouraged broad-based , sustained economic growth and development , and called upon the international community to seek to mobilize additional financial resources that were both adequate and predictable to contribute to poverty eradication .  
Mobilizing adequate , timely and predictable financial resources , including new and additional funding from the Global Environment Facility of the agreed incremental costs of those activities concerning desertification that relate to its four focal areas , in conformity with the relevant provisions of the Instrument establishing the Global Environment Facility ;  
The issue of resources for operational activities , however , was particularly important because , in the view of her delegation , if resources could not be increased on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , the effectiveness of such activities would be seriously impaired , developing countries ' development programmes would be jeopardized and , in the long run , international development cooperation would be affected .  
Mr . GALVARRO ( Bolivia ) , speaking on behalf of the Rio Group , emphasized the importance of operational activities for development as a fundamental factor in seconding the efforts of the developing countries and highlighted the necessity of increasing contributions to United Nations funds and programmes as a means of revitalizing international cooperation for development , in particular , the achievement by donor countries of the targets set for ODA and the provision of such resources on a continuing , timely , assured and predictable basis . 
The Committee also agreed with the Secretary-General 's view that efforts to ensure that the United Nations was equipped to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century depended on , above all , continuous , predictable and assured political and financial support from Member States .  
The Government has the power to establish the right macroeconomic environment , as well as a transparent , stable and predictable legal , regulatory and tax framework , and thus create favourable conditions for entrepreneurial and enterprise development .  By acting as a catalytic or intermediating agent , including through appropriate policies and a supportive business infrastructure , it can stimulate , facilitate or support the development of enterprises , particularly SMEs , and of inter-firm cooperation , both internally and with foreign firms .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .  
There is need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , which should be addressed urgently and expeditiously .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of relevant Assembly resolutions .  
While acknowledging the importance of national policies and measures in the development process , the Agenda for Development calls for action towards a dynamic and enabling international economic environment , including such aspects as an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system and the promotion of investment and the transfer of technology and knowledge .  
The Commission calls upon Governments and the international community to seek to mobilize new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in such a way as to maximize the availability of such resources and to use all available funding sources and mechanisms , inter alia , multilateral , bilateral and private sources , including on concessional and grant terms .  
The lack of secure , sustained and predictable financial resources , insufficient institutional capacity and human resources and inadequate access to technologies may hinder implementation and compliance with international legal instruments .  
Also considering that in spite of the commitments made at Rio by the industrialized countries to facilitate transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries and to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable , the progress has been very disappointing ,  
Strongly urge the developed countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product as official development assistance immediately ;  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development include : the creation and maintenance of stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and international law ; establishment of an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system ; and support for the weakest and most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
An open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system is a key element in fostering an enabling environment for development and is also essential for deepening the flow of technology and information around the world .  
To establish conditions that help the private sector to be competitive in the emerging global economy , the Governments of new or restored democracies should provide a predictable legal framework , control of corruption , high quality public service and a supportive environment .  
The efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of General Assembly resolutions 47 / 199 of 22 December 1992 and 48 / 162 of 20 December 1993 .  
There is a need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries .  
Implementation can be promoted by secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity , human resources and adequate access to technology .  
The latter two documents reviewed the principal features of a number of funding modalities , ranging from assessed contributions to negotiated pledges , and offered recommendations aimed primarily at placing voluntary pledges on a more secure and predictable basis by offering ideas on : multi-year pledges ( or some early indication of intentions to possibly reduce contributions from current levels ) ; dealing with currency fluctuations ; and linking funding to programmes endorsed by the relevant governing body .  
Among those policy parameters was that funding : be voluntary ; be focused on core resources , originating essentially from official sources ; be multilateral and neutral and remain universally accessible ; produce stable , secure and predictable levels of funding linked to programme requirements of the funds and programmes ; and contain elements leading to more burden-sharing .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .

Countries are still a long way from attaining the objective of providing incentive measures to enhance local benefits from biodiversity , including establishing secure property or use rights ; providing education and relevant technologies ; providing compensation for damage to crops , livestock and other property damaged by wild animals / predators ; involving local communities in biodiversity management ; and providing endowment funds or other financial mechanisms that ensure predictable and secure sources of income , such as user fees , franchises , land-use taxes and bonds .  
The main objectives of chapter 33 of Agenda 21 are ( a ) to establish measures concerning financial resources and mechanisms for the implementation of Agenda 21 ; ( b ) to provide new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable ; and ( c ) to seek the full use and continuing qualitative improvement of funding mechanisms to be utilized for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
In addition to being flexible , any new system of desirable ranges should meet a number of operational requirements ; such a system , inter alia , should produce predictable and verifiable results , be easy to administer and be transparent .  
Secure , sustained and predictable financial support , sufficient institutional capacity and human resources , and adequate access to technology may promote the implementation of international legal instruments .  
Strongly reaffirms the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of the developing countries ;  
In the interests of equity , binding commitments for non-Annex I Parties could not even be envisaged until agreement had been reached on a fair system of apportionment of emission limits , a globally agreed reduction pathway and a projected sustainable future emission level on an equitable basis , and until there was reliable and predictable financial provision for the acquisition and adaptation of sound technologies , know-how and production systems in developing countries .  
Further , in paragraph 5 of the same resolution , it strongly reaffirmed that the efficiency , effectiveness and impact of the operational activities of the United Nations system must be enhanced by , inter alia , a substantial increase in their funding on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries , as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47 / 199 and 48 / 162 .  
Investment ( domestic and foreign ) , capital inflows and access to foreign exchange are facilitated by a low and predictable rate of inflation , a sustainable fiscal deficit and a realistic exchange rate .  
This requires adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including on concessional and preferential terms as mutually agreed , and promoting fair and non-discriminatory trading arrangements .

Strongly urge the industrialized countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources to meet their commitments under and the requirements of Agenda 21 and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent gross national product ( GNP ) as official development assistance immediately , and also to ensure that within that target 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of GNP is earmarked for least developed countries ;  
Given the state of the world economy , prospects remained uncertain , even though the international community had recognized the urgent need for a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable trading system .  
Under those circumstances , the international community has shown its recognition of the urgent need for the creation of a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , a positive investment climate and an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system through the adoption of various resolutions and agreements at all levels .

The Special Committee had considered practical steps to ensure that future peacekeeping operations would have a sound logistical and predictable financial basis .  
More than simple assistance , the developing countries required the establishment of rules and procedures guaranteeing a multilateral trade system that was open , regulated , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable . 
However , to mobilize private investors , a legislative and regulatory framework will have to be established that is stable , predictable and transparent , making it possible for rational economic decisions to be taken .  
It had been pointed out in its biennial report for 19961997 that if the Programmes voice was to be loud enough to be heard above the clamour of unfettered economic growth and globalization it would need adequate , stable and predictable funding .  
The scale should remain predictable and stable and should continue to be based on real capacity to pay , as determined according to transparent procedures and adequate information on the economic situation of Member States .  
Some other critical elements include well-functioning legislative and judicial systems , respect for political , economic and social rights , an independent media , use of legal norms , and predictable rules for decision-making and conflict resolution .  
Strongly reaffirming the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable , continuous and assured basis , commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries ,  
It is imperative that we should not wait for the end of negotiations on a fissile material treaty , the duration of which is hardly predictable at this stage , to start considering the next steps pursuant to article VI and its corollary , that is , the third commitment in the Principles and objectives document , which foresees systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally , with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons .  
The executive boards had accomplished a great deal in the area of funding strategies , but much remained to be done in order to ensure predictable , assured funding of activities within the United Nations mandate and of efforts to achieve the ambitious goals set at United Nations conferences and to meet the needs of developing countries .

While considerable progress had been made towards the development of an open , non-discriminatory , secure , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system , much remained to be done ; his country , which was heavily dependent on foreign trade , had suffered greatly from the remaining inequities in the current system .  
Serious efforts should also be directed towards securing adequate market access for developing countries products , access to technology , stable exchange rates , reasonably low levels of interest rates and predictable and assured financial flows .  
Renews the commitment to uphold and strengthen an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trade system , which contributes to the economic and social advancement of all countries and peoples by promoting the liberalization and expansion of trade , employment and stability and by providing a framework for the conduct of international trade relations ;

Mr . Nejad Hosseinian ( Islamic Republic of Iran ) : In almost all United Nations resolutions and decisions on financial and commercial issues and related final declarations and conclusions of high-level meetings in this system , the critical need for an equitable , secure , non-discriminatory and predictable multilateral trading system has been emphasized .  
We must express , however , our deep concern that , while at the national level the small island developing States have seriously demonstrated their resolve to implement the Barbados Programme of Action , as they agreed to do five years ago , the adequate and predictable financial resources that the international community pledged to provide to support the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action have not been fully provided .  
Renews its commitment to uphold and strengthen an open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trade system , which contributes to the economic and social advancement of all countries and peoples by promoting the liberalization and expansion of trade , employment and stability and by providing a framework for the conduct of international trade relations ;

In addition , many delegations expressed support for the new strategic focus on security of tenure and urban governance and voiced the hope that the revitalization of the Centre would facilitate attainment of an adequate and predictable financial base .  
To that end , the currently unworkable international financial system should be converted into a rational and sound system , and the multilateral trading system should be reformed in order to make it equitable , secure , nondiscriminatory and predictable .  
Other resources can not substitute for a sufficient , predictable and sound base in regular funding , as highlighted in the annual review of the financial situation , 1999 ( DP / 2000 / 29 ) .  
The [ procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance ] [ compliance system ] shall be credible , fair , coherent , comprehensive , unified , effective , predictable , transparent and simple .  
The [ procedures and mechanisms relating to compliance ] [ compliance system ] shall be credible , fair , coherent , comprehensive , unified , effective , predictable , transparent and simple .

Recalling the recommendations from the Malm Ministerial Declaration 2 / that the 2002 World Summit should review the requirements for a greatly strengthened institutional structure for international environmental governance based on an assessment of future needs for an institutional architecture that has the capacity to effectively address wide-ranging environmental threats in a globalizing world , and that United Nations Environment Programmes role in this regard should be strengthened and its financial base broadened and made more predictable ,  
Your endorsement hopefully through a presidential statement of the need for the United Nations to remain fully committed through a predictable and dependable source of funding for the post-independence requirements of East Timor which perhaps more than any other country will be the child of the United Nations and of this Council will send a powerful , reassuring message to the people and to the Second Transitional Government , which has a huge challenge before it in the months ahead , as well as to the Constituent Assembly of East Timor .  
It stressed the need to do so in particular so that inter-agency arrangements for internally displaced persons are predictable , characterized by accountability within the United Nations system , universal in their application and equipped to meet the immense humanitarian challenge presented by the global crisis of internal displacement .  
The recognition of special and differential treatments in favour of developing countries and an open , rule-based , transparent , non-discriminatory and predictable multilateral trading system are essential factors for a healthy global economic system .

Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;  
On the contrary , it has been observed that secured creditors generally require only that the insolvency regime be sufficiently fair and predictable to instil in them the belief that their security rights , if properly created , will ultimately be enforceable against the collateral within a reasonable time frame , without excessive cost and without being subject to unanticipated competing claims .  
However , it has been observed that the existence of mechanisms that may affect a creditors ability to deal with its collateral will not generally deter a lender from extending credit as long as the lender can develop a sufficient degree of comfort that the insolvency laws will be enforced in a reasonably predictable and transparent manner , that the lender will be compensated in a fair way for the diminution in value of its collateral and that the lender will ultimately be able to realize upon its collateral within a reasonable period of time .  
No matter how valuable a particular item of property may be to a commercial enterprise , it will have little or no value to a creditor as collateral for a loan unless the creditor is able to obtain a security right in the property that has priority over other creditors and remains effective in insolvency proceedings and that is capable of being enforced by the creditor in a predictable and timely fashion .  
Reiterates that the permanent solution to the foreign debt problem lies in the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order based , inter alia , in open , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , predictable , transparent and multilateral rule-based international financial and trading systems , which guarantees the developing countries , inter alia , better market conditions and commodity prices , stabilization of exchange rates and interest rates , easier access to financial and capital markets , adequate flows of new financial resources and easier access to the technology of the developed countries ;

First , where countries have established or are well on the way to establishing an enabling environment for sustainable development and poverty reduction , including effective public management systems , they can absorb a full range of enhanced assistance , including budget support and predictable long-term commitments , aimed at achieving major development goals .  
There is no choice therefore but to condemn and demand the immediate repeal of laws of this kind adopted by the Government of the United States of America , such as the so-called Helms-Burton Act and the Torricelli Act , which are a direct attack on the enjoyment of human rights by the Cuban people , are incompatible with World Trade Organization ( WTO ) agreements and undermine ongoing efforts to make the multilateral trading system more equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable .
