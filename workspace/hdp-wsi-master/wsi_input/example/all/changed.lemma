The decline of Tai Fu Tai is still a myth , but even before the British lease of the New Territories , in 1898 , the life at Tai Fu Tai had changed to a more village-life style , and the Man descendants , the owner of the mansion , then engaged in practical but still prosperous occupations , possibly developing some industries , like the soya-bean production , possibly in the annexe .  The various village-type activities required a firm paving in front though some of this may have been present earlier .  
Appreciated not only for its succulent flavors , the watermelon was also eulogized by poets who called its cool green colors , " sweet jade . " Times have changed but a slice of watermelon is still a delicious way to beat the summer heat .  
Taiwan 's economic structure changed during the 1960 ' s from an agricultural to an industrial base , and its core industries have developed during the 1980 ' s from labor-intensive to capital - and technology-intensive ones . The future job market will require higher quality manpower , and the demand for technical personnel will grow ever larger .  
Since September 1984 , when the joint declaration was announced , the ships have continued to ply the harbor as busily as before ; the young people and Westerners continue to crowd the shopping district , with its windows full of tempting goods from around the world ; and the sound of mahjong continues to rise and fall from the upstairs tearooms . . . on the surface , nothing seems to have changed .  
The next day the crowds of people were replaced by piles of trash , and the sugary white beaches had changed color , littered with bits of exploded firecrackers that were impossible to clean up .  
However , the focus for everyone 's attention is usually on construction , production line workers , sales people , and basic level laborers . They ignore the " knowledge workers " of university or college level . ( In the ROC , college refers to a five-year technical school begun after middle school . ) The labor market has changed dramatically in the last two years , but this is particularly the case following the political and economic " lifting of martial law . "  
My main subject has always been the history of Buddhism in China and how it was changed by Chinese culture . I have also studied the history of the coming of Christianity to China during the late Ming and early Ch'ing , including how China received and transformed the influence and the Chinese reaction to it , such as the Taiping rebellion . That is the process that interests me most .  
It was only in the nineteenth century that foreign influence became so strong that things actually changed . The English and Europeans broke China open not for religious reasons but more for commercial and political reasons .  
What 's awful are the bombs through the telephone , the salvo of alarming rings expanding the battleground from the mailbox outside the door to the soft underbelly of the study , the silent movie changed to sensur-round sound , the imaginary enemy shooting with real bullets .  
With the influx of these high-level new immigrants , the image of Chinese Americans , who had been described as " smelling half of ginger and half of detergent " ( because many of them earned a living by running restaurants or laundries ) , changed completely overnight .  
Utensils recovered from tombs are often painted with scenes showing feasting , drinking , music and dancing . Quantities of paper objects such as gold ingots , houses and boats were always burnt for the dead to ensure that they would be wealthy in the next world . Our custom of wishing each other " good fortune " at Chinese New Year has never changed to this day .  
The " Civil Service Performance Review Law " which has just passed its third reading in the Legislative Yuan is sending a little " red envelope " to all government employees in time for the new year : The content of the civil service performance review bonus has been changed from " base pay " to " full pay . " This will almost double the original amount , making civil servants ' wallets once again a subject of after-dinner discussion .  
Yeh Ying-kun , former director of the Taipei Municipal Psychological Center , did a study in 1989 of psychological illnesses in the Taiwan area over the past thirty years . He discovered that though the incidence of schizophrenia has not changed , there has been an increase in psychosomatic disorders arising from interpersonal relations , confusion , fear and behavioral irregularities , leading to backaches , diarrhea , headaches , and so on .  
Soldiers came from the local brigade to set up a sunscreen , and the electricity company contributed the use of a cherry-pick for pruning the upper branches . Others who lent a hand included farmers , horticulturalists , specialists from the Dept . of Agriculture &amp; Forestry and the National Taiwan University 's department of plant pathology . The offending concrete was removed and the soil changed , with the result that old roots have begun to bud anew , and there seems to be hope for the survival of the tree .  
A schoolmate of mine who was put in a class for gifted students and then ranked low on several tests began to doubt her abilities , which she had always been praised for . She lost all her self - esteem , tested poorly into high school and later even dropped out . She changed completely for the worse . She became antisocial and terribly defensive , " she relates sadly . "  
The end of combat zone administration is not like simply cutting a watermelon in two - - one chop for a clean break with no complications . The regulations , personnel organization , administrative measures and so on that remain from over thirty years under the system of combat zone administration all have to be changed . So there are many areas where the military authorities and local government will have to work together in the future .  
It is as though our image of a Korea with high foreign debts , political turmoil and wife-beating machismo has not changed for over ten years , " says Jing Ker-yi , Korea expert at the Chung-hua Institution for Economic Research . " At present Korea has incredibly overtaken us in a number of industries . This includes their high-profile automobiles and domestic appliances . It 's not very easy for people to realize , but they have made startling achievements in petrochemicals , steel , upper and mid-stream primary products and components .  
Tali Rural Township is located between Taichung City and Chunghsing Village ( the provincial capital ) . Because recently a provincial highway has been forged through , and Taichung has already been developed exhaustively , a certain old farmer with two hectares of land here went in with someone to build houses after the zoning had been changed . He earned over NT $ 10 million in cash , and still has seven or eight apartments worth nearly NT $ 10 million each .  
But since social mores have changed , women no longer need guarantees to be elected to the Legislative Yuan , and have , like men , won with the largest number of votes in a given district ( Taiwan having multiple-member districts ) . After entering the Legislative Yuan , they have gone from a passive , " decorative " role to become bold , frank " women warriors " who have the courage to take responsibility for things . Their evolution deserves attention !  
In comparison with the United States , we are a society that has changed relatively more dramatically . Since retrocession , economic growth pulled by the locomotive of exports , universal education and the transformation of social and family structures have all caused a tremendous change in Taiwan 's industry . Relatively speaking . The populous generation born after the war did not have the obvious impact it did in America .  
Teeming with life , the river also had a remarkably active course - - which has changed from being bounded by steep U-shaped canyons to having a wide and shallow river bed . Ordinarily this process occurs over the course of thousands of years and can not be observed in a human lifetime .  
For me and many other overseas Chinese living here , Taipei is such a distant place that it 's hard to sense what it must be like , how it 's changed from quiet and tranquility to bustling crowds and prosperity . Life here is a matter of constantly doing our utmost to realize ourselves and raise our oppressed status . It 's just like that passage in " Chinese ?  
On the surface , Taiwan 's art market has had a very lively atmosphere since the auction was held . But plainly speaking , an Asian center for Chinese art is not the same as an Asian market for Chinese art . The intermediary role played by the auction houses and their commercial nature can not be changed .  
The midterm and final report cards they handed over were Komalan Opera , a Taiwanese opera that tells the story of how the Han Chinese and the Pingpu aborigines a century ago changed from opposition to mutual acceptance , and Walking Theater , a stage play that centers around the life of a veteran Pei Kuan opera performer and thus contains a large amount of traditional singing , reciting and acting .  
If earthworms could be raised in polluted soil , and then after a time moved out , even if the total amount of heavy metals in the environment was not changed , the land could be improved in this way , and the speed at which heavy metals are " passed on ' ' could be increased , thus lowering the recuperation time for the land .  
Before the discovery of the microscope , and before " ecological observation " became popular , when our ancestors saw these insects emerge from soft earth and light up , they imagined that the firefly was a metamorphosis from rotting leaves or decaying bamboo . The saying , " On summer nights , rotting grass turns into fireflies , " was a natural result of observing transformations as the weather changed from season to season .  
The objective international situation has changed and the Western economies have long been stuck in a period of economic malaise . The Asia-Pacific area , however - - especially the Southeast Asian region , including Indochina , Taiwan , Hong Kong and coastal mainland China - - has produced a rich economic stimulus . People have money and their purchasing power has increased dramatically . "  
In the past I was introverted and taciturn , melancholically seeking for perfection . Today my personality has changed dramatically : I am confident and outspoken , open-minded and have a bigger heart with which to try to embrace the less than perfect people and things of this world . ( edited by Chang Chung-fang / photos by Vincent Chang / tr . by Christopher Hughes )  
The custom of raising havoc in the bridal chamber reaches back into the mists of Chinese history ; maybe it really is a " unique treasure of Chinese culture . " But as it has changed and evolved through countless generations , perhaps it has lost its original meaning , and even become a controversial practice which smacks of abusing the bride .  
Later , in 1905 , in order to tap the potential of this stock of capital , the Japanese government passed a law creating " joint-stock mutual loan companies " and later also encouraged these small companies to increase their capitalization , merge and become " mutual financing banks . " In 1989 , these again changed into ordinary commercial banks , and their traditional mutual loan business gradually declined .  
Lin Shih-chieh , who transferred from the China Junior College of Industrial and Commercial Management in Taipei to Tzu Chi Junior College of Nursing out of curiosity , recalls that in Taipei his main hobbies were smoking , drinking , and playing billiards . But when he got to Tzu Chi in Hualien , his personality changed , and after participating in volunteer work and the Buddhist study camp , he discovered that " it 's much more meaningful to expend effort for others than to just try to have fun for oneself . "  
The essence is entirely in the trailThese small foot paths and trails have gone from being the indigenous people 's " settlement trails " in earliest times , to being " military affairs roads " or " barbarian management roads , " to being the " fitness trails , " " historical sites " and " scenic routes " of today 's national park . Their roles have often changed , but their importance is the same as of old .  
When they play matchmaker for unsuspecting foreign firms , they often introduce them to inefficient enterprises . In the end not only were mainland industries not saved from their doldrums , even the foreign businesses involved in cooperative investment were dragged down into the vortex , suffering greatly . Time to sink or swim " Now the way of thinking has changed , " Zhang Zhiqun explains .  
Kwong Chi-hung , general manager of the Hong Kong Educational Publishing Company , believes that only technical adjustments will be needed in textbooks to cope with political changes . Phrases that smack of colonialism can be altered . For example , the Chinese title of the highest ranking official can be changed from zongdu ( a term corresponding to the English title " governor , " but which in Chinese carries the feeling of " viceroy " or " imperial official " ) to " chief executive . "  
But as the eviction deadline approached , some core figures changed their positions . They no longer opposed the compulsory relocation and agreed to accept a compensation formula which came out to an average of about HK $ 200,000 ( just over US $ 25,000 ) per household . As the situation took a dramatic turn , the attitude of the Hong Kong government also hardened . Some Committee members suspect that within their own group there may be some individuals colluding with the Hong Kong housing authorities to make a fast buck .  
After I changed into my costume , he rubbed my clothes in front and in back . He thought the Chinese-style clothes his mother was wearing were the most marvelous sight he had ever seen . He especially loved the bright red color , and he asked if he could dress up all in red too and go to school together with his mom .  
As the harmful effects of drugs came to be understood , drug trafficking changed from being legal to being a criminal offense around the world . There has been a significant trend toward international cooperation in fighting the drug trade . Producer , transshipment , and consumer nations have joined hands to clamp down at every link in the chain . Only in this way can narcotics activities be completely rooted out .  
With reform and liberalization , China at the end of the 20th century is growing more prosperous by the day . But despite Beijing 's promises of " one country , two systems , " and " self-rule for Hong Kong " guaranteed by Hong Kong 's Basic Law , as long as the basic nature of the totalitarian communist regime has not changed and the political straitjacket has not been loosened , does Hong Kong really have nothing to fear ?  
Under these circumstances , the government 's offshore shipping center may well have opened up a crack in the door for cross-strait shipping . Ships flying a foreign flag that have received government permission can sail straight from Kaohsiung Harbor to the mainland . What has not changed is that vessels flying the ROC flag , as always , can not cross the strait , and crafts flying the five-starred PRC flag are not allowed into Taiwan .  
Nevertheless , after modern obstetrics was developed , women 's birthing territory was moved from the home to the hospital . Those who assisted delivery changed from female midwives to OBG physicians , who are predominantly male . The natural process of birth also changed into a high-tech medical procedure .  
However , because these organizations are all run by private individuals or civic groups , and are constantly being changed in response to social problems , to date no complete statistical survey has been done which would accurately reflect the actual resources which can be provided by Taiwan 's halfway houses .  
Since the market is now up , and many provincial assemblymen who had previously opposed the plan have changed their attitudes as a result of the proposal to freeze the provincial government 's functions , the plan is moving forward again . It 's just that the sudden influx of stock will be a blow to share prices of existing stocks , and it will be hard to return financial stocks to their former level of hundreds of dollars per share .  
Born and raised in Kaohsiung , Chen left his home for a decade , coming to Taipei to attend university and graduate school and to work . He moved back to Kaohsiung only in 1993 , and only then did he discover how much his old hometown had changed . To refamiliarize himself with the old stomping grounds , he signed up to be a guide with the Takao Hill Association . " The more I came to understand it , the more I treasured this piece of earth .  
Last year , the meeting of APEC leaders was held in Manila , in the Philippines . Upon entering the country , every leader , conforming to local custom , changed into a Filipino shirt , marked by dazzling patterns and bright , fresh colors . The collective photo which all the leaders lined up for is permeated by the style and passion of Southeast Asia . It makes a strong impression on anyone who sees it , wherever they may be from .  
Taiwan 's conception of personal finance has changed a lot . Chang Shui-chiang , editor-in-chief of the Commercial Times , said when he was a guest on the program that during the " golden age " of the last decade , the middle class has risen , government restrictions have been relaxed , and there have been ample business opportunities . A conception of personal finance has become one of the foundations of economic life .  
Taiwan 's society has changed rapidly since the lifting of martial law in 1987 . Ideology and values are no longer monolithic , but pluralistic . Everyone has their own ideas . Carrie Chen , associate director of the Research Center at Kang Ho Publishing , recalls that his colleagues on the editorial committee were " very cautious " about things that were controversial in old texts , like the depiction of women and aboriginal peoples .  
Among the heavy responsibilities weighing on the superintendent 's shoulders , besides having to find financial donations , is that of finding people . Recruiting local doctors has proved difficult-several times when the hospital advertised for staff there were very few applicants , and some doctors who did agree to come and work subsequently changed their minds when another opportunity came up . The disappointed Huang Sheng-hsiung saw no choice but to cast his net wider , and try to recruit doctors from America .  
Legislators or members of the public raised questions touching on issues of education , ideology , national security , and so on . Actually , concern should mainly be focused on the substantial provisions for implementation . The Executive Yuan has assigned the MAC and the MOE to study possible relevant follow-up rules and methods . The principle of recognizing mainland degrees has not changed , and the position of the MAC on this question has never changed .  
On the contrary : birdwatchers have discovered that ever since accumulating soil from construction work upstream and an ever-decreasing flow of water caused sandbars to appear in the stretch of river near Huachiang Bridge , more and more ducks and geese have gathered there , and they have gradually extended their domain upriver to the Kuangfu , Huachung , Chungcheng and Yungfu bridges , so that the goose and duck park has had to be enlarged and its name changed .  
Some four years ago , when the architects responsible for renovating the Li Family Compound had the Lotus Flower Pool changed from its original irregular oval shape into the usual traditional half-moon shape , 77-year-old Li Yen Hsiu-feng , chairperson of the Li Family Compound management committee , insisted it be torn up and redone .  
But a name can not be changed on a whim-the content of courses and research programs has to be planned beforehand . Chou is also aware how quickly times are changing : even the situation five years from now can not be predicted , and someone who is only familiar with one branch of knowledge can not respond to change . The orientation of systems science is for students to learn how to " integrate " knowledge of different fields such as materials science , thermal flux and nuclear engineering .  
What university ? Beijing was the capital , and had a very conservative atmosphere . In the five-and-a-half years during which Tsai Yuan-pei was in charge of Beida , he changed it from a place reeking of bureaucratism to a center of lively , progressive thinking .  
Soldiers who had been exposed to the horrors of trench warfare , the constant threat of death , who had seen their brothers-in-arms wounded and killed while they themselves were unable to do anything about it , would shout and cry hysterically , or become suddenly rigid . Their personalities changed ; they became silent and unresponsive . Some even lost their memories or their senses .  
By the same reasoning , qi which condenses with sufficient harmony may be unchanging and maintain its form eternally . Humans live between heaven and earth , and can participate in the processes by which heaven and earth are nourished and life created and changed . The Yi Jing ( Book of Changes ) lays great stress on the continuous burgeoning of life within the vast universe . Thus we can see that there is a historical background to the continuous emergence of ideas concerning elixirs of immortality and fairylands peopled by immortals .  
Thus stone lions came to rank first among the amulets the ancient Chinese used to ward off evil . At first they came in the form of gigantic tomb guardians protecting the graves of kings and emperors . In the Tang dynasty China had frequent contacts with western Asia , and stone lions tended to be realistic in form ; in the Yuan , " foreign " elements were added , and curly-maned lions appeared which looked more like curly-haired dogs ; their image changed from the fierce and majestic to the lucky and lovable .  
Because of agricultural crops ' short harvesting cycles , there is as yet little alternative to controlling pest outbreaks by the moderate use of pesticides , unless production methods can be changed ; but when transient insect infestations occur in gardens or in woodland-except where " wood borers " such as ghost moths ( family Hepialidae ) or goat moths ( family Cosiidae ) , which are potentially fatal to trees , are involved-forestry experts generally advise against attempting wholesale eradication with pesticides .  
Unfortunately , in modern industrial society , the structure of family life has changed dramatically . One rarely sees the intimacy of the extended family living all together . Instead people are always busy and there is a feeling of distance between them . This situation not only provides grist for countless films and novels , it is a very real reason why growing numbers of young people are turning to sex .  
Arthur Lee , who used not to believe that ethnic Chinese formed a global economic entity , has changed his mind since the rise of the Internet . " In the past , information and commercial transactions were separate activities . When readers saw a product they liked they had to go to a shop to buy it ; but now they only need to make a few mouse clicks . Marketing and distribution problems can all be solved by the Internet , " he says .  
Shih himself has applied the right-brain concept to the commercial sphere . In the ideas about " business culture " that Shih put forward a number of years ago , he suggested that people are changed by emotional stimuli , not rational argument . This is very much in keeping with the right-brain concept . And in his " right-brain leadership " concept , put forward two years ago , Shih takes his approach a step further , proposing EQ-based , creative management .  
Many Takasago Volunteers who survived the cataclysm of the war returned to live under a " new dynasty , " the ROC , and found that their formerly Japanese-speaking world had suddenly become a Mandarin one . The language of the broadcast media had changed overnight , along with the dominant ideology . As time went by , their children and grandchildren grew up under the educational system of the nationalist government , completely different from the system during the Japanese era , and the ex-Volunteers became a lonely , lost group .  
A half-century ago , our image of the Han period still rested entirely upon what we could learn from historical records , but all that changed beginning in 1972 thanks to a series of major archeological finds at a number of tombs dating back to the Han dynasty . A huge quantity of silks , wooden tomb figurines , bamboo slips used for writing , and other burial items cast an entirely new light upon the way Chinese people lived two millennia ago .  
Lin Yi-shih has gone from scouring temple courtyards and other public gathering places for worthy competitors to participating in international competitions . Steven Chen , once playing out endgames from a night market hawker 's stand , now provides an Internet site where the best players can meet . The lives of these two chess masters have certainly changed dramatically . But that is only appropriate , since Chinese chess has itself had quite a varied and colorful life history .  
In Guangzhou , the ideal of constitutional politics was never realized . The government system there changed frequently and proved to be no more stable or capable than the northern regime .  
West Lake in Hangzhou is n't famous just for its beauty , but also for the fact that it was there that Xu Xian met his star-crossed lover , the beautiful Bai Niang-niang ( a snake spirit who took a fancy to Xu and changed into human form to marry him ) . Writers have penned moving descriptions of their love story , and no Chinese can visit the lake without thinking of the fabled romance between man and enchantress .  
There is no doubt such ideas encouraged teachers to set themselves up-and be accepted by others-as awe-inspiring authority figures . As times have changed , the pedestals on which teachers were formerly placed have been steadily knocked down . The concept of equal rights has replaced that of hierarchy . Wendy Lin says that as the ethical basis of traditional education has evaporated , teachers have found that they have needed to buttress their fading authority by inflicting pain physically and verbally .  
While the star school phenomenon is not something that can be changed overnight , the pecking order among middle rank schools is already growing blurred . If high schools work together to raise the quality of education , perhaps the star school syndrome will just fade away on its own .  
But county executive Chen Shui-tsai , who was in the military for decades and maintains close contacts with the local defense command , says that while he understands the importance of military security , people must recognize that Kinmen 's role has changed from that of defender to communicator . The military , he says , will simply have to make the necessary adjustments to coordinate with the implementation of the little three links . " The security-related measures chosen by the Ministry of Defense will be key to the smooth implementation of the little three links . "  
Tribute candy , a blend of peanuts and maltose , was originally called " ground candy " in Fujian because the peanuts used in making it are ground continuously to give it the proper crumbly texture . The name changed on Kinmen because few of the ROC soldiers who secured the island understood the Fujianese word for " grind . " These soldiers instead took to calling the candy " tribute candy , " and the new name , which has a similar sound as well as conveying an air of imperial quality , stuck .  
" Although the ban against building new houses resulted in the preservation of many traditional homes , back when soldiers were billeted in every home they covered the walls with patriotic slogans , seriously defacing the property . Moreover , " says Yang Shu-ching , " cultural studies were seen as unimportant , so there was no one to carry such things out . By the time martial law was lifted , many aspects of Kinmen culture had changed and could no longer easily be studied . "  
In 1874 the Japanese , acting under the pretext that certain Ryukyu islanders had been murdered in Taiwan , sent a military expedition to occupy Mutanshe in southern Taiwan . Then in 1884 France , having declared war on China , attacked and shut down Keelung . All this made the Manchu court realize Taiwan 's importance as a gateway to the seven provinces along the southeastern coast . Clearly , the aims of foreign powers vis-a-vis Taiwan had changed .  
Women were dependent , the instruments of reproduction . But the industrial revolution changed all that . Women joined the production lines , home appliances reduced the time and energy women had to spend in the home , and liberated women began to enter society . As women have become equals in terms of financial support of the family , society has been transformed , and the forms of the family have become diversified .  
But seeing the imitation by Ni Min-ran has changed his perspective : " Though the Annette Lu character is exaggerated and lampooned , it also draws attention to the more attractive side of the vice-president . Lu comes across as being as warm and caring as a country grandmother , and she does n't give up in the face of misunderstanding . Though she is unpolished and undiplomatic , she nonetheless wants to do something for the country ! "  
When students used to come from southern Taiwan to Taipei to study 20 years ago , they were warned about Taipei 's gray and wet winters . Friends and relatives reminded them to carry a newspaper with them at all times to keep off the fine rain of the northeastern monsoon . Over the years , however , Taipei 's winters have changed , becoming drier and less overcast .  
With this concept they came up with their 500 cc ice beverage model , which they have since rolled out across all of Taiwan . Their stainless-steel counters , automatic sealers , in-store preparation for take-out , and prominent giant cup sign have changed the face of ice drink retailing in Taiwan .  
Over the last few years , Li Hsien-wen 's life has changed quite a lot . He not only eats vegetarian , but he has also moved to the countryside and abandoned burdensome clothing such as suit and tie . At the same time , he has influenced his wife , who began practicing calligraphy three years ago . When she is free she copies a bit of traditional poetry , and able to settle in at her house , she no longer feels lonely .  
Stanley Yen complained that once the tourism industry finally got a school established to train professional chefs , the structure of Taiwan 's tertiary education system changed and many technical junior colleges were redesignated as four-year colleges . As a result , the most talented graduates of the cooking school ended up teaching rather than working in food services , and Taiwan lost its opportunity to produce international-caliber chefs .  
Thereafter Taiwan 's economy was transformed from relying mainly on agriculture to one dominated by light industry , and forestry lost its former importance . Forestry policy was changed from maximizing production to cutting of timber only on small areas in a planned way .  
He has experienced " snow blindness " from carving too long under the rays of a magnifying lamp . He would feel pain in both eyes and see nothing but white everywhere . Only after going to the doctor did he recognize that the extremely close-up work of carving combined with the reflection of the white fluorescent lamp light from the white eggshell was , after long-term exposure , injuring his eyes . At his physician 's suggestion , he changed the fluorescent lamp for an incandescent bulb and his condition improved somewhat .  
The Japanese faced fierce resistance in the early years of the colonial period , especially in the central and southern parts of the island . Many administrative orders went ignored outside of Taipei 's walled district where the colonial government was headquartered , and the post of governor-general changed hands in rapid succession . Relative stability was not achieved until Gentaro Gotama took over and appointed Shinpei Goto as his chief administrator . The building housing today 's Taiwan Museum was originally built in memory of these two men .  
It is still in operation , on track to celebrate its 70th birthday in 2004 . Two or three generations of people in a single family may share the collective memory of dishes like " French Provincial Duck , " which have changed not at all since the 1930s . The restaurant also continues its tradition , dating back to the Japanese colonial era , but having all male staff . One change , however , is that the waiters no longer are required to have their heads shaved , though they still sport uniform hair styles .  
When NTU absorbed the Agricultural Division of TIU , it changed its name to the College of Agriculture ( CoA ) . With seven academic departments it was NTU 's largest college . Later , the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine was split into two , and the mechanical engineering group in the agricultural engineering department became a separate department . The CoA gradually expanded to 12 departments .  
The amended family provisions are more equal . There is now much greater flexibility for judges in granting divorces ; any property acquired by a woman before marriage remains hers without the need for further proof that its ownership status has not changed ; and the tradition of nearly always awarding custody of children to the father has been shattered , with the best interests of the child now the standard for deciding custody .  
Suo points out that in recent years , the proportion of reported TB cases that have been changed from " suspected " to " confirmed negative " has increased from 10% to 20% . Some patients are blindly given medication even though it is unclear whether they in fact have contracted tuberculosis . Other patients , unable to obtain specialized medical care , spread M . tuberculosis while wandering from one regular health care institution to another .  
Tang says that in college , most of his classmates were immersed in leftist thinking for a long time , and generally identified with the more " progressive " political party . But since the DPP won the presidential election in 2000 , the nature of politics has changed , and people have scattered among the various political parties . Policy has become more important than party identification , and different people work for different parties often just because they support some very specific policies of a given party .  
Taiwan has a long history of live performance , from simple shows held in crude tents , to fancy choreographed acts with crystal stages and catwalks , and everything in between . Audiences have changed their preferences in step with the changing times . Different audiences have had unique preferences and enjoyed special interactions with certain stars .  
From finding a " mother structure " of artistic technique close to his own personal tendencies , to overcoming the staid or bewildered aspects of his art and nurturing a " child structure " opposite to his own basic character , Chou 's own perspective on life has changed , so that he has become smoother in the way he deals with people .  
Kids do n't have the least opportunity to figure out what it is they really like as individuals . Gerald Durrell , author of My Family and Other Animals , never had single day of formal schooling , but enjoyed a childhood in which he had no particular goals set for him and could follow his own interests entirely . In this setting , he developed a deep love and understanding of animals and changed world conservation history . What would have happened to Durrell if he had been born in Taiwan ?  
" The conception has completely changed , " says Chen . " We 're letting people understand that traditional tourism was greedy and selfish and did n't protect the local people 's environment . " There are a thousand loose ends to tie , but the beautiful future of ecotourism-which aims to reconnect people with nature , raise the quality of life , mend the environment and create sustainable business-is worth collectively striving for .  
But in less than half an hour , the calm weather changed drastically . A violent wind blew in laden with snow . The Russian pilot , experienced in polar transportation and supply , decided to withdraw immediately . On hearing the shouts of the other crewmembers the groups that were dispersed around the pole taking photos raced toward the helicopter .  
During the past 60 years , an industry has developed around one type of fish which arrived in Taiwan as smuggled bounty . Since then , Taiwan tilapia has seen its name changed continually , seen selective breeding applied to improve its stock . As the industry has developed , Taiwan tilapia has continued to expand its territory . Of Taiwan 's 52 main rivers , only two have not become part of its domain .  
Holes were patched with pieces of broken tile , a mixture of lime and sand was applied as a base , and then a layer made up of a mixture of brown sugar and lime was applied over it . The terrazo and tile floors of the interior and the halls were completely changed out and replaced with traditional unglazed tiles .  
It took the US and Europe some two to three hundred years to make the transition from preindustrial to industrial society , and this transition extended into the mid-20th century . It was during this period that the concept of retirement was born as circumstances changed .

By the same reasoning , qi which condenses with sufficient harmony may be unchanging and maintain its form eternally . Humans live between heaven and earth , and can participate in the processes by which heaven and earth are nourished and life created and changed . The Yi Jing ( Book of Changes ) lays great stress on the continuous burgeoning of life within the vast universe . Thus we can see that there is a historical background to the continuous emergence of ideas concerning elixirs of immortality and fairylands peopled by immortals .  
Thus stone lions came to rank first among the amulets the ancient Chinese used to ward off evil . At first they came in the form of gigantic tomb guardians protecting the graves of kings and emperors . In the Tang dynasty China had frequent contacts with western Asia , and stone lions tended to be realistic in form ; in the Yuan , " foreign " elements were added , and curly-maned lions appeared which looked more like curly-haired dogs ; their image changed from the fierce and majestic to the lucky and lovable .  
Because of agricultural crops ' short harvesting cycles , there is as yet little alternative to controlling pest outbreaks by the moderate use of pesticides , unless production methods can be changed ; but when transient insect infestations occur in gardens or in woodland-except where " wood borers " such as ghost moths ( family Hepialidae ) or goat moths ( family Cosiidae ) , which are potentially fatal to trees , are involved-forestry experts generally advise against attempting wholesale eradication with pesticides .  
Unfortunately , in modern industrial society , the structure of family life has changed dramatically . One rarely sees the intimacy of the extended family living all together . Instead people are always busy and there is a feeling of distance between them . This situation not only provides grist for countless films and novels , it is a very real reason why growing numbers of young people are turning to sex .  
Arthur Lee , who used not to believe that ethnic Chinese formed a global economic entity , has changed his mind since the rise of the Internet . " In the past , information and commercial transactions were separate activities . When readers saw a product they liked they had to go to a shop to buy it ; but now they only need to make a few mouse clicks . Marketing and distribution problems can all be solved by the Internet , " he says .  
Shih himself has applied the right-brain concept to the commercial sphere . In the ideas about " business culture " that Shih put forward a number of years ago , he suggested that people are changed by emotional stimuli , not rational argument . This is very much in keeping with the right-brain concept . And in his " right-brain leadership " concept , put forward two years ago , Shih takes his approach a step further , proposing EQ-based , creative management .  
Many Takasago Volunteers who survived the cataclysm of the war returned to live under a " new dynasty , " the ROC , and found that their formerly Japanese-speaking world had suddenly become a Mandarin one . The language of the broadcast media had changed overnight , along with the dominant ideology . As time went by , their children and grandchildren grew up under the educational system of the nationalist government , completely different from the system during the Japanese era , and the ex-Volunteers became a lonely , lost group .  
A half-century ago , our image of the Han period still rested entirely upon what we could learn from historical records , but all that changed beginning in 1972 thanks to a series of major archeological finds at a number of tombs dating back to the Han dynasty . A huge quantity of silks , wooden tomb figurines , bamboo slips used for writing , and other burial items cast an entirely new light upon the way Chinese people lived two millennia ago .  
Lin Yi-shih has gone from scouring temple courtyards and other public gathering places for worthy competitors to participating in international competitions . Steven Chen , once playing out endgames from a night market hawker 's stand , now provides an Internet site where the best players can meet . The lives of these two chess masters have certainly changed dramatically . But that is only appropriate , since Chinese chess has itself had quite a varied and colorful life history .  
In Guangzhou , the ideal of constitutional politics was never realized . The government system there changed frequently and proved to be no more stable or capable than the northern regime .  
West Lake in Hangzhou is n't famous just for its beauty , but also for the fact that it was there that Xu Xian met his star-crossed lover , the beautiful Bai Niang-niang ( a snake spirit who took a fancy to Xu and changed into human form to marry him ) . Writers have penned moving descriptions of their love story , and no Chinese can visit the lake without thinking of the fabled romance between man and enchantress .  
There is no doubt such ideas encouraged teachers to set themselves up-and be accepted by others-as awe-inspiring authority figures . As times have changed , the pedestals on which teachers were formerly placed have been steadily knocked down . The concept of equal rights has replaced that of hierarchy . Wendy Lin says that as the ethical basis of traditional education has evaporated , teachers have found that they have needed to buttress their fading authority by inflicting pain physically and verbally .  
While the star school phenomenon is not something that can be changed overnight , the pecking order among middle rank schools is already growing blurred . If high schools work together to raise the quality of education , perhaps the star school syndrome will just fade away on its own .  
But county executive Chen Shui-tsai , who was in the military for decades and maintains close contacts with the local defense command , says that while he understands the importance of military security , people must recognize that Kinmen 's role has changed from that of defender to communicator . The military , he says , will simply have to make the necessary adjustments to coordinate with the implementation of the little three links . " The security-related measures chosen by the Ministry of Defense will be key to the smooth implementation of the little three links . "  
Tribute candy , a blend of peanuts and maltose , was originally called " ground candy " in Fujian because the peanuts used in making it are ground continuously to give it the proper crumbly texture . The name changed on Kinmen because few of the ROC soldiers who secured the island understood the Fujianese word for " grind . " These soldiers instead took to calling the candy " tribute candy , " and the new name , which has a similar sound as well as conveying an air of imperial quality , stuck .  
" Although the ban against building new houses resulted in the preservation of many traditional homes , back when soldiers were billeted in every home they covered the walls with patriotic slogans , seriously defacing the property . Moreover , " says Yang Shu-ching , " cultural studies were seen as unimportant , so there was no one to carry such things out . By the time martial law was lifted , many aspects of Kinmen culture had changed and could no longer easily be studied . "  
In 1874 the Japanese , acting under the pretext that certain Ryukyu islanders had been murdered in Taiwan , sent a military expedition to occupy Mutanshe in southern Taiwan . Then in 1884 France , having declared war on China , attacked and shut down Keelung . All this made the Manchu court realize Taiwan 's importance as a gateway to the seven provinces along the southeastern coast . Clearly , the aims of foreign powers vis-a-vis Taiwan had changed .  
Women were dependent , the instruments of reproduction . But the industrial revolution changed all that . Women joined the production lines , home appliances reduced the time and energy women had to spend in the home , and liberated women began to enter society . As women have become equals in terms of financial support of the family , society has been transformed , and the forms of the family have become diversified .  
But seeing the imitation by Ni Min-ran has changed his perspective : " Though the Annette Lu character is exaggerated and lampooned , it also draws attention to the more attractive side of the vice-president . Lu comes across as being as warm and caring as a country grandmother , and she does n't give up in the face of misunderstanding . Though she is unpolished and undiplomatic , she nonetheless wants to do something for the country ! "  
When students used to come from southern Taiwan to Taipei to study 20 years ago , they were warned about Taipei 's gray and wet winters . Friends and relatives reminded them to carry a newspaper with them at all times to keep off the fine rain of the northeastern monsoon . Over the years , however , Taipei 's winters have changed , becoming drier and less overcast .  
With this concept they came up with their 500 cc ice beverage model , which they have since rolled out across all of Taiwan . Their stainless-steel counters , automatic sealers , in-store preparation for take-out , and prominent giant cup sign have changed the face of ice drink retailing in Taiwan .  
Over the last few years , Li Hsien-wen 's life has changed quite a lot . He not only eats vegetarian , but he has also moved to the countryside and abandoned burdensome clothing such as suit and tie . At the same time , he has influenced his wife , who began practicing calligraphy three years ago . When she is free she copies a bit of traditional poetry , and able to settle in at her house , she no longer feels lonely .  
Stanley Yen complained that once the tourism industry finally got a school established to train professional chefs , the structure of Taiwan 's tertiary education system changed and many technical junior colleges were redesignated as four-year colleges . As a result , the most talented graduates of the cooking school ended up teaching rather than working in food services , and Taiwan lost its opportunity to produce international-caliber chefs .  
Thereafter Taiwan 's economy was transformed from relying mainly on agriculture to one dominated by light industry , and forestry lost its former importance . Forestry policy was changed from maximizing production to cutting of timber only on small areas in a planned way .  
He has experienced " snow blindness " from carving too long under the rays of a magnifying lamp . He would feel pain in both eyes and see nothing but white everywhere . Only after going to the doctor did he recognize that the extremely close-up work of carving combined with the reflection of the white fluorescent lamp light from the white eggshell was , after long-term exposure , injuring his eyes . At his physician 's suggestion , he changed the fluorescent lamp for an incandescent bulb and his condition improved somewhat .  
The Japanese faced fierce resistance in the early years of the colonial period , especially in the central and southern parts of the island . Many administrative orders went ignored outside of Taipei 's walled district where the colonial government was headquartered , and the post of governor-general changed hands in rapid succession . Relative stability was not achieved until Gentaro Gotama took over and appointed Shinpei Goto as his chief administrator . The building housing today 's Taiwan Museum was originally built in memory of these two men .  
It is still in operation , on track to celebrate its 70th birthday in 2004 . Two or three generations of people in a single family may share the collective memory of dishes like " French Provincial Duck , " which have changed not at all since the 1930s . The restaurant also continues its tradition , dating back to the Japanese colonial era , but having all male staff . One change , however , is that the waiters no longer are required to have their heads shaved , though they still sport uniform hair styles .  
When NTU absorbed the Agricultural Division of TIU , it changed its name to the College of Agriculture ( CoA ) . With seven academic departments it was NTU 's largest college . Later , the Department of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine was split into two , and the mechanical engineering group in the agricultural engineering department became a separate department . The CoA gradually expanded to 12 departments .  
The amended family provisions are more equal . There is now much greater flexibility for judges in granting divorces ; any property acquired by a woman before marriage remains hers without the need for further proof that its ownership status has not changed ; and the tradition of nearly always awarding custody of children to the father has been shattered , with the best interests of the child now the standard for deciding custody .  
Suo points out that in recent years , the proportion of reported TB cases that have been changed from " suspected " to " confirmed negative " has increased from 10% to 20% . Some patients are blindly given medication even though it is unclear whether they in fact have contracted tuberculosis . Other patients , unable to obtain specialized medical care , spread M . tuberculosis while wandering from one regular health care institution to another .  
Tang says that in college , most of his classmates were immersed in leftist thinking for a long time , and generally identified with the more " progressive " political party . But since the DPP won the presidential election in 2000 , the nature of politics has changed , and people have scattered among the various political parties . Policy has become more important than party identification , and different people work for different parties often just because they support some very specific policies of a given party .  
Taiwan has a long history of live performance , from simple shows held in crude tents , to fancy choreographed acts with crystal stages and catwalks , and everything in between . Audiences have changed their preferences in step with the changing times . Different audiences have had unique preferences and enjoyed special interactions with certain stars .  
From finding a " mother structure " of artistic technique close to his own personal tendencies , to overcoming the staid or bewildered aspects of his art and nurturing a " child structure " opposite to his own basic character , Chou 's own perspective on life has changed , so that he has become smoother in the way he deals with people .  
Kids do n't have the least opportunity to figure out what it is they really like as individuals . Gerald Durrell , author of My Family and Other Animals , never had single day of formal schooling , but enjoyed a childhood in which he had no particular goals set for him and could follow his own interests entirely . In this setting , he developed a deep love and understanding of animals and changed world conservation history . What would have happened to Durrell if he had been born in Taiwan ?  
" The conception has completely changed , " says Chen . " We 're letting people understand that traditional tourism was greedy and selfish and did n't protect the local people 's environment . " There are a thousand loose ends to tie , but the beautiful future of ecotourism-which aims to reconnect people with nature , raise the quality of life , mend the environment and create sustainable business-is worth collectively striving for .  
But in less than half an hour , the calm weather changed drastically . A violent wind blew in laden with snow . The Russian pilot , experienced in polar transportation and supply , decided to withdraw immediately . On hearing the shouts of the other crewmembers the groups that were dispersed around the pole taking photos raced toward the helicopter .  
During the past 60 years , an industry has developed around one type of fish which arrived in Taiwan as smuggled bounty . Since then , Taiwan tilapia has seen its name changed continually , seen selective breeding applied to improve its stock . As the industry has developed , Taiwan tilapia has continued to expand its territory . Of Taiwan 's 52 main rivers , only two have not become part of its domain .  
Holes were patched with pieces of broken tile , a mixture of lime and sand was applied as a base , and then a layer made up of a mixture of brown sugar and lime was applied over it . The terrazo and tile floors of the interior and the halls were completely changed out and replaced with traditional unglazed tiles .  
It took the US and Europe some two to three hundred years to make the transition from preindustrial to industrial society , and this transition extended into the mid-20th century . It was during this period that the concept of retirement was born as circumstances changed . Concerned about productive forces , capitalists took into consideration the relative physical and technological backwardness of middle-aged and older workers and began to draw up retirement systems .  
China and Sri Lanka are close and friendly neighbors , the two countries have enjoyed traditional friendship , Jiang said Although international situation has changed greatly since China and Sri Lanka established diplomatic ties over 40 years ago , the two countries have always enjoyed mutual trust and support  
Technology is no longer a determinate and static component of manufacturing ; as with human resources , it is a variable in the production process that can be changed , improved and modified through innovative management .  
While the Working Capital Fund is the primary source of reserve capital in respect of the regular budget , its level ( $ 100-million , less amounts required to meet unforeseen expenditures ) has not been changed since 1982 .  
The changed pattern of adult morbidity is reflected in the increased number of patients suffering from noncontagious mass chronic diseases but also in the renewed incidence of contagious diseases .  
P �� ez-Otermin ( Uruguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : In this changed world that came out of the Second World War more global and interdependent Uruguay wishes to reaffirm its confidence in the vital role played by the United Nations in the preservation of peace and in solving the main problems affecting the world , and it wishes to confirm the validity of the enlightened principles of the Charter , as sound today as they were 50 years ago .  
The aim of a comprehensive financial reform must be to establish a transparent and reliable scale , reflective of Members ' real capacity to pay , automatically adaptable to changed national circumstances and giving consideration to the needs of countries with low per capita incomes .  
This statement of intent has changed nothing : the reality of the situation is that the sanctions imposed on Iraq have been continued as a means of collectively punishing an entire people , and the steps required from Iraq to end the sanctions have remained as vague as they have always been in the Council 's resolutions , as in paragraph 21 of resolution 687 ( 1991 ) , for instance .  
It has been said , but can not be repeated enough and no school of thought , no economic-development specialist can contradict me that the development process in Africa will come to a standstill if the efforts of the African States continue to be bogged down by the burden of external debt , if flows of capital continue to be insufficient , if the obstacles limiting market access persist , if commodities are not diversified or changed and if the terms of trade remain depressed .  
As a result , the number of households that do not have sufficient income to satisfy basic needs for food and other goods and services that depend on current income levels has substantially increased , although the number of households that do not have access to adequate housing , potable water and other basic services that do not depend so much on income in the short term has not changed much .  
The need for and the basic objectives of disarmament have remained constant throughout the years , but the approaches to the subject and the scope of deliberations have changed as a reflection of varying political realities and international conditions .  3 .  At the very outset , the approach pursued was quite broad .  
This was the case for countries that had fixed exchange rates and whose economies were characterized by inordinate inflation and for still others that experienced volatile movements of exchange rates , which often changed much more than internal prices over time , as a result of capital flight and speculation as well as other effects of international capital markets .  
In the case of Belarus the problem of outstanding contributions for peace-keeping operations has taken on a particularly acute , and it would not be exaggerated to say , offensive character , primarily owing to the fact that the original motives for assigning Belarus to group ( b ) have become historically obsolete , its legal status under international law has changed and its economic situation has greatly deteriorated . 
Also , in this regard , following the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations ( April 1994 ) , which included agriculture for the first time in a substantive fashion , there has been a growing interest by developing countries in coming to grips with the changed international trading environment for agriculture and FAO has been developing a programme to respond to this need .  
The traditional mechanisms of the international codification process had also changed and new challenges had emerged which necessitated a quick and effective response to legal emergencies ; thus , under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency , two multilateral conventions had been adopted in 1986 relating to early warning and assistance in the case of nuclear accidents .  
The corresponding combined total figures for the regular budget , peace-keeping operations and international tribunals should be changed from $ 1,872,734,590 to $ 1,872,666,930 for the current period , from $ 2,884,441,868 to $ 2,884,374,208 for the grand total and from $ 3,200,852 to $ 3,197,130 for assessments within the 30-day-due period included in the grand total .  
Some leading representatives of the international community pointed out on more than one occasion that it was operation " Storm " that changed the strategic balance in the former Yugoslavia and paved the way for the negotiated peaceful reintegration of the remaining occupied areas of Croatia and a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Bosnia .  
erstwhile rivalry , sometimes violent , that had existed among the nine political parties formed during the struggle against the Soviet-backed Government , appeared to have changed into a conflict among three major armed groups : the Taliban , the forces controlled by General Dostum and his allies in the Supreme Coordination Council , and the government forces of President Rabbani .  
were only two solutions : one would be for the current system to be radically changed so as to incorporate the specialized agencies as major players in determining conditions of service for the staff ; the other would be to allow the staff of the specialized agencies and technical programmes to develop their own system so that they could get on with the important tasks that needed to be addressed urgently .  
Nevertheless , just as we understand that the world has changed , that there is a new international agenda governed by the common concerns of all peoples over environment preservation , population growth , respect for human rights , strengthening of democratic systems , recognition of women 's rights , and the social and economic development of nations , we also understand that this Organization must be renewed and readapted to the new world circumstances . 
The situation in the Great Lakes region of Africa , now so dramatically changed in the space of a few days , underlines the importance of being prepared to respond in a timely , coordinated and effective manner to humanitarian crises in order to alleviate the suffering of our fellow human beings .  
However , the economy of the territory has not changed and the occupying authority , Israel , is continuing its old practices , which are incompatible with international law and local custom , including unjustified detention , blockades , collective punishment and the expansion of existing settlements .  
Taking into account the foregoing evaluation of institutions charged with protecting human rights and the radically changed political and human rights situation , the responsibilities of MICIVIH during a next phase would consist of two main elements : ( a ) technical assistance in the field of institution-building based on the observation and evaluation of institutional performance and reforms with reference to human rights ; and ( b ) the development of a programme for the promotion and protection of human rights .  
Responding to questions raised by the Committee with respect to article 1 , she noted that exemptions from the principle of equality were based on objective criteria and precise rules formulated as laws following broad consultations with institutional and other partners .  Their purpose was to permit certain territorial adaptations in the organization of the principles recognized in the Constitution ; the principles themselves could not be changed .  
Institution and capacity-building , comprising education and training , generation of awareness , and strengthening of national , subregional and regional institutions , are among the activities that have been ongoing for a long period of time , although the specific activities have changed over the years in the light of the changing situation and problems to be addressed at the national , regional or global level .  
The Commission may recall that at its fourth session , all delegations and representatives of the intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations that contributed to the debate on the Ninth Congress expressed their satisfaction with the successful conduct of the proceedings and its productive results , in spite of the fact that the time available for pre-Congress consultations and the Ninth Congress itself had to be shortened , that the venue of the Congress had to be changed , and that all preparatory arrangements had to be completed in only a few months .  
Egypt 's privatization policy changed in 1994 , moving away from outright sales of state enterprises towards more gradual disinvestment through the sale of shares in the country 's stock market and through long-term lease and management contracts .  Economic liberalization continued in the Syrian Arab Republic , but no major privatization is envisioned in the near future .  
Since the adoption by the General Assembly of its resolution 49 / 108 , UNIDO has advanced a major process of programmatic and managerial reform , responding to changed industrial realities and support requirements both by a substantive reformulation of its priorities and focus and by internal reforms in management and organizational structure with a view to increasing effectiveness , efficiency and impact .  
From a technical perspective , to be compatible with the definition of long-term migrant proposed in paragraph 8 above , the stock of international migrants should include all persons who have ever changed their country of usual residence , that is , persons who have spent at least one year of their lives in a country other than the one in which they live at a particular point in time .  
Undocumented migration has existed for a long time and was in many cases tolerated , but economic recession and high unemployment have changed the context , and some sectors , as reflected in public opinion , feel undocumented migrants are compromising their social and economic security , and have been vocal about Government inability to regulate flows .  
The shared effort to build a culture of peace in the region has changed from an academic discussion to a fact of everyday life , in which we are promoting and fostering the concrete values of peace : tolerance , respect for human rights , solidarity , social justice and the rejection of violence as a method of resolving social or any other type of conflicts , all elements that are contributing to the integral development of our peoples .  
VIII . 177 .  The Advisory Committee was informed that the arrangements for common and joint services in Vienna that had been in place since 1979 and were based on a tripartite agreement between IAEA , UNIDO and the United Nations , have changed to the extent that certain programmes have become increasingly difficult to maintain at the previous levels .  
It is noteworthy that the financial resources of the Centres continued to decline in the post-cold-war era despite a broad recognition that the Centres could play a meaningful role in the changed international security environment where regional approaches to disarmament have acquired increasing importance .  
This resolution not only establishes an important landmark , as we have been advocating for more than three years now , but also demonstrates the determination of the international community to recognize that in promoting development in the vastly changed process of globalization and rapidly growing interdependence , there is no alternative to a constructive dialogue based on the imperatives of mutual interest and benefits , shared responsibilities and genuine interdependence .  
When the Committee was formed over four decades ago , the major challenge that faced it was how to play a major role in one of the most fundamental global transformations in history a transformation that changed the complexion of the international community .  
The democratic process is not being paralysed by the war : it was already paralysed and the constitutional drafts that have been prepared are not satisfactory to the large majorities which are still represented in the National Sovereign Conference and are , of course , likely to be changed by another authentic national agreement .  
In the regions bombarded by gas bombs , grass changed its colour into yellow brown , things including copper alloy into blue green and silver rings into a dusty colour .  
Moreover , this pre-emptive stance of monetary policy , at insignificant rates of inflation , appears to make no acknowledgement of the fact that inflationary expectations have changed significantly since the 1970s and 1980s , and that the structural and technical changes that have occurred in the developed economies since then have reduced the likelihood of present wage and price setting behaviour being quickly reversed .  
The internationalization of the economy of the United States as well as of that of most countries as a result of improved communications , declining transport costs , trade liberalization , and global financial integration has stimulated a wide range of economic activities and changed the international division of labour in many industries . 
If the primary injured subject changed from , e.g . , the individual to a State of which he is a national , this would affect the application of the rule of the exhaustion of local remedies insofar as it did not apply in the case of a composite wrongful act .  
While the Commission could not express an opinion , for example , on whether expropriation was a continuing or a completed wrongful act , it could emphasize the primacy of article 18 , so that acts that had been complete at a time when they had been lawful did not subsequently become the subject of contention because the law had changed .  
Globalization , diversification of forms of migration , the declining role of State leadership in migration , decrease of State _ organized migration as compared to spontaneous migration , increase in temporary migration , growth of private recruitment agencies , increase in irregular migration , trade in human beings and - what is very important - feminization of migration have substantially changed the context of contemporary migration .  
In the five months that have elapsed , many people have registered to participate , and the Government has selected 181 of them ; dates have been set and postponed ; venues have been selected and changed ; the proposed facilitators referred to earlier have visited the country ; and three committees have been established .  However , a national debate has yet to be held , and only the Organizational Committee is in operation .  
Within a year , the combined current account of these five countries has changed from a deficit of about $ 25-billion in 1997 to a surplus of almost $ 72-billion in 1998.4 This dramatic turnaround reflected factors due to a sharp cut in external finance , cuts in imports , and recently significant increases in exports . 
It is , perhaps , ironic that this impasse in international commodity policy , which has continued throughout the 1990s , began just as the dominant feature of world commodity markets changed ( as explained in the previous Section ) from excessive short-term price volatility to a sharp downward trend in real commodity prices .  
This has now changed to a vicious circle of depressed exports which discouraged investment , and vice versa ; the depression spread over the region and dampened exports which , together with low consumption resulting from uncertain economic prospects decreased aggregate demand and discouraged investment for the future .  
Much has changed since the World Assembly on Ageing , which was held in Vienna in 1982 , when it was first acknowledged in an important international forum that the ageing of the population was not confined to the industrialized world but was actually going to have its greatest impact in our developing countries .  
Yet it further stated that , apart from the statistical definition of the term youth mentioned above , the meaning of the term youth varied in different societies around the world and that definitions of youth had changed continuously in response to fluctuating political , economic and sociocultural circumstances .  
Points of public concern include matters such as continuity in the provision of public services ; adherence to environmental protection , health , safety and quality standards set by the host country ; fairness of prices charged to the public ; non-discriminatory treatment of customers or users , full disclosure of information pertaining to the operation of infrastructure facilities and the flexibility needed to meet changed conditions , including expansion of the service to meet additional demand .  
Secondly , some of the key elements of the United Nations Charter , which were presumed essential when the United Nations was established , have become totally irrelevant in the vastly changed present global political and economic context .  
Expansion of the membership must be responsive to the changed global political and economic climate , reflecting the new realities in the global arena and respecting the principles of sovereign equality among all States and equitable geographical distribution .  
However , it was also recognized that , apart from that statistical definition , the meaning of the term youth varied in different societies around the world and that definitions of youth had changed continuously in response to fluctuating political , economic and socio-cultural circumstances .  
The key findings , recommendations and emerging actions that result from this body of evaluative work stress that many UNDP / GEF-funded projects produce catalytic , and replicable effects that go beyond project-specific goals : greater awareness about global environmental issues ( at the local and national level ) ; changed attitudes ; the establishment of new policies and regulations ; and the replication of successful project approaches .  
The Third Assessment Report ( published in 2001 ) , has projected that carbon dioxide concentrations and surface temperatures will increase globally , and asserted that the earths climate system had changed , globally and regionally , with most of the warming observed over the last 50 years attributable to human activities .
