The transit of Venus , the celestial wonder of Venus passing between the Earth and the Sun , will happen on June 8 this year .  During which people will be reminded of historical incidents that determined the majority of the modern political and cultural nature of the South Pacific by unusual means .  
The " ethnic image culture " studies the traditional shapes and forms of the historical culture of a nationality ( ethnic group ) , including the creation and development processes of a specific image or craft , its workmanship and technical characteristics , outer shapes and patterns , as well as other physical and ideological contents such as an image 's general features , layout , and the culture , religion , political concepts , and aesthetic evaluations contained .  
Due to differences in country 's situations , differences in economic development levels , cultural backgrounds , historical traditions , and social systems , each country should formulate suitable , effective population policies according to the actual situation of the native country .  
We must firmly redress the erroneous tendency to neglect ideological and political work and to " pay more attention to material progress than to cultural and ideological progress " in some places and departments ; develop a stronger sense of responsibility and urgency ; and conscientiously pay attention to and step up the effort to solve a series of major issues facing the effort to strengthen and improve ideological and political work , from the perspective of consolidating the party 's status as a ruling party and accomplishing the party 's historical mission .  
However , the " maximum training method " of the missile company raised a historical challenge against the traditional method of launching missiles .  The so-called " maximum training method " is to have launchers engage in strenuous exercise first so their pulse rates will reach about 150 per minute .  Immediately the launchers will be asked to launch a missile .  This training is designed to assimilate the psychological state of being in a real combat , so as to train the launchers the ability of stabilizing their emotions in a tense situation .  
The eight-point proposal was put forward in good time exactly at such a historical moment , and it therefore evoked great repercussions on both sides of the Taiwan Straits , and among the circles of overseas Chinese and Chinese nationals residing in overseas areas ; meanwhile , the international community also cherished the hope that the two sides of the strait could seize the opportunity to promote their mutual relations , and make contribution to the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region .  
For historical reasons , the agricultural structure of major production areas is rather simplistic .  In the current situation in which grain and cotton are in excess supply , the task of structural readjustment has become ever more arduous .  
Currently , we are in an important historical period at the turn of two centuries .  Our country 's reform is in the period of storming the fortifications .  Faced with the changeable situation in the world and various complicated social phenomena , some people are at a loss and puzzled .  This is not strange .  The key is that our ideological and political work must adapt to the new situations in China and abroad .  The work must adapt to new changes in our society , politics , economy and cultural lives .  
China is a big country having a cultural origin for 5,000 years .  Under the conditions that the market economic structure was established not long ago , the cultural industry has not taken shape , and the cultural market mechanism has not been perfected , the challenges from opening up China 's cultural markets to the outside world are self-evident , and the opportunities objectively exist too .  The crux of the issue is how the government and enterprises will meet with the challenges and seize hold of the rare historical opportunities .  
Purbu Zhoima said : In view of the unique natural , historical , social , and economic background of the population development in Tibet and its specific evolution process , Tibet 's Provisional Management Procedures on Family Planning stipulate : " Tibet pursues on a trial basis a principle of adherence to spreading propaganda on birth control , quality service , and voluntary choice . "  
constitutes a fundamental guiding ideology for China 's educational reform and development under the historical conditions of socialist market economic development , reform , and opening up ; serves as a guide to action for deepening educational reform and promoting quality education in an all-around manner ; and has great , practical significance as a guide as well as far-reaching historical significance .  
Though a myriad of contradictions have yet to be tackled and countless difficulties yet to be overcome in the historical process of national rejuvenation through science and education , so long as we forge ahead in face of difficulties and implement the party 's relevant policies in real earnest , our national rejuvenation through science and education is bound to dutifully accomplish its mission by creating new brilliance in the course of the Chinese nation 's great rejuvenation .  
It was precisely in this historical process that the CPC formed the CPPCC by integrating the united front theories of Marxism and Leninism with China 's specific practice .  It is a great creation and the fruit of long-term unity and struggle by the CPC along with all democratic parties , mass organizations , and the patriotic personages of all ethnic groups and all walks of life .  
The speech profoundly points out the existing problems and weak links in educational work , reflects Comrade Jiang Zemin 's great concern and care about education .  Not only the speech has realistic guiding significance on carrying out the Party 's educational policy in an all-round way and carrying forward our country 's education reform and development , but also will create profound historical influence .  
He said : Practice has proved that the establishment of a strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia is indeed a wise choice of historical significance [ li shi xing de zheng que jue ze 2980-0670-1840-4104-2973-4292-2115-2344 ] .  In the new millennium and the new century , the two sides should take a long view and become good neighbors , good partners , and good friends who trust each other , engage in cooperation , and pursue common development .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's remarks have , from a high plane of historical materialism , revealed the fundamental nature of our party ; pointed out the party 's basic tasks ; and are of an important theoretical and practical significance to our efforts to further maintain the advancement of the party , retain the vigor and vitality of the party , lead the whole party and the people of the entire country to carry out struggles in unity , and build our country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized modern socialist power .  
The historical experiences gained by our party in leading the socialist cause have proved , from both the positive and negative aspects , that whenever the party represents the development demands of advanced productive forces , our cause will flourish and grow ;  
Deputy Abdulahat Abdurixit , chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional People 's Government , stated : Large-scale development of western regions has offered ethnic minorities regions ' development with a historical opportunity unknown in the past , while a stable social environment is the prerequisite for large-scale development , for nothing could be accomplished without a stable social environment . 
Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy , there is an important question for reality and a theoretical question on strengthening the construction of the Party under the new historical conditions : How can our Party from beginning to end maintain its quality of being the vanguard of the working class , how can our Party better represent the necessities for the development of China advanced productive forces , how can our Party represent the development direction of China advanced cultures and how can our Party represent the broad masses interest  
He said : Sichuan Province will seize the historical opportunity brought by the state 's decision on adopting the strategy for great development in China 's west , and will strive to speed up the province 's development at a rate higher than the national average , thus realizing a new leap forward .  The per capita GDP of the province in 2005 will reach the national average level in 2000 ; and will catch up with the national average level in 2010 , thus becoming an economically strong province in the western region .  
The basic spirit of the speech is suited to the county ( or city ) level as well as to the leadership at various levels ; the speech is particularly aimed at improving the ideological and political qualities of leading cadres at various levels ; so it is of great practical and far-reaching historical significance .  
A responsible official of Chongqing Municipality indicated today that this municipality will seize the historical opportunity of extensively developing western regions to build itself into an economic center on the upper reaches of Chang Jiang and will , at the same time , adopt effective measures to ensure the smooth fulfillment of the task on relocating the residents at the Three Gorges reservoir areas .  
The initial stage refers to the historical stage in which the situation of the impoverished population accounting for a large proportion and the people 's living standards being comparatively low will be gradually changed so that the entire people will become comparatively prosperous .  
In socialist construction , areas inhabited by minority nationalities in our country have scored achievements attracting worldwide attention .  Owing to the limitations of natural conditions and for historical reasons , however , there is still a certain gap between the minority-nationality regions and the more developed inland and eastern coastal areas in the levels of economic and cultural development .  
Since the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee , we have worked to sum up historical experience , to carry out reform and opening , to concentrate on economic construction , thereby generating unprecedented development of the productive forces , tremendous improvement in comprehensive national capability , marked improvement in people 's lives , and comprehensive social progress .  
The important speech given by President Jiang at the Plenary Session of the PLA Representative Troops fully affirms the achievements made by the military and armed police troops and raises clear requirements for comprehensively promoting the construction of military modernization .  The speech emphasizes that the military must further clearly understand the historical mission it shoulders and provide firm and strong assurance of security for protecting the country 's sovereignty , unity and security , for protecting the people 's labor under peaceful conditions and for reform , opening up and the construction of socialist modernization .  
Only our Party has these important responsibilities .  Our military is the people 's military under the resolute leadership of the Party . Whether or not the military 's Party organizations are firm and strong , whether or not they can become firm fighting forces and whether or not they can play the role of the " Three Representations " are significant to whether or not we can solve the 2 historical tasks , " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's nature . "  
Leading cadres at all levels must fully understand the historical responsibilities they shoulder and strengthen their sense of concern of being prepared for danger in times of peace and their sense of their fundamental functions .  They must further strengthen their initiative and sense of urgency in their study and strive to study scientific theories and scientific and technological knowledge with a spirit of seizing every minute .  They must continuously heighten their political quality , theoretical level and ability in commanding modern wars .  
Particularly in the new historical period , our military is implementing a new period of military strategies and principles in a positive way , moving along the road of quality construction and of making the military strong with science and technology , and striving to complete two historical tasks of " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's quality . "  Deep changes are taking place in various aspects of military construction and new people , new events and new trends worthy of being recorded with letters of gold have emerged in large numbers .  
[ Shi Guangsheng ] Because of historical reasons and natural conditions , the economic foundation of the western region is quite weak .  The overall development level there is evidently much lower than that in the eastern region .  The gap between the two regions in the scale and level of the development of foreign trade and economic cooperation is also quite big .  
This should be of important theoretical and practical significance to our party under the new historical conditions in further strengthening self building , always maintaining advanced nature , leading the people of the whole country in waging concerted struggles , pushing forward reform and opening up and modernization building , and realizing the magnificent transcentury objectives .  
Under the new historical conditions , through summing up the historical experiences since the founding of the party , Comrade Jiang Zemin made a new , comprehensive , and complete epitome of the advanced nature of the party .  During the periods of revolution , construction , and reform , our party has always represented the development needs of advanced social productive forces in China , the forward direction of advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
The expositions of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has comprehensively revealed the historical connection between the correct leadership of the party and developing social productive forces , flourishing advanced culture , and realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
And in the new historical period only by maintaining and bringing into play this kind of advanced nature can our party continue pushing forward the emancipation and development of social productive forces , promoting the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of national economy , and eventually realizing the dream of making the country powerful .  
The reason for China needing a communist party and the reason for the communist party succeeding in mounting China 's social and political stage and displaying great historical roles is exactly because that the communist party can meet the needs of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture , and fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people in China .  
It has been proven by historical experiences that without the heartfelt endorsement and vigorous support of the broad masses of people , our Party could not possibly have developed from a weak and small beginning into a strong and large force and displayed decisive historical roles in putting an end to the situation of China being carved up by foreign powers and laboring people being oppressed and exploited by reactionary ruling classes and in the struggles of changing the look of poverty and backwardness in China .  
Meanwhile , under the new historical conditions we are required to comprehensively push forward the ideological , organizational , and stylistic building of the Party and truly maintain and display the advanced nature of the Party on the basis of correctly mastering and handling the relationship of dialectical unity between the advanced nature of ourselves and the extensiveness of our contacts with the masses .  
A pressing task of the moment for all local authorities in the western region is to remove administrative barriers as soon as possible , break up the structure of separating the markets between localities and trades , clear away all obstacles to market entry , and create a unified and open market environment for fair competition , thus grasping the new historical opportunity for the great development of the western region .  
Introducing able personnel from other parts of the country is , no doubt , a major channel ; yet it is more practical and more economical to arouse the potentialities of existing scientific and technological personnel inside the region .  Besides , the large-scale development of the western region has also provided a rare historical opportunity for the able personnel in the military industry to attain greater accomplishments in their career .  
This reporter has learned from the meeting that under the present circumstances wherein its economy still remains underdeveloped , China has succeeded , thanks to its hard efforts in recent years , in bringing an unduly fast population growth under effective control ; its total fertility rate among women of child-bearing age has dropped below the supersedure level ; and the country 's population reproduction mode has experienced a historical change to one of " low birthrate , low death rate , and low growth . "  
In the new historical period , our party must always meet the requirements in the development of the advanced social productive forces in China , adhere to the advancing orientation of China 's progressive culture , and faithfully represent the fundamental interests of the broadest majority of the Chinese people , and a basic and decisive condition for this is that the party must persistently arm the minds of the entire membership and rally the people with the correct ideal and belief .  
In the past , we won great victories in revolution and construction by overcoming tremendous difficulties and dangers , because our party persistently educated party members , guided the masses , united people 's minds , and boosted people 's morale with the lofty ideal and with the objectives for the struggle in every historical stage .  
The correct ideal and belief will not come into people 's minds from nothing .  It is based on the arming of people 's minds with the Marxist theory , and based on people 's clear understanding and correct mastery of the objective law that governs social historical development and the correct outlook on life under the guidance of the scientific theory .  
To be sure , Tibet 's falling behind by far the country 's average development standard is due to both historical and natural factors .  However , we must not lay the blame on objective factors alone .  After all we need to calmly and realistically analyze subjective and operational factors as well .  
All provinces and autonomous regions in the western region must conform their ideology and actions to the policy decisions and work arrangements of the central authorities .  Not only should they fully understand and firmly grasp this rare historical opportunity , enhance their sense of urgency and mission , meet difficulties head-on , and forge ahead with vigorous efforts ; but they should also see clearly that the development gap in the western region is a result of historical reasons formed over a long period of time ;  
The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee decided to shift the focus of the party 's work onto economic development .  This correctly grasped the main contradiction in the initial stage of socialism , and was a significant political decision on fulfilling the party 's historical mission and building ours into a powerful socialist country .  
Chen Yaobang said : Due to various reasons , such as natural and historical reasons , agricultural and rural economic developments in the western region have been lagging behind and the average per capita income of peasants is quite low .  
The people from the eastern , central , and western regions have reached a consensus : The grand western development is not only a historical turning point for the people of the western region to rouse themselves to catch up with the developed region and narrow the gap between them , but also a huge space for the eastern region to further its prosperity and development .  It is a common opportunity for both the eastern and western regions in China .  
This is a historical event in the north-south relations since the split on the Korean Peninsula 55 years ago .  As a new bright spot for the south and the north to head toward peace , reconciliation and cooperation , the meeting is welcome and worth being supported .  
At the same time , while protecting the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups , the governments must respect the universal principle concerning human rights acknowledged by the international community and also have the right to adopt measures that commensurate with their own national conditions in the light of their own realities because historical background , cultural tradition , development level , and nationality composition vary from country to country .  
The 15th National Party Congress has formulated the strategic program of gearing the construction of a socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century .  The completion of this new historical task depends on the leading groups and the leading cadres at all levels , on the continuous upgrading of their leadership standard and government standard , and on the continuous strengthening of their ability to resist corruption and degeneration , and on their work to further solidify the party and the people , so that together we can struggle to move forward with our grand undertaking .  
After the Cold War , peace and development have become major topics that are of common concern to peoples of all nations in the world .  In this situation , Japan has not made more contributions to world peace and development , but has instead used all its armed might to indulge in wars of aggression , expanded its armament without restraint , and attempted to elevate its international status and political and economic interests as a military power .  This obviously runs counter to the historical trend .  
Using network resources and conducting research on the question of launching a people 's war on the net are of strong practical significance in making good preparations for military struggle .  In addition , they are also of profound and far-reaching historical significance in developing the strategic ideology of launching people 's war .  
Zhang Lichang , secretary of the municipal party committee , said that leading cadres at all levels must stand at the high plain of historical development to fully understand the urgency of implementing the important concept of " three represents " in close connection with the profound changes in the domestic and international situation and with the actual conditions of Tianjin 's work , further emancipate people 's minds , further break new ground and make new progress , grasp opportunities , and develop by leaps and bounds .  
As we all know , the founders of Marxism always approached the revolutionary spirit , the historical mission , and the source of strength of both the proletariat and their political parties in different countries from the angle of their relationship with the emergence and development of socialized productive forces represented by the big industry in both modern and contemporary times .  
The advancedness of our party is rooted in the historical position of China 's working class which represents the development demands of the social productive forces of our time ; and which is tempered , cultivated , and formed in the protracted struggle .  
Obviously , such an advancedness is not an abstract concept ; but has been given an historical , concrete , and comprehensive expression by the " three represents , " in other words , by the theories , programs , policies , and practices in the three aspects of representing the development demands of China 's advanced social productive forces , the orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the vast numbers of the people .  
Only when our party leads and brings along the masses to fulfill the historical mission of " three represents " in real terms amidst social changes and social progresses can it be able to keep to the correct orientation of the party building ; and can it improve its own quality , consolidate its organizational building , and enhance its fighting capacity during the process of playing a dynamic role in transforming the objective world and in pushing forward social progress .  
Leading cadres at all levels must arm themselves fully with Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important exposition ; willingly enhance their sense of historical responsibility and urgency ; broaden their horizons ; work hard and keep forging ahead ; foster a scientific spirit ; master scientific methods ; learn knowledge about science ; and persist in working hard unremittingly on the basis of what has been achieved so far .  They must make efforts to further improve their ideological and cultural quality ;  
Wang Ke pointed out : The important speech , which Chairman Jiang made from a strategic height and after having reviewed the whole situation , is a scientific summation of our party 's historical experience , a deep revelation of the inherent laws governing the work of party building , and an enrichment and development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's thoughts on party building .  It has further pointed out the direction of party building in the new period and has a high theoretical and ideological level and a guiding function .  
He revised the draft resolution over and over again , wrote such important sections as the " Cultural Revolution " by himself , fully implemented what was demanded by the second-generation leading collective with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the core , seriously summed up the historical experience , correctly evaluated Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought , and made a major contribution to reaching a Party-wide common understanding .  
Nevertheless , Taiwan , being a typical hilly island and surrounded by the sea , is narrow in space and lacks strategic depth .  Crowded with 23-million people , the 36,000 square kilometer island is absolutely unable to resist forced entry by a power .  At the moment , the Taiwan authorities are going against the historical trend .  
The important concept of " three represents " put forward by General Secretary Jiang is an in-depth summing-up of historical experiences in the building of our party , a scientific generalization of the party 's nature , aims , and tasks , and new requirements set for party building in the new period .  It embodies the distinct characteristics of the times and is of profound ideological and scientific guiding significance .  
During our major political struggle against " Falun Gong , " some veteran comrades who had been party members for many years were confused by its false reasoning and heresy .  This fact profoundly shows that in new historical conditions , the struggle between right and wrong , between the advanced and the backward , between science and superstition , and between civilization and ignorance in the ideological sphere appears to be ever more complicated .  
We must regard the study and implementation of this important thinking a fundamental approach to and a long-term strategic mission for enhancing party organizations ' cohesion and combat strength , for ensuring the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and for accomplishing the two historical tasks of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration . "  We must make unremitting efforts to study and implement this important thinking so as to improve party building in the armed forces and raise the standards of military construction in all areas .  
In the march toward the new century , in order to conscientiously implement Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement on the " three represents " and " comprehensively advance party building around the two major historical topics , that is , constantly raising our leading and governing ability and improving our ability to guard against corruption and degeneration and withstand risks , " it is necessary to thoroughly implement the principle of strictly administering the party and satisfactorily resolve the ideological , organizational , and work style problems that exist in our party .  
In the great tide of world peace and development , the historical handshake of the Korean peninsula 's leaders from the north and south not only broke through the solid ice and opened the road for the Korean nation 's independent [ zizhu ] peaceful unification , it also created a beneficial environment and conditions for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula , in the northeast Asian region , and the world .  
Practice in the three major political struggles showed : The mission of ideological and political construction in the army under the new historical condition , as proposed by the All-Army Political Work Conference , is of extreme significance to providing a powerful spiritual motivation for " winning our fight " , and to providing a reliable political guarantee for " not deteriorating " .  
Faced with the new situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and high technology is being applied extensively in the military field , our army should train a large number of new-type military personnel who are militarily and politically competent and who have acquired good command of modern scientific and cultural knowledge .  This is the key for our army to gain the initiative in future military struggles and shoulder the historical missions entrusted by the party and the people .  
This theme defined at the turn of the century has expressed the strong desire of the people nationwide for treasuring the land and protecting the cultivated land at the historical moment when they are marching toward the new century .  It is also the historical choice of the Chinese nation in order to survive and multiply and to grow and flourish .  
Owing to various factors , such as historical and geographic conditions , most of our country 's key economic bases are distributed in economically developed coastal areas , areas with transport facilities , and large and medium-sized inland cities .  Thus , it will be easy for enemies to destroy in a concentrated manner our closely distributed economic bases .  
The CPC unites and leads the entire people of all nationalities throughout the country to carry out dauntless struggle .  The party dedicated numerous outstanding members , and eventually defeated imperialist aggressors , overthrew the " three big mountains " on the backs of the Chinese people , and opened up a new historical era in which the Chinese people are masters of their own country and independently develop socialism .  
The protracted nature of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that it will take a process of considerably long historical struggle to achieve the grand objective of socialist modernization and it is not plain sailing because many difficulties and problems will crop up in the course of our advance .  
In particular , during the magnificent 20th century , the people of Asia were indomitable in going all out to make their countries strong , composing a magnificent historical epic of their political awakening and economic upsurge and giving a powerful impetus to historical progress and social development .  
The ossified " Soviet model " took the experience and development course of socialist construction under a special historical condition as something absolute and sacred without regard to the need to make continuous innovations inside socialism across different stages of development .  As a result , this seriously hindered the development of productivity , made it impossible to improve the people 's living conditions over a long time , and went against the requirements determined by the nature of socialism .  
The thinking of persisting in the " three represents " under the new historical conditions has clearly defined the political direction , political standard , and political requirement for the building of our military ; and is of an extremely important and far-reaching significance to strengthening the party 's ideological leadership , political leadership , and organizational leadership over the military , and to ensuring that our military can forever march forward under the banner of the party and can always retain the nature and the aim of a people 's military .  
To make it simple , that is to " ensure the correct direction and to produce skilled students " .  This task is based on basic requirements and the historical mission that Chairman Jiang imposed on military schools for ideological and political construction in the new stage .  
Especially when we face the corrosion and influence of false ideas prevailing in society , constant adjustments in the relationships of public interests and the urgent task of preparing for military struggles , we should find an answer to and resolve the historical issues of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " and should have new and more demanding standards for implementation of the " program " and for the strengthening of grassroots construction .  
We soon had an interview with Che Guevara , and obtained a lot of inside information from Carlos Rafael Rodriguez , head of the daily newspaper Hoy . Confined by objective historical conditions and delicate and complicated international relations , however , we found that many of the questions could not be reported openly .  
Reform and opening up is a historical policy decision determining the fate of contemporary China . This great practice has not only greatly liberated and developed productive forces , but also greatly emancipated people 's minds , deeply transformed the mental outlook of the masses of people , and promoted the constant progress of social thinking .  
Over the last 20 years or so , the broad masses of the people have emancipated their minds and acted on an unprecedented historical initiative and proceeded from a highly developed sense of responsibility for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation to offer ideas and contribute methods for the reform and opening up and undertakings of modernization drive and actively study new situations and resolve new issues in the light of the actual conditions .  
At the time of great social changes taking place and during a special historical era of moving from a closed society to an opened society , people should experience bigger fluctuations in ideology and mentality .  They might feel confused and incomprehensible about the new social phenomena which are constantly emerging or even make deviations and errors in understanding .  All these should eventually be resolved in practice through relying on the self-education of the masses .  
This requires that creators of literary and artistic works should persistently focus on realistic topics when choosing between historical and realistic ones , and focus on military-oriented topics when choosing between military-oriented topics and non-military ones .  These creators should be enthusiastically concerned about the great process of military construction , firmly take the pulse of life in military camps , and make our excellent spiritual products the satisfactory guide in creating literary and artistic works .  
During the period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , the historical opportunity of expanding domestic demands and implementing active financial policies was seized .  Through issuing national debt and expanding investments , we have concentrated efforts to build a batch of major projects and fulfilled some big projects which we had always wanted to fulfill but failed .  The agricultural , forestry , and water conservancy construction has noticeably quickened .  
The people are relieved to see that with the convocation of the UN millennium summit and the " Chinese Cultural Exhibition in the United States " , as well as the large-scale cultural exchange activities which are being held in the United States nationwide like a raging fire , the main US media , including the " New York Times " and the " Washington Post " , have " broken historical records " in frequently reporting on China 's relevant situations .  
The Chinese people made arduous exploration for half a century to go through this process .  They achieved major successes , and they had also experienced many twists and turns or even paid high prices before they could basically accomplish at last an organic integration of the universality and particularity of socialism under new historical conditions , and begin to figure out the right path of socialist development that suits China 's national conditions .  
On the one hand , we firmly retained many practices that were not socialist ones but restraints to development of the productive forces , or those which were only applicable to certain special historical conditions .  We claimed such practices to be " socialist principles " , but actually they were not .  On the other hand , we mistook for " capitalist practices " many things that were conducive to the development of productive forces under socialist conditions , and so we repudiated them .  
The people 's democratic dictatorship as a form of state and the people 's congress system as a form of government of what our country has been pursuing are the result of the people 's struggle and a historical choice made by the people .  They are the corner stone of our country 's political system which not only suits our country 's national conditions but also reflects the substantive requirements of socialism .  
As theoretical workers of socialist countries , we should conscientiously sum up the experience left over by the practice and exploration of socialism in the 20th century .  We should take the summarization of this rich theoretical heritage as our solemn historical mission , make our unique contributions to upholding and developing Marxism , and thus provide a better guidance to practice and exploration of socialism in the 21st century .  
However , the Vatican has turned black into white by " canonizing " these sinners , who had a notorious record , in an attempt to reverse the historical fact of the imperialist aggression against China . This act has severely hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and is intolerable to every religious believer who loves his country .  
In the long years of revolutionary war and socialist construction , especially at important historical junctures , he firmly supported the party 's correct leadership and steadfastly implemented the party 's line , principles , and policies , demonstrating a Communist 's steadfast faith in communism and noble revolutionary quality .  
In this way , they have effectively solved the difficult problem of insufficient sustained supporting strength for the airborne troops , and the airborne troops now have reliable " mobile warehouses " .  This indicates the airborne troops have taken a historical leap forward from being able to air-drop troops alone to being able to conduct combined operations .  
The flames of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea disappeared nearly 50 years ago .  Unprecedented changes have taken place in the international political structure and the world military arena .  However , the valuable experience gained from this war cuts through space-time , exceeds national boundaries , and becomes an extensive and precious historical textbook .  
Now , the initial form of socialist market economy has been established , but the historical mission of social system transition remains to be completed .  For example , some enterprises are still unable to meet the development demands of market economy , the operating mechanism is not active , the capability for technical innovation is not strong ;  
These three friendly neighboring countries all possess tropical or subtropical scenery , folk customs and ways which are different from China 's , brilliant and splendid civilizations , and numerous historical stories and legends about their friendly intercourse with China .  
At the Party Central Committee 's conference on ideological and political work , Comrade Jiang Zemin noted that , " to do the ideological and political work well in the new period , we must profoundly analyze both the objective environment and the characteristics of the thinking of the larger number of cadres and the masses in the new situation from international , domestic , historical and realistic perspectives .  We must correctly examine and solve significant problems in both theory and reality that are influential to the thinking of cadres and the masses .  
This important directive was made from a long-term and broad perspective , through both dialectical materialism and historical materialism , and with an eye on the requirements for the development of the times .  This directive has set the direction for strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new period .  
Both the north and the south have made firm steps toward the relaxation of tension and reconciliation on the peninsula .  Viewed from an historical angle , this is just the beginning of the long road toward peaceful reunification .  With the trend of easing tension and the acceleration in cooperation and exchange , the " agreement on truce " signed during the Cold War period can no longer meet the development and changes of the big trend in the international arena .  
From this we can see that thoroughgoingly criticizing the reactionary " historical concept of being a nation of divinity , " eliminating the pernicious influence of the pre-war education that deified Mikado , rooting out the hotbed of militarism once and for all , and gaining a correct understanding of the development history and culture of the Japanese nation is key to ensuring that Japan , which has already become an economic power , will always follow a path of peaceful development and will be accepted by its neighboring countries and by the vast numbers of Asian nations .  
Even though the socialist movement experienced grave setbacks , its banner was still flying high above the Earth . These are not random historical phenomena but a vivid embodiment of an objective regularity of social development .  
With the passage of time , the sequence of historical evolution became even more discernible , and the inevitable occurrence of this historical phenomenon became even clearer : first , the development of capitalism got all countries involved in the capitalist system , and as developed capitalist countries were engaged in the export of commodities and capital , they at the same time exported their internal contradictions , the human suffering brought along by capitalism .  
At the same time , understanding and mastering these laws is a process where subjective and objective factors converge .  In reality , this convergence frequently has experienced the interference and impact of various factors .  That is why mastering the laws of the building of socialism takes repeated exploration and experimentation and is a historical process that is sure to be prolonged and complicated .  
Holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping theory , continuing to step up the building of democracy and the legal system , and building China into a country ruled by law having a high degree of socialist democracy and a sound socialist legal system , are an important assurance for the Chinese nation to realize the grand goal of rejuvenation , as well as an important contribution of the Chinese nation to mankind 's historical progress .  
Some Western capitalist countries are trying to bring the process of historical development in the world onto the path they design by making use of the increasingly frequent and close international relations and exchanges and by making use of their political , economic , scientific , technological , and military advantages .  
In the current international circumstances which are undergoing profound changes , while concentrating our strength on advancing the modernization drive and continuing to open up to the outside world , we must keep ourselves sober-headed against the infiltration of the Western ideology .  An important thing we should do is to persistently apply the dialectical materialist and historical materialist point of view to observe the complicated social phenomena .  
Therefore , the military is facing considerable arduous tasks and many obvious difficulties : the military construction and development lack sufficient funds and their weaponry and armament are still yet to be modernized ; the military also faces great changes in its historical , social and objective environments ; the quality of military professionals is far from meeting the requirements for the modernization construction ;  
We should excel at understanding historical development trends and walk on the cutting edge of the times .  We should also be skillful in basing everything in reality , formulating the correct policies and strategies for development and be consistently innovative in theory , systems , science and technology in order to develop every project in modernization construction in a health , fast and sustainable way in the new century .  
During the 20th century which has just passed , scientific and technological progress brought about unprecedented development to the civilization of mankind .  Today , the Chinese nation is faced with a historical opportunity of comprehensive rejuvenation ; and the realization of a peaceful reunification across the strait is an inexorable demand of cross-strait economic , social , and cultural development .  We hope that the leaders of the Taiwan authorities can face up to the reality ; comply with the historical trend of the time ;  
Despite Li Hongzhi 's wild boasting and loud preaching about the series of absurd beliefs that he has created , facts speak louder than words .  In the light of dialectical materialism and historical materialism , his reactionary and decadent nature is abundantly clear .  
refining and distilling the ruling party 's " governing " policy and historical mission of developing productive forces and culture and realizing the people 's interests in such a way as to make them the ruling party 's fundamental guiding principle on " administering the party " has answered the important historical questions of " what kind of party we should build and how we should build our party " ; all this has raised Marxist party building theory to a higher level .  
But , we should also realize that any fundamental , continual social and historical change is always accompanied by interactions between the mainstream and the tributaries , struggles between the positive and negative sides and between the progressive and backward sides , and influence and constraints from various internal and external factors , resulting a situation of unprecedented diversity and complexity .  
Countless Party members and revolutionary military professionals would dedicate everything in them to liberating the Chinese nation , bringing happiness to the people and revitalizing the country .  The reform , opening up and the development of the socialist market economy have added enormous vitality and historical progress to our construction of material and spiritual civilizations .  
To satisfactorily answer and solve the historical topics of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " in the new situation , our military must construct all grassroots units including " small , remote , scattered and directly administered " units into strong fighting groups .  
Western countries headed by the United States always draw an ideological line by only recognizing western value standards and human rights concepts , and they want every country to completely copy their ways , irrespective of their historical traditions and level of social and economic development .  This has already caused social turmoil and even war in certain African countries .  
Since the 20 years of reform and opening up , we have attached prime importance to people 's right of existence in accordance with China 's national conditions , succeeded in realizing two historical leaps - - moving from poverty to having enough food and clothing and then to leading a comparatively comfortable life , and achieved comprehensive economic and social development .  World-shaking changes have taken place in China 's human rights situation , and China has been generally praised by the international community for these changes .  
Deputies Shi Yuxiao and Zhang Guochu held that today , facing the new task of regarding economic construction as the central task , the important thinking of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has given a highly refined interpretation in fundamentally answering the questions of how to build the party , what kind of party to build , and how to act well as the " force at the core " in leading the cause of socialist modernization in the new historical conditions .  
The good situation has been pioneered by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the party .  The ideological and political foundation , the material and technical foundation , and the mass foundation , that we have already possessed to realize the three major historical tasks in the new situation , have been laid by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the party .  
Thereby , the key to consolidating and developing the current gratifying situation , realizing objectives in the Outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , and fulfilling the three major historical tasks in the new century hinges on further implementing the important thinking of the " three represents " as put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin . Besides , the party should achieve its ideological and organizational construction , improve its work styles , and ceaselessly improve its leadership , its ruling level , and its capability of resisting corruption and preventing peaceful evolution .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin has scientifically summed up the historical experiences of the world socialist movement and of our party in leading the Chinese revolution and construction , and creatively put forward the important thinking on " three represents , " thus answering in scientific fashion a series of major issues that we face in stepping up party building in the new situation .  
Deputies pledged to carry forward the spirit of incessant struggle advocated by President Jiang , have a high sense of political and historical responsibility , strengthen army building in an all-round way , and score good results in the two historical subjects of " winning the battle " and " never changing color " .  
Deputy Chen Jinbiao noted : Under the present new historical conditions , to judge whether the building of party organizations in the military has been reinforced , our ultimate criterion is to see whether the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the party organizations at all levels have been reinforced ; and whether the role of party committees as a leading core , the role of party branches as a powerful fighting force , and the exemplary vanguard role of party members have all been brought into full play .  
The aforementioned three criteria can more or less provide a basic yardstick for the general public who are concerned with things of this category ; and if we view the matter against a more extensive historical background , we can see that orthodox religions also showed a number of imperfect factors down the ages .  
Political restructuring and the development of the socialist democracy and political system must be conducive to maintaining and giving play to the features and advantages of our political system , and conducive to maintaining the unity of the country , ethnic unity and social stability .  In addition , the historical conditions and the level of economic , cultural and educational development must also be taken into full consideration .  
While entering into the new historical era , Chairman Jiang showed great foresight and stood on the high altitude of strategy and overall situation to have put forth the general requirements of five phrases of " being up to standard in politics , perfect in mastering military skills , excellent in work styles , highly disciplined , and effective in safeguard " , which has clearly pointed out the forward direction for strengthening the all-round grass-roots building .  
It is necessary to act according to the requirements of the " three represents " to earnestly study and resolve the new situations and new issues encountered in the building of party organizations under the new historical condition of reform and opening up and developing the socialist market economy and conduct education for maintaining the advanced nature of the party with targets in mind , so as to let party branches at grass-roots level possess very strong capability in directing the overall building of companies and resolving their own problems and party member truly display an exemplary role .  
We have discussed , from a theoretical and historical perspective , the great importance of social and intellectual differentiation resulting from China 's economic reform led by the political authorities to China 's future political democratization ; however , it must also be pointed out that the inherent defects in a post-totalitarian system and reformist model have also created a series of difficulties .  
However , at the initial stage of socialism , with the distinct characteristics of dual economic structures for the villages and the cities , and with deeply-settled historical and cultural traditions involving small-scale peasant economies in the villages , the cultural and technology quality of the peasants has remained low and many peasants do not understand or are not accustomed to the market economy .  
Through agreat historical change , China thoroughly terminated its miserable history ofbeing victimized by foreign aggression and becoming weak and poor , and beganthe new process of making the people rich and making the nation strong .  
International public opinion has focused on the fact that in this book approved by the Japanese Government , the " New History Textbook Writing Committee " has , under the slogan of making some " corrections to Japanese history textbooks ' tendency toward national abuse , " distorted historical facts and completely whitewashed its invasive war , denying the serious crimes that Japan committed during World War II . Although the manuscript was revised 137 times , its contents are still far from historical fact .  
In the 1982 and 1986 revisions to history textbooks , which twisted the facts and beautified aggressive warfare , a wave of opposition was stirred up both in Asian nations and within Japan . The Japanese press was somewhat more sensitive in their assessment of the textbook , immediately reporting that the new History Textbook Committee had used the excuse that there was national abuse in the existing middle school history textbooks to lead in writing a prettified history textbook which glorifies an imperialist historical view .  
Fu Quanyou expounded the development process and historical causes of the world 's new military revolution , analyzed the essential features and profound impact of the revolution , and explicitly put forth our Army 's major counter measures to meet the challenges from the world 's new military revolution .  
Different countries differ not only in their geographical location but also in their level of economic development and historical and cultural traditions .  Thus , they are bound to have different political , economic and social systems , and it is unrealistic to achieve unification using one and the same model .  
The " three advantages " criterion constitutes the standard for us to judge all our work in carrying out China 's reform and opening-up program and developing the socialist modernization drive .  In this way , the thinking on " three represents " helps set the goals for party building in the new period , and expand the historical mission of the Communist Party of China in the new period .  It also provides a theoretical guidance to the ruling party for further strengthening its cultural , social , and economic foundations .  
Due to the constraints of historical and geographical factors , the level of economic and social development in some areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups is comparatively backward .  
The entire process of the incident was connected to historical , legal , cultural , language , and religious issues , and the only thing that was conspicuously absent was its military aspect .  US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did not even appear in public during the development of the incident .  It was not until 13 April that he held a news conference at which he complained that it was only the Chinese Communist plane 's provocative act that was the underlying cause of the collision .  
Jiang Zemin said : Venezuela is a country with beautiful mountains and rivers and rich natural resources .  The diligent and courageous Venezuelan people are endowed with glorious historical traditions .  At present , under the leadership of President Chavez , the Venezuelan Government and people are making vigorous efforts to push forward political , economic , and social reform ;  
When new China was established , for historical reasons the mother mainland laid particular stress on putting politics in command and emphasized ideology ; it violated the laws of economic development , and in particular this went to extremes during the " 10-year cultural revolution , " causing great damage to the social productive forces and bringing the national economy to the brink of bankruptcy . 
Li Zhaoxing finally said : President Jiang 's visit to Latin America is one of historical significance , for it has forcefully furthered the Sino-Latin American friendly cooperation in an all-round way in the new century ; has expanded China 's influence in the world ; and is of vital significance and far-reaching influence to enhancing unity and cooperation among the broad masses of developing countries and to facilitating the establishment of new , fair , and reasonable political and economic order in the world .  
Hu Jintao said : Since its founding , the Communist Party of Vietnam has always adhered to and upheld Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chih Ming Thought , maintained the leadership of the Communist Party , firmly kept to the path of socialism , triumphantly realized national liberation and reunification , scored remarkable achievements in socialist construction , especially in the cause of reform over the past 15 years , and led the Vietnamese people into a new historical period of building an industrialized and modernized country .  
We must strengthen our building of leadership teams , keep our objectives firmly in mind , strengthen Party spirit , consider the situation as a whole , unite closely , fulfill promises , strive to implement the Party line , have an effective and strong ideological level , political awareness and professional capability , building a strong leadership collective capable of bearing its historical responsibility .  
The large body of young writers keep in step with the times , pay close attention to reality , engage themselves in the practices of the masses , devote themselves to literary creation , present numerous excellent works with both the flavor of the times and historical substance , as well as with definite ideological depth and artistic appeal .  
The Chinese working class is indeed the representative of advanced social productive forces and production relations , is indeed the basic driving force that promotes social development and historical advances , is indeed the main force in the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization , and is indeed the leading class of the people 's republic .  
We must always adhere to the Marxist viewpoint of historical materialism , firmly adopt the basic viewpoint that only people are the driving force for creating history , give wider publicity to the need to further enhance the status and role of the working class , greatly carry forward the great contemporary spirit of the working class , use the advanced ideas and model conduct of the working class to influence and lead all other sectors of our society , continuously consolidate and enhance the master status of the broad working masses .  
Meanwhile , the book must also make a comprehensive , profound , and accurate summarization of the historical experiences and lessons that our army has gained and learned from its building , so as to serve as an important historical reference in the course of strengthening national defense , promoting army building , and making sound preparations for military struggles .  
Chi Haotian urged the compilers of the military history to ensure a sound quality for the entire book by taking the attitude of holding themselves responsible for history , the party , the people , the officers and men , and for the revolutionaries of the older generation ; and to make sure that the military history they are compiling is a faithful historical account , as well as an accurate " Historical Record , " of our army that can be handed down to future generations .  
Putin emphasized : President Jiang Zemin 's visit to Russia is a major event in Russian-Chinese relations this year ; and it has extremely important practical and historical significance .  I am very delighted to be able to have a thorough exchange of views with President Jiang on ways to continuously enrich and deepen the strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries , and to promote and strengthen bilateral cooperation in world affairs in the coming century .  
The Taiwan leader , however , disregarding the historical fact and the universal demand of the compatriots on both sides of the strait , has fabricated the " 1992 spirit " of " a consensus that is devoid of consensus " and the so-called " setting aside the controversial dialogue and exchange , " in an attempt to negate and change the existing foundation of the two organizations ' talks and to set up a serious roadblock to the cross-strait talks .  
A correct understanding of the strategic developments and changes under the new historical conditions , a scientific strategic outlook , and , in particular , a broader and more profound strategic vision and more enterprising strategic thinking are indispensable to understanding the basic trend of strategic developments .  
While seizing the historical opportunities and concentrating strength on advancing modernization , we must also be soberly aware that the contemporary world is still not peaceful though the situation is easing on the whole , and the parity of international strength is seriously imbalanced .  Hegemonism and power politics still exist and make new developments in the fields of international politics , economy , and security .  Military interventionism has further increased .  
While trying to seize the historical opportunities and concentrating resources on modernization , we must also be soberly aware that though the current world situation is moving toward relaxation on the whole , this planet is far from being peaceful ; there is a serious imbalance in international forces ; hegemonism and power politics are still existing and have gained fresh ground in international political , economic , and security domains ;  
Now facing the 21st century , we must adhere to the theme of development , focus on economic construction as the central task unswervingly , work hard to realize the " four modernizations , " and accomplish the historical mission of the great renaissance of the Chinese nation .  To achieve this grand goal , we must make energetic efforts to improve the basic quality of the whole people .  
The Dalai 's destruction of Tibetan-sect Buddhism also finds conspicuous expression in the fact that he has openly violated the established historical practice and religious rules and obstructed and undermined the work of locating and deciding on the reincarnated soul boy of the 10th Panchen by presumptuously announcing from abroad the ceincarnated soul boy of the Panchen , ?  
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi commented today at a press conference that China is carrying out a peaceful policy of foreign diplomacy in which independence and initiative is maintained .  This will aid in protecting and advancing peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region as well as in the world .  No matter how military planning is strengthened , advocacy of containment of China is contrary to the historical trend and is entirely wrong and will get nowhere .  
Compelled by public opinion at home and abroad , the textbook that in April had been determined to be " up to standard " by the Japanese Ministry for Education , Culture , Sports , Science , and Technology , had several thousand errors revised recently .  However , the revision avoided the important and dwelled on the trivial .  Descriptions that distort history and beautify aggression have not been revised , and the textbook still adopts the basic theme of advocating the " historical view of the Japanese Empire . "  
With the full support of Internet technology , the website has adopted an advanced databank structure and developed the function of multiple search , thus ensuring on-line audiovisual broadcast of an increased amount of pictures and precious historical materials , whose pictures and texts look excellent .  
However , this writer is of the opinion that the United States ' current military deployment in the Asia-Pacific region still is in a kind of historical continuation status - - there have not been any major changes in terms of quantity and quality .  Whether or not the United States will continue to adopt a " Cold War Forward Strategy " in its new strategic plan and step up its direct military presence around China are yet to be observed and studied .  
Li Liguo noted : On 23 May 1951 , the Central People 's Government and the former local government of Tibet signed a 17-clause " Agreement on Procedures Concerning the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet " ; and the People 's Liberation Army entered Tibet , drove out imperialist forces , and brought true both the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the unification of the mainland motherland .  This was a major event in China 's modern and contemporary history , and a natural and epoch-making turning point in the historical development of Tibet .  
While intensifying the aversion of most countries in the world to varying degrees , the so-called " unilateralism , " which is criticized by many countries , has also prompted many people of insight in the world to begin pondering numerous profound and lasting historical philosophic , political , and cultural issues , such as that in the new century , how different countries , different systems , and different cultures should make use of each other 's strong points for reference and respect each other ;  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , under the leadership of the CPC , people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet created a socialist miracle on the ruins of a feudal serfdom and successfully achieved the historical leap forward to socialism .  At the time of the peaceful liberation , the central authorities decided to temporarily retain Tibet 's old social system .  
Lenin said : " Only by being armed with all human knowledge can one become a communist . "  Only the new type of military personnel armed with all human knowledge , especially modern high-science and - technology knowledge , can accomplish our military 's historical mission of prevailing on the battlefield and remaining unchanged in nature .  
Both ordinary people and politicians have joined their ranks .  As far as the forms and nature of their activities are concerned , the post-war Japanese rightwing forces are quite similar to the pre-war ones .  They conduct terrorist activities , plot military coup d'etat , suppress progressive forces , strangle the freedom of speech , spare no effort to deny the history of invading China , adhere to the historical point of view of a kingdom , and advocate nationalism .  
Reviewing the spirit of struggle of our party in the Jinggangshan period along with the valuable historical experiences and excellent revolutionary traditions formed in the struggle has strong significance for the current strengthening of party building and the party 's close link with the masses .  
For example , they were related to such issues as reforming the housing system , reforming tertiary education , developing cultural industry , rebuilding old and dilapidated houses and buildings , and protecting historical cultural relics and legacies .  At the same time , the municipal party committee and government also set up a briefing system and arrange high-level and small-scope heart-to-heart talks .  
When looking at it from the point of view of the historical development of various " religious sects " , new and developing religious sects become discontented with the rigidity of the organizational system and break off from the mother religion .  Their leaders put forward the enlightenment of a special divinity and call on the minority of the followers .  This early developmental stage is inevitably looked upon by the mainstream as " heretical " .  
We should closely associate with the domestic and international situation , military construction and the ideological reality of every individual person .  We should inspect ourselves in accordance with the requirements of the " three represents " , profoundly consider and effectively understand the essence and internal relations of the " three represents " .  We must thoroughly understand the historical background and the era-oriented significance of the " three represents " .  
Under new historical conditions and due to the complicated and multi-faceted duties of our various military units in future anti-aggression war , we must abandon the traditional concept of " resisting and attacking enemies face-to-face " in our research and thoroughly study strong opponents who are capable of fighting a high-tech war .  
As noted in " The Decision on the Party 's Few Historical Issues Since the Founding of New China " , " Generally speaking , having relatively successfully conducted such a complex , difficult and profound social revolution in such a large country with hundreds of millions of people and having accelerated the development of the national economy including agriculture and industry is really a great historical victory " .  
The development and change of the post-Cold War international security situation shows that apart from cooperative security mechanism , the other mechanisms have not played or will also impossibly play , in the real terms , the role as patron saint in regional security , because the security based on those mechanisms is built on the basis of the others ' insecurity and is the refurbished version of the historical old security mechanism with hegemonist coloration .  
It is necessary to pay great attention to the management of scenic spots .  Houses should not be built at random in the vicinity of scenic spots .  Much less should cultural sites of historical interest be damaged or destroyed to build vulgar public places of entertainment .  
This means that the " Shanghai Five " mechanism will undergo a historical change from being a meeting mechanism to being a regional multilateral cooperation mechanism .  With the " Shanghai Five " mechanism substantiated and enhanced , it will play a greater role in and have a greater effect on speeding up the world 's multi-polarization process and building a just and reasonable international political and economic order .  
He spoke highly of the important role of the corps in production , construction , consolidating frontier defense , maintaining stability , and promoting ethnic solidarity , and encouraged its members to keep firmly in mind the heavy tasks entrusted them by the party and the people , further increase their sense of the historical mission and political responsibility of defending the border area and doing farm work there , and give full play to their role of a mainstay in promoting Xinjiang 's economic and social development and maintaining Xinjiang 's stability .  
In line with the work arrangements of the Central Military Commission and the PLA General Political Department , all major units of the PLA have engaged in theoretical studies ; carried out discussions and exchanged experiences ; and have enhanced their sense of responsibility and sense of mission in running well the education activity in close connection with the historical experiences that our party has gained in carrying out its struggle in unity over the past 80 years , and with the complex developments in the present situation of struggle both inside and outside the country .  
Particular efforts should be devoted to meticulously studying Chairman Jiang 's expositions on how we should understand the historical progress of development of socialist society , how we should understand historical progress of the development of capitalist society , how we should understand the influence on people 's thinking exerted by our practice of socialist reform and how we should understand the impact of the current international environment and international political struggles .  These expositions should be regarded as the guiding principle and fundamental basis for observing and understanding the international and domestic situation .  
and it played an important role in consolidating people 's democratic dictatorship , and in pushing forward the historical process of socialist revolution and construction in China .  With the arrival of the new historical period , the China Democratic League has showed its firm support for the line , principles , and policies that the CPC has adopted ever since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee ; conscientiously performed its role as a party participating in government and political affairs ;  
At the moment of commemorating the 80th anniversary of the party 's founding , we should seriously sum up the historical achievements of the united front and more profoundly understand its development regularity and historic mission .  This is of great significance for further consolidating and developing the most extensive patriotic united front and make it better serve the fulfillment of the three major tasks of the party and the state in the new century .  
He pointed out that the fundamental reason why the CPC has been able during its 80-year career to unite and lead the people of all nationalities throughout the country to win victory after victory and overcome one danger and obstacle after another is that we have consistently integrated the basic principles of Marxism with China 's specific reality , and have continually explored and upheld the correct road for advance suited to China 's realities in every historical period of revolution , construction , and reform .  
Keeping in mind the historical lesson learned from being overanxious to move toward communism , as well as the historical setback in the last decade of the previous century in the form of the disintegration of the Soviet Union , which was the first socialist country , CPC members are prepared to struggle in a down-to-earth manner for at least another 50 years for socialism in the initial stage and to struggle for 100 years or several hundred years for a relatively advanced or a more advanced stage of socialism .  
The exhibition is vivid teaching material for party history .  It is of great , realistic significance for us to run the government and educate people in line with history , accurately understand and grasp the law governing the development of human society , and inherit and carry forward the party 's fine traditions and work styles under new historical conditions .  
I hope the masses of science and technology workers will stay on the cutting edge of the new era , closely integrating personal ambitions with the nation 's future and fate ; undertake the historical responsibility of promoting science and technology advancements and innovations ; and continuously contribute to developing China into a prosperous , democratic , and civilized modern socialist country .  
The vast working masses should be guided to more clearly understand their own historical responsibility .  Such a sense of mission should be turned into a strong driving force to play a role as the main force to continuously enhance their own quality and make contributions to the building of a rich and powerful socialist modern country with a high degree of democracy and civilization as Comrade Jiang Zemin hoped .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , the vast mass of scientific and technological workers are united and mobilized to work hard for the development of science and technology in our country and for the realization of the grand objective of socialist modernization in our country .  This is the historical mission of the China Association of Science and Technology .  
At a deeper level , due to the influence and restraints of the " Leftist " thinking over a long time , many people still could not correctly distinguished Mao Zedong 's great historical merits and his mistakes in the late years , and could not shake off the influence of the guiding theory for the " Cultural Revolution , " namely , the " theory on continuing revolution under the proletarian dictatorship . "  
To achieve their evil purpose of splitting the motherland , Taiwan splittist forces headed by Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] politically carried out , in a flagrant way , splittist activities to create " two China 's " or " one China , one Taiwan " and culturally attempted to cut off the historical and cultural ties between Taiwan and the mainland of the motherland to confuse the Taiwan society 's thinking .  
Liu Yunshan said : In various historical periods in which the CPC leads revolution , construction and reform , its propaganda and ideological work plays a very important role in disseminating the scientific truth , promoting the integration of Marxism with the practical reality in China , uniting with , mobilizing and rallying the masses , fulfilling historical tasks in various periods , advocating advanced moral practice and scientific and civilized way of life , and improving the ideological , moral , scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation .  
The fine tradition of the Chinese nation and our revolutionary tradition have been carried forward under the new historical conditions .  Patriotism , collectivism , socialist concepts and socialist moral practice have become the essential aspect of our people 's mental world .  This conforms to the moral standardization of the development of our socialist economy and the common pursuit of all members of our society .  
Marxism-Leninism and its creative development in China have fundamentally enhanced the spirit of the Chinese nation , greatly strengthened the historical initiative of the Chinese communists and the Chinese people to push forward China 's social development and make the great cause of ours to constantly forge ahead toward the lofty objectives along with the steps of the times .  
Over the past 80 years , the people of all ethnic groups , the democratic parties , and progressive figures in all circles in our country always share weal and woe and fight side by side together with our party for our nation 's independence , prosperity , and bright future .  In the historical process of revolution , construction , and reform , they demonstrate a strong patriotic spirit and an indomitable fighting spirit .  
While efforts are made in history researches , attention should also be paid to propaganda , to the collection and sorting-out of raw historical materials , and to theoretical generation and analysis so that the party history work will be raised to a new level .  Second , adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts , adhere to the analytical method of dialectical materialism and historical materialism .  Everything should be based on historical facts , and truth should be sought on the basis of facts .  
Basing ourselves on the long period of socialist construction , we have practiced new policies of reform and opening to the outside world and formulated the basic theory , line and program of our party in the initial stage of socialism after summing up both the internal and external historical experience and through hard exploration .  
The key to upholding Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in the new historical period lies in persistent use of Deng Xiaoping Theory to observe the present-day world and contemporary China , incessantly sum up practical experience and generalize it in the new theoretical light and open up new ways forward .  
Jiang Zemin stressed that the 80 years of the CPC are 80 years of constant pursuit for truth and pioneering and creation by integrating Marxism-Leninism with China 's practice ; they are 80 years of ceaseless and unremitting hard struggle for the liberation of the nation , the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people ; and they are 80 years of withstanding endless tests and growing steadily in strength in the course of accomplishing the historical missions .  
If we dogmatically cling to some individual theses and specific programs of action formulated for a special situation by authors of Marxist classics in the specific historical conditions despite the changes in historical conditions and present realities , then we will have difficulty in forging ahead smoothly and we may even make mistakes because our thinking is divorced from reality .  
do a good job of the logistic work in the preparations for military struggle and of logistic reform and innovation with high demands and the spirit of the speech as the base , by centering on the party 's objective of endeavor and historical mission in the new century , and in line with the requirements set by the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission , and realize adequate logistic support in real terms ;  
Participating comrades maintained : The important speech of General Secretary Jiang Zemin has comprehensively reviewed and summed up the glorious course of the Communist Party of China over the last 80 years , highly summarized the precious experience the party attained in its struggling course , set the objectives of endeavor and historical missions in the new century , and fully embodied and represented the fundamental interests and historical demands of the people throughout China .  
Over the 80 years under the correct leadership of the three generations of leading collectives headed by Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin , the CPC has grown from small to large and from weak to strong .  It led the Chinese people to advance wave upon wave , wage tenacious struggles , found the new China , establish the socialist system , explore ways to building socialism with Chinese characteristics , and write a magnificent chapter in the historical development of the Chinese nation .  
given a concentrated expression to the latest achievements in theoretical innovation that have been attained by the party 's leading collective of the third generation ; and is therefore an enrichment and development of the Marxist theory on political parties .  The important thinking of " three represents " has pointed out the direction for our efforts to push forward the great project of strengthening party building under the present new historical conditions and to subsequently attain constant new victories in the undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
The " Speech " has integrated theory with practice , and the ideal with reality ; and has expounded the dialectical relations between the maximum program and the minimum program of the party .  While unfolding before us the bright future of a communist society , he has also stressed that the realization of communism is a very long historical process of struggle , and has urged the whole party to devote continued efforts to a successful fulfillment of both the basic program and the historical tasks of the party at the present stage .  
They said : In his speech , Jiang Zemin made a new theoretical summary of the party 's nature , fundamental aim , guiding principle , historical mission , and progressiveness ; and clearly set forth demands in carrying through the party 's ideological line , organizational line , and work line , and in carrying forward the party 's good traditions and work style .  
Hu Angang believes that , in a situation in which the rapid deceleration of the US economy is leading to a slowdown of the global economy , it is necessary to have an overall grasp and understanding of China 's present economic situation from the angle of historical development and a relative international perspective .  
requires that the entire party membership think of danger in times of peace and keep a stronger sense of crisis , guard against arrogance and rashness , continue to work hard for implementing the party 's basic line and fulfilling the party 's historical tasks .  Jiang Zemin 's speech shows a strategic foresight , provides profound ideas , gives theoretical guidance to many issues , and is another important programmatic document of our party to carry forward its cause into the future .  
Through study and discussion , all people attending the meeting deeply realized that the important thinking on " three represents " set forth by Comrade Jiang Zemin is a creative application of the basic theory of historical materialism , which is practiced in contemporary China . It greatly enrich people 's understanding of the party 's character , basic principle , and task .  
The participants held that the important thinking of " three represents " has elaborated in a concentrated manner on the fundamental demands of maintaining the advanced nature of the CPC in the 21st century , and fundamentally answered the questions of " what kind of party we should build and how to build it " under the new historical conditions , and clearly defined the general orientation for strengthening and improving the party .  
Zhang Wannian said that General Secretary Jiang 's important speech stands at a historical , epochal , and strategic high plane , and uses a proletarian politician 's grand boldness of vision and daring combined with superior judgment - - as well as using the profound insight and enormous theoretical courage of a brilliant Marxist - - to carry out a systematic , scientific , and incisive exposition toward a series of significant questions regarding the future prospects and fate of the party and the nation .  
As the so-called " corrections " avoid the essential and concrete , steer clear of the important and dwell on the trivial , and still retain erroneous statements and absurd historical views in the original textbook , China can not accept them .  
The SEF-vs-ARATS mechanism was originally a temporary expedient designed to play the role of a " white glove " under the circumstances in those years when there was no official contact between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits , and was therefore a measure based on a specific objective historical background and serious political considerations .  
While celebrating the 80th anniversary of CPC founding and marching toward the future , we must , as is required by the three represents , ? closely center round the basic issue of what kind of party to build and how under the new historical conditions and closely grasp the two major historic subjects of enhancing the party abilities of administration and art of leadership and resisting corruption , guarding against degeneration and warding off risks , and push party building to a new stage .  
In the study of the speech , efforts should be focused on studying and understanding the party 's basic experience , the scientific connotations of the important thinking on " three represents , " the requirement for strengthening and improving party building , and party 's historical tasks and fighting targets in the new century .  
At the mass meeting celebrating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the CPC ( Communist Party of China ) , Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out profoundly that , faced with profound changes in the situation at home and abroad , if our Party is to follow the trend of world progress closely , uniting and leading the various peoples nationwide in seizing the opportunities , meeting the challenges , and successfully accomplishing the three great historical tasks , we must be unwavering in carrying out the demands of the " three represents . "  
When fathers of Marxism hold such an open and dynamic attitude towards their classical works , why do we have to be dogmatic , worship books and be restrained to some expositions and specific practical programs they proposed in specific historical conditions and concrete situations ?  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech delivered at the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China points out the Party 's historical task and objective in the new century and provides a powerful ideological weapon and enormous spiritual driving force that encourages the majority of Party members to live through all kinds of tests and forever maintain the advanced nature of Party members .  
Grasping the historical trend and keeping in step with the times , the CPC , armed with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , has done everything for the people , relied on them , kept blazing new paths for revolution , construction , and reform , continuously united the tremendous strength of the people of various nationalities who are advancing bravely , and continued to win their deep love and respect .  In the revolutionary war years , party members shed their blood and laid down their lives ;  
Japan would have difficulty achieving a genuine sentimental reconciliation with its Asian neighbors , and Japan 's international image also would constantly be damaged if it should be unable to lay down this heavy burden on its own by correctly approaching history and properly handling historical issues .  
Chen Yusu said : In May 2000 and January 2001 , General Secretary Kim Jong-il twice visited China at the important historical moments at the turn of the century , and held cordial meetings and important talks with General Secretary Jiang Zemin . This further increased the mutual understanding , trust , friendship , and cooperation between the two parties and the two countries , won warm support from the Chinese and Korean peoples , and also produced a positive impact on the international situation .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech adheres to the unity of the historical and current views , the unity of moving forward and developing Marxism and the unity of the theory and reality .  This important speech comprehensively , systematically and profoundly reveals the rich content , the scientific spirit and the mutual relationship among the " three represents " and explicitly points out the guiding and theoretical significance of the " three represents " on Party-building and the political , economic and cultural development of our country .  
In the new century , we shall be facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges .  The CPC , which shoulders the three major historical tasks , has once again set forth hopes and requirements for the younger generation .  They are required to " love the motherland , love the people , cherish lofty aspirations and broad vision , give full play to their wisdom and resourcefulness and realize their life values on the broad stage of reform , opening up , and modernization , and score deeds worthy to the times and the people . "  
To improve the party 's leadership and party building , we must first proceed from these two major transformations to earnestly study theoretical and practical issues facing party building under the new historical conditions and study the laws governing the rule of the country by the Communist Party , socialist construction , and the development of human society that underlie these issues so as to better advance party building .  
You have been fulfilling the general demand of Chairman Jiang 's " five phrases " , meeting high standards , and completely improving the quality of the troops bearing in mind the historical mission of " fighting to win " and " maintaining the true qualities , " thus outstandingly accomplishing all tasks bestowed on you by the people , forging the veteran Tibetan spirit of " being particularly able to bear hardship , to fight , to endure , to remain united , and to dedicate yourselves , " and producing large numbers of advanced role models .  
They point out that the establishment of the strategic partnership marked by equality and trust was a correct historical choice , and it has decisive significance for strengthening cooperation between the People 's Republic of China and the Russian Federation in all areas , for consolidating friendship between the Chinese and Russian peoples , and for building a just and rational international new order .  
This term , the most conscientious and advanced elements , applies to that portion of people who are proficient in scientific Marxist theory , who understand the law of social development , who define their historical mission , and who represent the basic interests of the overwhelming majority of the people .  
The historical mission for the current period put forth by our Party is , through reform and opening-up , to further liberate and develop the productive forces , promote national economic , political and cultural development in an all-around way , continuously improve people 's material and cultural standards of living , strive to build China into a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , modernized socialist country , and strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people .  
After Comrade Jiang Zemin examined the current domestic and foreign situations and the mission of our Party , and after he analyzed how to persist in keeping the Party 's nature one as the vanguard of the working class in the new historical conditions so as to safeguard our Party 's advanced nature , he put forward this extremely profound explanation , making clear the orientation of Party construction in the new period .  
This great historical process is a necessity in the social and historical development of Tibet , is a common aspiration of the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet , and is also a brilliant example as how the CPC has applied the basic principles of Marxism for the resolution of China 's national issues .  
In the first 10 years plus since the implementation of reform and opening up , the gap between the level of Tibet 's economic and cultural development with the inland and the inland as well as the coastal developed areas in the east showed a trend of further widening instead of shrinking because Tibet was restricted by natural conditions and because of historical reasons .  
Diligent and wise , Tibet 's people of all nationalities have , in the course of long historical development , made outstanding contributions in creating a splendid culture of the Chinese nation and founding our unified , multinational country .  In the past half century in particular , they have written a magnificent chapter of Tibet 's development and progress , adding a new splendor to the community of the socialist motherland .  
In the long historical development , the hardworking and intelligent people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have made remarkable contributions to creating the shinning cultures of the Chinese nation and to building our unified multinational country .  The brilliant chapter of Tibet 's development and progress in the past 50 years that you have written has added new glory to the big family of our socialist motherland .  
Whether from the historical , cultural , or geographical angles , or from the political and economic reality angle , Taiwan 's future lies with the mother mainland , and its security is determined by the close ties of people on both sides of the strait and by ultimate peaceful reunification .  
China and Malta are situated far from each other , and they are different in terms of national situation , size , population , and historical background .  However , their relations over the nearly 30 years after they established diplomatic ties can be held up as an example of equal treatment , mutual respect , and peaceful coexistence between a big country and a small nation .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out that during the " Ninth Five-Year Plan , " through comprehensive agricultural development , we improved agricultural production conditions , protected and improved the ecological environment , raised comprehensive agricultural production capabilities and efficiency , and increased agricultural citizen income .  We thus made important contributions to the historical transformation from the long-term deficiency in chief agricultural products to an overall balance and years of surplus .  In our practice we also created many effective experiences .  
In the new historical conditions , society will be diversified and the situation will become more complex .  In light of this , only with a clear theoretical understanding can one take a firm political stance , take initiatives , and hold loftier spiritual ideals .  
We have a system to establish political commissioners and political institutions .  We also have a system to base Party branches on the military units at the company level .  The availability of and the adherence to these systems enables our military to ensure the military remains under the Party 's firm control despite the dynamic historical conditions and constant changes in members of the military .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , he pointed out , persisted in being guided by Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , applied the party 's ideological line of emancipating the minds and seeking truth from facts , systematically and comprehensively enunciated the scientific content of the " three represents " principle , provided profound answers to major issues to be resolved in order to enhance and improve party building under new historical conditions , and further clarified the party 's historical tasks and objectives of striving in the new century .  
It is understood that in the view of the top Chinese leadership , the core of the " three represents " thinking ( the CPC represents the developing needs of China 's advanced social productive forces , the forward direction of advanced Chinese culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people ) lies in : Demanding the CPC continue preserving its advanced nature , winning popular support , and maintaining and consolidating its position as a ruling party under the new historical conditions .  
As commanding organs for the entire army , the four general departments put forward : We must attain a high standard in putting the " three represents " into practice and - - with a strong sense of responsibility and the sense of urgency in a race against time - - break new ground , make advances , and make innovations with keen determination to comprehensively advance the building of a more revolutionary , modern , and regularized army and struggle hard for accomplishing the historical mission entrusted to our army by the party and the people .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important " 1 July " speech comprehensively , systematically , and incisively revealed the scientific implications of the " three represents " thinking .  On the basis of comprehensively summarizing the historical experience in party building over the last 80 years , he profoundly analyzed the social , economic , and political changes which have taken place since the introduction of the reform and opening-up program .  He also briefly defined the party 's nature , aim , and missions anew , showing us clearly the way forward .  
In the new century , China and Japan should , on the basis of the spirit of " taking a warning from history and looking forward to the future " and the principle determined in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement , Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship , and Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration , continue to hold the overall bilateral relationship from strategic and historical heights , eliminate disturbances , and overcome obstacles ; and to work hard to open up a new aspect of good neighborliness , friendship , and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Japan .  
At the exhibition , more than 2,000 valuable pictures and 500 cultural relics , displayed in chronological sequence of historical development , vividly depicted the brilliant achievements scored by the people of all nationalities throughout the country in carrying out revolution , reform , construction , and reform under the leadership of the party 's three generations of central collective leadership with Comrades Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as the core .  
Recently , at an interview by a Hong Kong reporters ' delegation , Raidi , executive deputy secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and chairman of the Standing Committee of the autonomous regional people 's congress said : After the passing of the 14th Dalai Lama , we will find the reincarnated child , according to historical conventions and religious rituals that were formed hundreds of years ago .  
Raidi said : Successive Dalai Lamas first searched for a few candidates for a relevant reincarnated child , according to historical conventions and religious rituals , before selecting one of them according to the ceremony of drawing lots from a golden urn and confirming the child after the approval of the central government .  Any act that runs counter to historical conventions and religious rituals would be regarded as invalid .  
Proceeding from the profound changes in the domestic and international situation faced by our party and from major historical tasks shouldered by our party , the speech systematically and penetratingly expounded the scientific connotation and the spiritual essence of the important idea of " three represents . "  
In carrying out political structural reform , we must take into full account China 's historical background , level of economic development , and cultural and educational standards , and must also help to preserve national unity , ethnic solidarity , and social stability .  
In carrying out political structural reform , we must take into full account China 's historical background , level of economic development , and cultural and educational standards , and must also help to preserve national unity , ethnic solidarity , and social stability .  
Any historical assessment of Japan 's war of aggression has been subjected to rigorous historical examination by every successive postwar Japanese government , but their annual statements marking the " Day the War Ended " ( they dare not call it the " Day of Surrender " ) have all been disappointing .  Disregarding strong domestic and foreign opposition , Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi insisted on paying his respects at Yasukuni Shrine , where a large group of war criminals is enshrined .  
However , due to historical and practical reasons , some backward cultures , and even decadent cultures that corrode people 's mind and endanger the cause of socialism , have emerged in society .  These cultures corrupt social values , weaken the will of people , poison young people 's mind , have caused great harm to society , and have aroused the strong resentment of the masses of people .  We must make great efforts to rectify this situation .  
The important thinking on " three represents , " the party-building theory for a communist party and especially a communist party in a ruling position , and the thesis on combining the long-term struggle objective of the communist party with the contemporary historical tasks are all important theoretical subjects related to all branches of culture and social sciences .  The theoretical research work of the academy must deal with every issue and every link through in-depth study and understanding .  
Because Japanese society widely considers that neighboring countries all have requests and think that Japanese economic aid and science and technology are critical to many developing Asian nations , therefore even if people have been " offended " on the historical issue , this is of no significance and will not hinder Japan from becoming an " international country , " to the point of being a permanent member of the UN Security Council .  
The important thinking of ' three represents ' has creatively enriched and developed Marxism , reflected in a concentrated way the whole view and new historical achievements of our party in upholding and developing Marxism over the last 80 years , and fully shown that the Communist Party of China has proved itself to be a Marxist political party which is firm and sober in theory , highly mature in politics , and composed and self-confident in practice . "  
It is of typical significance , unique value , and rich historical connotation in correctly approaching the historical missions of Marxism to scientifically analyze our party 's strenuous explorations over the last 80 years and the profound scientific connotations of the important thinking of " three represents . "  
Second , the party 's basic theory , basic line , and basic program as well as numerous other principles and policies at the initial stage of socialism are extremely invaluable spiritual wealth attainted by the party after scientifically having summed up domestic and international historical experience , positive and negative .  
He said : By adopting a foreign policy of going our own way , the Bush Administration will disrupt international security , hurt our economic and environmental protection interests , and stop a historical chance for us to agree with China and Russia on limiting weapons and reducing nuclear weapons .  " These examples demonstrate that a country 's unilateral actions can not possibly form a lasting strategic framework that has the submission of all other countries . "  
General Secretary Jiang 's July 1 speech , he said , is important because it provides our party with a powerful ideological weapon for understanding , strengthening , and improving itself under new historical conditions and provides a strong spiritual force for our great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  Studying the speech is not only an important political task for the entire military now , but also a long-term strategic task .  
Today , Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Dawei said here that in the past few months of this year , with the occurrence of such events as the historical issue , Lee Teng-hui 's visit to Japan , and the Japanese prime minister 's action of paying homage at Yasukuni Shrine , Sino-Japanese relations have been bogged down in the most difficult condition over the past 30 years since the normalization of diplomatic relations .  The Japanese side should create favorable conditions for getting Sino-Japanese relations out of this predicament by resolving the current existing problems .  
as published ] " and that he himself was " a citizen of a fallen state " shortly after escaping to Taiwan . Now the Taiwan authorities ' so-called " Republic of China " is in fact nothing but a historical issue left from the civil war between the Kuomintang [ KMT ] and CPC . It is illegitimate according to either domestic or international law and it fundamentally has no right to represent China .  
Owing to the historical , geographical , natural conditions , and other reasons , it has generally formed into three regions , i.e . , eastern , central , and western regions in terms of economic development level , of which the eastern region is the highest , the western region is the lowest , and the central region is in between .  
He emphasized the necessity of giving prominence to key points , linking with the reality of the armed forces , closely centering around the two historical themes of " being able to win " and " not changing color " facing the PLA , thinking deeply about how to keep abreast of the new trends in the world 's military development and how to bring about development in big strides in the modernization of the armed forces , and putting forward suggestions and proposals that show real knowledge and deep insight .  
It is of major practical significance and far-reaching historical significance .  Through two decades of reforms and opening up , China 's comprehensive national strength has notably increased and a socialist market economic system has been preliminarily established .  Thus , conditions are ripe for accelerating the development of China 's western regions .  
Due to the historical link of nationalities , religion , cultural and geographical position and because of the resurgence of Turkism and Islamism in central and western Asia , those separatists who escaped from Xinjiang years ago are engaged in separatist activities in countries in central Asia . Xinjiang 's separatists have also used Turkey as their base of operation .  
The historical contribution of the Taiwan Strait area and the Western Pacific coastal area in the 21st century , and whether it will create wealth or engender more conflict , will be decided based on whether the leaders of Taiwan , poised at a crossroads , can accurately judge the trends of the times , distinguishing true historical opportunities from false , in order to successfully negotiate the difficult situation in which they find themselves .  
He said : The one China principle is an inevitable conclusion of China 's historical development over 5,000 years , is the objective condition shaped in the history of cross-strait relations , is the basic norm respected and observed by the international community and international laws , and is a fact commonly accepted by the 1.3 billion Chinese people ( including most Taiwan compatriots ) and tens of millions of overseas Chinese compatriots .

This is an important development of the party building theory made by the third generation of leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  It is also a practical issue that must be studied and resolved in order to uphold , strengthen , and improve party leadership under the new historical conditions .  The Shanghai municipal party committee must continue to play well the role of the core of leadership , commanding the whole situation and coordinating the efforts of all quarters .  
However , I believe that Ch'en Shui-bian 's inaugural speech addressed only minor issues and not the major one and that it avoided the important issue while dwelling on the trivial , if we judge the speech against the backdrop that Taiwan is part of the Chinese territory , that people of Chinese descent at home and abroad demanded that he make known his position on the issue of one China , and that he shoulders the historical mission of maintaining peace and stability across the strait .  
" We are of the opinion that the two sides can create a favorable condition for reaching an ultimate reasonable solution to the issue , so long as they respect historical facts and make friendly consultations based on the principle of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation . "  
Nevertheless , with a guilty conscience , he did not dare to use expressions like " two countries " but carefully chose a neutral expression such as " the two sides of the Taiwan Straits . " He said that " the same historical experiences should have laid a solid foundation for the people living on the two sides of the Taiwan Straits to gain mutual understanding and commonly seek freedom , democracy , human rights , . .  
Second , our country 's economic restructuring has entered a crucial stage , and industries are in a historical stage of large-scale readjustment .  If we do not set up and improve the social security system , it will be impossible to realize the fundamental reform of state-owned enterprises , there will be no way to readjust the industrial structure , and it will be difficult to maintain social stability .  
The separatist forces have disregarded the historical trend of China 's reunification , and pleaded with foreign forces in a vain attempt to bring about " Taiwan independence . "  This is completely a futile effort out of their wishful thinking .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin praised highly the visit of General Secretary Kim Jong-Il at the important historical moment of the turn of the century .  He maintained that the current visit is of important significance to further improvement of mutual understanding , trust , friendship , and cooperation between the two parties and two countries , and to the promotion of development of Sino-DPRK friendly relations [ zhong chao you hao guan xi ] oriented toward the new century .  
However , Annette Lu , a person who holds a master 's degree in law , has disregarded the historical facts and legal documents at the current moment when cross-strait relations are facing a severe test .  She has confounded right with wrong , and replayed in an unscrupulous manner the " old tune " of " Taiwan independence . "  
At this important historical juncture of the turn of the century , how to promote China 's scientific and technological progress and innovation , bring into play the important role of the number one productive forces of science and technology , continually provide a strong impetus for China 's economic and social development , and enable China to see even greater development in the acute international competition of the future are the significant tasks to which we must give careful consideration .  
This is the most basic requirement of dialectical materialism and historical materialism , as well as the scientific methodology of Marxism . Marx , Engels , Lenin , and Comrades Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping were all adept at putting forward new ideology and theories based on actual development changes .  
Deng Xiaoping first readjusted the past practice of using the social system and ideology as a line of demarcation and advocated proceeding from the national strategic interests in handling state-to-state relations , transcending the similarities and differences in social systems and ideology , giving no thought to historical resentment , refraining from engaging in ideological disputes , and developing relations with all countries in accordance with the norms of international relations .  
The " three represents " show that on the three questions that determine our party 's historical status and role , our party 's program , line , principles , and policies have conformed to the laws of social development and adapted to the tide of the advance of the times .  It is precisely for this reason that our party has occupied its rightful position in history , has continually promoted the onward advanced of Chinese society , and has been extensively supported and esteemed by the people of all nationalities throughout China .  
Countries differ in many ways , in their social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural heritage , economic development , standard of living , religious beliefs , and values .  Therefore , it is not possible to expect all countries to develop after a single model or system .  
The North and the South have markedly enhanced their mutual trust .  When problems occurred , Kim Chong-il and Kim T'ae-chung exercised restraint and took the initiative to express their goodwill toward each other .  Their unremitting efforts and correct decisions have eventually been crowned with the historical summit .  
The changes in the political situation in the peninsula and the process of peaceful reunification are linked with its own unique historical conditions .  This issue has also given us some enlightenment .  Personnel contacts and economic , trade exchanges can enhance understanding and mutual trust .  
Li Peng said : China similarly respects the general principle of the international community on human rights .  However , we feel that as countries have different social systems , economic conditions , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , and religious beliefs , they do not share an identical understanding of human rights .  This is very natural .  
T'ao Mu-lien , an expert in East Asia studies in the University of South California , has indicated : The fact that the " two Koreas " have held talks and have signed a historical declaration is of a major political and historic significance to pushing the Korean Peninsula towards the direction of peaceful reunification .  
He said , joining the WTO will usher in a new historical phase for China 's reform and open up .  Under the multilateral , stable , unconditional most-favored-nation principle extended by the WTO to its members , China can enter into international trade and economic cooperation and create the favorable international environment for the development of its national economic and foreign economic and trade relations and promote the country 's national economic development .  
When the " 4 June " incident took place on the mother mainland in 1989 , the statements made by the then new Taiwan leader involved the phrases with Chinese historical complex , such as the " free Republic of China " " supported its patriotic compatriots , " who should " closely unite as one " to " realize democratic reunification . "  One-China that Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo followed during their rule of Taiwan for decades can " carefully be observed " in their statements .  
Since people 's spiritual and cultural demands are restricted by historical , social , or personal factors on the one hand , and is plastic in nature on the other .  Therefore , guiding people 's spiritual and cultural life is both necessary and indispensable .  
Unremitting efforts should be made to build leading bodies of courts at all levels into a strong and powerful core of leadership that meets the " three represents " demand and that is able to shoulder the trans-century , historical , and heavy tasks so as to ensure that the judicial authority of the state is firmly grasped in the hands of the judges who are loyal to the party , the people , the Constitution , and the laws and in an effort to obviously improve the overall quality and judicial expertise of the courts .  
He emphatically pointed out : His thesis that our party should " always be a requirement in the development of advanced productive force in China - - - - a faithful representative of the fundamental interest of the greatest majority of the Chinese people " means that such a historic mission should be carried out as a dynamic historical process .  
This is a scientific appraisal made in a historical perspective and based on reality and great foresight .  It will largely encourage the business circles and all other social sectors in Hong Kong to make concerted efforts with collective wisdom , jointly support the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) government headed by Tung Chee-hwa in its administration by law , thus create a brighter future for Hong Kong .  
In the new historical period , Chairman Jiang , based on the developmental changes in the domestic and foreign situation , summarized the new experience in our army 's modernization development , creatively putting forward the scientific concept of " ideological and political development " , stressing that we must put ideological and political development in the premier position among all the army 's development projects , and he gave a series of important instructions in regard to strengthening military ideological and political development under the new situation .  
In his speech , Jiang Zemin put forward and expounded on how to understand the historical process of the development of socialism and capitalism , the impact of the practice of China 's socialist reform on people 's thinking , the influence of the contemporary international environment and international political struggle , and other major issues that have a direct bearing on the mental state of cadres and the masses .  He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
the effective protection and the active use of cultural relics and historical records ; the respect and protection that has been showed and extended to customs and folkways as well as to the freedom of religious belief ; an all-round inheritance and development of culture and arts ; a comprehensive engagement in Tibetan studies ; and by the rejuvenation of the Tibetan medicine .  All these have attested to the full that the Tibetan culture has undergone an unprecedented development , and this is a fact that allows of no doubt .  
It clarifies the historical tasks shouldered by the ideological and political work in the new century .  It profoundly expounds a series of major theoretical and practical issues , which are of fundamental and overall importance in nature .  
Under new historical conditions , the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and continuing to draw on fresh experiences , has put forward many new and important ideas and points of view , mapped out a series of interrelated moves , and creatively inherited and developed the theories of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping on party building .  
In the historical process of the new emerging out of the old , mankind 's advanced culture consciously represents the mainstream of the times , the orientation of social development , and the will of the people and is an active and dynamic spiritual force for guiding and promoting historical progress .  
This requires us to have an insight into the general international situation and a profound understanding of China 's conditions .  It requires us to put forward a correct political line and formulate feasible principles and policies based on a clearly defined historical mission .  
During her recent inspection tour of Guizhou , Wu Yi , alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and state councilor , emphasized the necessity of seriously studying a series of important instructions given by General Secretary Jiang Zemin on developing the western region , firmly seizing the historical opportunity for developing the western region , further emancipating the mind , changing concepts , boldly using foreign and domestic funds , opening up wider , and promoting development .  
She hoped all cadres and people of Guizhou will further seek unity of thinking on reform and opening up , change concepts , increase understanding , maintain a good spirit , seize the historical opportunity for developing the western region , make progress on one 's own initiative , make unremitting efforts to improve oneself , and work hard in a down-to-earth manner .  
Nevertheless , at the same time , the Taiwan authorities have refused to make appropriate efforts to respond to the two proposals put forward by the mainland of the motherland on clearly promising not to practice the " state-to-state theory " and clearly promising to adhere to the common understanding reached between ARATS and SEF in 1992 that both sides may verbally express their respective views on " adhering to the principle of one China by both sides of the strait . "  They disregarded historical facts .  
In the formulation of urban and rural development plans , we must take into account the national economic and social development plan as well as the natural environment , resources , historical and present conditions and future development of various localities in drawing a comprehensive layout .  
As a kind of comprehensive planning , urban and rural planning must properly handle the relations between the part and the whole , the near term and the long tem , needs and possibilities , economic development and social development , urban and rural construction and environmental protection , modernization and protection of historical and cultural relics , and so on .  
A city is an organic body that is constantly developing and renewing itself .  Our task is to ensure the economic and social development of cities and raise the level of their modernization while protecting their historical and cultural legacies .  
The effective protection and rational utilization of scenic and historical resources are of great importance to the improvement of the ecological environment , the development of tourism , the promotion of ethnic culture , the stimulation of patriotic passion , and the enrichment of people 's cultural life .  
As the social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , economic levels , living quality , religious beliefs , senses of value , and so on of all countries in the world differ in thousands of ways and it is impossible to ask every country to indiscriminately copy one model and one system .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech shows great foresight , has the overall situation in view , contains rich and profound ideas , possesses the distinct features of the times , and aims at very definite objectives , which is of momentous practical significance as well as far-reaching historical significance to intensifying and improving the party 's ideological and political work oriented to the new century .  We must study the gist of the speech and put it into practice in a conscientious manner .  
The party 's ideological and political work must be continually strengthened and improved in light of the continually changing reality in the new historical period , and can not be relaxed or weakened in the slightest .  
In the new historical period , departments taking part in the cooperation in science and technology for national defense have carried out reform at a deeper level , quickened development , readjusted their structure , laid a more solid foundation , improved quality , ensured supply , striven to raise their technological level and increase their ability to ensure supply , and ensured the comprehensive fulfillment of their tasks in the development of new products and in their cooperation in production .  
Third , the two countries shared common historical experiences .  China and Burma have constantly shown sympathy for and supported each other in their efforts for independence and liberation , safeguarding of national independence and sovereign and territorial integrity , and national construction .  Common national fates have closely linked the two countries together .  
Speaking of developing a tourism industry , Ismail Amat stated : Located along a vital communications line on the Silk Road , Xinjiang has peculiar and beautiful natural scenery , rich folk customs and habits , unique historical or cultural heritage , as well as infrastructure facilities , which are beginning to take shape , and thus has great potential for developing a tourism industry .  
Facts in history and international laws and norms all provide undeniable evidence to prove that Taiwan is China 's territory since ancient times .  Even though the two sides of the straits now are still in a temporary state of division due to historical reasons , this does not change the fundamental one-China fact .  This is also the written position maintained by the Taiwan authorities thus far .  
Particularly in the extraordinary 20th century , the unyielding and hard-working Asian people have written another grand epic of political awakening and economic takeoff through their unremitting efforts for prosperity .  They have thus strongly promoted the historical progress and social development .  
Recently , individuals in economic circles have pointed out that the major turnaround we are seeing in macroeconomic operations shows that the various macroeconomic regulatory measures - - primarily the aggressive fiscal policies - - implemented by China are having a significant positive effect , creating a golden historical opportunity for China 's economic development .  
In the new historical period , the Peasants ' and Workers ' Democratic Party firmly supports the line , principles , and policies adopted by the CPC since the 3d plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , conscientiously performs its functions as a political party participating in the government , and does effective work for promoting national economic and cultural development , safeguarding the political situation of stability and unity , and promoting the great cause of the motherland 's peaceful reunification .  
In the historical conditions in which the world is at a big turning point and in which tremendous changes are taking place in China , the key to fulfilling the grand , trans-century objectives set at the 15th CPC National Congress and advancing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in an all-round way lies in building a contingent of high-quality cadres who can meet the requirements of the " three represents . "  
He said , the MCPONP is an unprecedented historical meeting .  The fact that presiding officers of various national parliaments are getting together for this grand meeting is not only of an important symbolic meaning .  It also has a tremendous actual significance .  
Our party can certainly shoulder the historical heavy task of leading China 's socialist cause so long as we keenly grasp the demand for the development of China 's advanced social productive forces and the direction of China 's advanced culture and the fundamental interests and benefits of the overwhelming majority of people in China , do a good job in various work according the requirements of the " three represents , " and further improve the building of out party .  
This is extremely unwise .  The US and Chinese electoral systems can not be completely similar , because our historical traditions , economic and cultural development standards , educational level and social systems differ .  
In particular , since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee , the party central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has set forth comprehensive and profound theses on cadre supervision around the two historical themes of enhancing the party 's leading and ruling capability and enhancing the party 's ability to resist corruption and degeneration and overcome risks , and has set forth explicit guidelines , basic principles , targets , and requirements for cadre supervision work in the new period .  
and have also played an important role in promoting a democratic and scientific policymaking process .  Facts prove that to conduct investigation and study on selected major questions of economic and social development in a planned way is a good form for the democratic parties , the Federation of Industry and Commerce and non-party personages to participate in the administration and discussion of state affairs and exercise democratic supervision ; and it is also a good way to do the united front work under the historical conditions .  
In line with Chairman Jiang 's important instructions , the all-military political work meeting has put forward the historical missions of ideological and political construction in the military in the new situation - - to provide powerful spiritual motivation for winning future high-tech wars , and to provide a reliable political guarantee for maintaining the nature , inherent qualities , and style of the people 's military .  
He said : In the contemporary era , new knowledge keeps emerging in vast multitude , science and technology are advancing with each passing day , and the social productive forces are considerably elevated , which have produced enormous impacts on the world 's political , economic , cultural , and social lives , so that human beings are confronted with new , tremendous historical changes and leaps .  
General Secretary Jiang 's important speech at the central ideological and political work meeting , from a higher starting point , with a broader vision , and in a deeper sense , has brought to light the profound historical background , complicated social environment , and many other formidable challenges facing ideological and political work , and has raised our understanding of the life-line position of ideological and political work to the new height .  
At present , China 's economic structural reform has entered a crucial stage of storming fortified positions , in which the state-owned enterprise ( SOE ) reform is gradually deepened , the industrial structure is in a period of large-scale adjustment , and reform , opening up , and modernization are faced with new historical missions , for which a stable social environment is especially necessary .  
Since in history imperialism used Catholicism and Protestantism to serve its national political interests , certain foreign missionaries relied on the unequal treaties to commit all kinds of outrages and caused over 1,500 large and small missionary cases [ jiao an ] , for which many Chinese lost their lives , and a number of Chinese Catholics also became innocent victims ; these historical wounds are still there in the hearts of the Chinese people and the Chinese Catholic Church .  
This book series has condensed the changes of the Chinese nation in a century .  It has especially displayed in a concentrated manner the historical facts about the earth-shaking struggle waged by numerous revolutionary martyrs under the leadership of the CPC for national independence , the liberation of the people , and the cause of socialist construction , and has vividly recorded the lofty revolutionary spirit of the Chinese communists of heroically fighting for the interests of the motherland and the people , fearing no sacrifice .  
The Chinese Communist Party has united and led the various ethnic groups of China and carried out an indomitable and extremely hard and bitter struggle , always passing on the torch .  They overturned the " three mountains " that oppressed the Chinese people and created a new historical era in which the Chinese are their own masters in independently constructing socialism .  
Wang Zhongyu pointed out that this time , the Chinese Olympic delegation has made historical breakthroughs , displayed fully to the whole world the spiritual style and features of being united and forging ahead of the Chinese people , greatly encouraged the patriotic fervor of the people of all ethnic groups across the country , increased the national cohesive force of Chinese at home and abroad , and further enhanced the high prestige of the socialist motherland .  
Qian Qichen said : Shanxi Province boasts very rich tourist resources .  In recent years , Shanxi has entered tourism into the list of the province 's superior industries , increased the work intensity of transforming the advantages in tourist resources into the industrial advantages , initially formed a few tourist zones with special characteristics , and taken firm control of the tourist infrastructure construction , environmental protection , ecological construction , historical relics protection , and the deep-level development of tourist serial products , with a view to repeatedly optimizing and upgrading tourism .  
Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is mutually beneficial .  Japan 's yen loans to China and its official development aid have played and will continue to play an important role in China 's reforms , opening up , and modernization ; the attitude of the Japanese Government on the historical problem is generally speaking continuing to make progress , and Japan is now taking a more responsible attitude in handling the problems of chemical weapons left behind in China .  
We should take Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory as guidance , adhere to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and use the broad vision of historical materialism and dialectical materialism to observe the world , understand the overall situation , study new issues and sum up new experiences in order to continuously improve the party 's level of administration and improve its ability in controlling the overall situation of economic and social development .  
Under a new situation , we always insist on the forward direction of advanced Chinese culture and push the prosperous development of socialism 's culture and art to satisfy the growing need for peoples ' cultural spirit , and provide the insured thoughts , motives of spirit and intellectual support for economic development and improvement of the whole society , and build a nice social atmosphere and human cultural circumstance , above are honorable and difficult historical responsibilities of the cultural and art workers .  
An analysis of historical experiences and current realities of China and foreign countries throughout history will show that whether or not the nationality issue is handled well is of great importance to national unity , economic development , political stability , and social progress .  
The series has a clear-cut theme and rich contents .  It has historical depth , distinguishing features characterizing our times , and a clear objective .  It is effective teaching material for conducting political and quality professional education for cadres .  
Li Peng said that as the social system and development level of various countries are different and their historical and cultural background and concepts on value differ in a thousand ways , it is not at all surprising that they have divergent views on some problems .  The best way of solving the problems is to conduct exchanges and dialogues on the basis of friendliness , equality , mutual respect , and the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences .  
Under the new historical conditions , increasing mutual understanding and trust between the two peoples and expanding bilateral cooperation in various fields are of specially great importance to ensuring that relations between the two countries move forward in a steady and stable way and that friendship between the two peoples will continue from generation to generation .  
Wu Bangguo said : As a traditional industry , the coal industry has to shoulder a heavy historical burden .  In the current process , in which great changes have taken place in market supply and demand and the old economic system is being changed into the new , it is difficult for coal enterprises themselves to completely overcome difficulties they have encountered .  The government must make efforts to create an essential external environment and conditions in all aspects and give them specific support and assistance .  
China and Russia , two neighboring powers , share similar historical and cultural origins and have similar views on many major international issues , including the establishment of a just and reasonable international political and economic new order as well as the establishment of a multipolar world .  
He briefed the Russian guests on China 's Tenth Five-Year Plan , and stressed that China and Russia should pay attention to going with the historical trend of rapid scientific and technological development and make concrete efforts to intensify bilateral economic , scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation so as to lay a solid foundation for furthering bilateral friendly , mutually beneficial and cooperative relations . 
truthfully recorded the historical process of the motherland 's thriving development ; and provided effective media support for economic development and for comprehensive social progress .  Journalist workers often work under stress and harsh conditions .  
We must seize historical opportunities , accelerate reform and development of the journalistic cause , increase strength and vitality , win over the masses , and occupy the market .  We must make General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's " Three Represents " as a major ideological guide , earnestly promote the building of the ranks of journalist workers , so that our journalistic workers will become honest recorders of the progress of the times and become active builders of material and spiritual civilizations .  
Comrade Deng Xiaoping , chief architect of our country 's socialist reform and opening up , led all party comrades in emancipating their minds , seeking truth from facts , observing the characteristics of the times and the current international situation in an all-round way , summing up foreign and domestic socialist construction as well as historical and immediate experiences , and conducting difficult explorations , thus making important achievements in the theory and practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Zhu Rongji said : Not long ago , President Jiang Zemin made a historical visit to Cambodia and reached extensive common understanding with King Norodom Sihanouk and Your Excellency Prime Minister on strengthening the traditional good neighborly friendship between China and Cambodia . The Chinese side wishes to make joint efforts with the Cambodian side to implement the " Joint Statement " signed by the two sides to strengthen friendship and cooperation in various fields . 
The " four educations " proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin has grasped the fundamental issues which need to be urgently resolved in the ideological and political building of the army under the new historical conditions and embody a high degree of integration between political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity and between carrying forward the excellent traditions and propagating the spirit of the times .  It is also the basic engineering work and path for strengthening the ideological and political building of the army in the new era .  
The fruitful achievements of the " four educations " in the People 's Liberation Army and the armed police force have provided beneficial inspiration for strengthening and improving the ideological and political work in our Party and our military during the new historical period .  
We should do well the double-support work under the new situation , unite with and mobilize the broad masses of servicemen and people to strive for the fulfillment of our party 's historical tasks .  It is of important and profound significance to boosting our economic strength , to increasing our defense capabilities , to carrying forward our socialist ideology , ethics and culture , and to practicing our party 's fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .  
The plenary session pointed out that the current stage of the anti-corruption struggle in our country is carried out under the historical conditions of deepening reform , opening up wider to the outside world , changing the economic structure , and interwoven social contradictions .  
. facing this unprecedented ecological crisis , we must establish an intense sense of historical responsibility , premising our actions on the future development of mankind , taking as our starting point the sustainable development of our posterity and future generations , and pursuing a comprehensive approach and taking action .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " was precisely put forward from the high ground of the future and destiny of the party and state on the basis of a sober understanding and accurate grasp of the domestic and international situation , the historical tasks shouldered by the party and the reality of party building , as well as on the basis of a thorough analysis and profound summary of the positive and negative experiences of the building of proletarian political parties , especially the building of our own party .  
All party comrades , and all levels of leading cadres before all , must remain committed to the historical , practical , and developmental viewpoint of Marxism , insist that practice is the sole criterion for testing truth , display history-making initiative and revolutionary creativity , and make persistent efforts to study and tackle new problems .  
This cult organization has moved against the historical current , is completely antagonistic to the scientific world , has tarnished human civilization , and has obstructed social progress .  These have determined its inevitable fate of a rapid destruction .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : Beijing must fully take its past into consideration , base itself on the present situation and have the future in mind in its urban planning and development .  While making utmost efforts to protect local historical and cultural relics , it should strive to accelerate the transformation of the old city and strive to make the city more modernized .  
He said that since the two countries established diplomatic relations 45 years ago , the friendly cooperative relationship that has been established on the basis of mutual respect , equality , and mutual benefit has made long strides and that the Sino-Syrian relations , having withstood historical upheavals , have become a model of unity and cooperation between the developing countries .  
Li Tieying pointed out in his speech , at the historic moment of the turn of the century , standing at the plane of historical materialism , Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " has made a new and scientific summation of our party 's nature , purpose , and tasks , and embodied the innovative spirit of making efforts to open up new realms in Marxism geared to the 21st century .  
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou yesterday told Hong Kong 's elite and international figures that the people of Hong Kong are assured under " one country , two systems , " and he is pleased to see the successful implementation of " one country , two systems " in Hong Kong . However , he added that Taiwan 's historical conditions and political situation are different from those of Hong Kong , so , if " one country , two systems " is compellingly implemented in Taiwan , the people of Taiwan will feel resentful .  
Closely integrated with the new , historical conditions , the entire party must conscientiously put into practice the basic strategy of governing the country according to law and governing the country by ethics , always adhere to the principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both , " further attach importance to and step up the building of socialist ethics while continuing to step up the building of democratic legal system .  
At this historical juncture , in using its social resources and in its industrial restructuring , Hong Kong must put greater stress on cost-effectiveness and on increasing its value-adding ability .  It is wise to allow an international financier to plan financial and industrial work , because he is in a better position to : understand the needs of various industries , create new ideas , amass talents , create new industries , and achieve optimum allocation of resources .  Antony Leung will , like his predecessor , handle financial matters with circumspection .  
The meeting emphasized [ as received ] that at present the vast theoretical workers must all understand the significance of shouldering responsibility , and - - on the basis of a summation of historical experiences , as well as investigation and research on realistic conditions - - strive to promote theoretical innovations and systematic innovations .  All the vast theoretical workers should make the necessary contributions required to create new prospects for the construction of the Party in the 21st century .  
A historical document made available to the public for the first time here shows that in 1945 after victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan , a representative of the then Chinese Government officially accepted the entire land and administrative right of Taiwan from the Japanese colonialists , who were occupying Taiwan at that time , thereby once again proving that Taiwan is part of China and that the so-called " theory on Taiwan 's undecided status " is basically untenable .  
Theoretical study classes and Marxist philosophy lectures were organized at all levels to help leading cadres systematically study the theory of dialectical materialism and historical materialism and to guide grass-roots officers and servicemen and cadets in military schools and academies to master the basic viewpoints of the materialist and atheist theory of Marxism .  
He said , an important guiding idea on drawing up and instituting the 10th FYP is to take system innovation and science and technology innovation as the motive force in driving economic and social development , and this is also a scientific conclusion derived from the historical experiences of reform , opening up , and modernization in China .  
NPC Deputy Wu Xiyuan said : The system of the people 's congress , the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultations under the leadership of the CPC , and the system of regional autonomy of minority nationalities are great political achievements that our party has attained and developed during the course of leading the people to carry out a long-term struggle , are the core contents of our socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics , and are a historical choice made by all the Chinese people . 
Like the whole country , over the past five years , Jiangsu scored brilliant achievements in its economic and social development , and on the whole the province completely attained the goal of enabling its people to live a relatively comfortable life with the county as a unit and realized a historical leap from just having sufficient food and clothing to living a relatively comfortable life .  Southern Jiangsu and some areas along the Chang Jiang have started ahead of time to stride toward the third-step strategic goals .  
People are in the main approaching a historical change from having enough food and clothing to enjoying a relatively comfortable life .  The average annual economic growth reached eight percent .  Economic development has brought actual benefits to people of various nationalities in Xinjiang .  
Now , we have drawn a lesson from our painful experience .  The new round of industrial revolution in today 's world , like a tidal wave , is not only posing a grim challenge to us , but also providing us with a historical opportunity whereby we can catch up with the new revolution in science and technology and achieve leap-forward development of the productive forces .  
After entering the 21st century , the deepening of interdependence between nations has surpassed the limit of human historical experiences , and a " global community " has dimly appeared in an embryonic form .  It is time for the United States , as the designer and protector for the security and economic order of the international community , to discard the diplomatic pattern of self-centered unilateralism and to rely on the coordinating and managing functions of multilateralism .  
The tremendous cohesion and the centripetal force formed through the common historical origins and cultural traditions of the Chinese nation have been encouraging one group after another of noble-minded patriots to advance wave upon wave and dauntlessly struggle for the reunification of the motherland .  
" Hong Kong 's social , political and historical conditions are different to most , if not all .  That a degree of care and attention is required , particularly in relation to the unique situation embodied in One Country , Two Systems , and the specific intent and spirit of our constitutional imperatives , i.e . the requirements of the Basic Law . "  
Yet , you always put the basic interests of our country and Hong Kong as well as those of Hong Kong people in the first place .  You have not only accepted the historical challenge and mission courageously , but also accomplished the task entrusted to you by history with outstanding achievement .  I am pleased to note that you have played a crucial role in maintaining the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong .  
The new museum is located at the ruins of the Lei Yue Mun Fort , which was a defence work built by the British army in the 19th century .  The SAR Government has preserved and maintained the historical relics , and has rebuilt it into a museum for the benefit of the public , so that they may have a better understanding of Hong Kong 's coastal defence .  It is undoubtedly another cultural contribution to our community .  
We must point out that the preparation and construction of this museum has been no simple task .  While it is necessary to preserve the invaluable historical relics , it is also essential to make appropriate alterations and provide additional facilities to meet modern architectural standards .  Without the precious efforts of Mr Pau and his professional staff , this would not have been so successfully achieved .  On the other hand , the experts of the Provisional Urban Council have made great contributions in studying Hong Kong 's history and preserving invaluable historical relics .  
" Hong Kong is a commercial and financial centre with distinctive architectural landmarks of high professional standard , " he said .  " The Bank of China Tower , the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Building , and the Convention and Exhibition Centre are superb landmarks on the Hong Kong skyline , indicative of the vibrancy and the attractiveness of this city , " Dr Leung said , " These are balanced by buildings with historical significance , such as the Western Market and the Flagstaff House Museum of Tea Ware , "  
The key areas of collection and compilation included materials on the educational , social , economical and historical aspects of Hong Kong . As services provided by the Urban Council in Hong Kong in over a century are closely related to the Hong Kong society and the livelihood of its people , their historic value will certainly be of interest to the general public and will surely be included in our collection .  
" After the reunification , the link continues and the cultural exchange programme in heritage conservation between Hong Kong and the Mainland was largely expanded .  Our joint efforts in field studies , archaeological surveys , excavation and restoration of historical building projects resulted in the discovery of a wealth of new artefacts and information .  These have greatly improved our understanding of Hong Kong 's history and its cultural , historical and economic connection with the Motherland . "  
Mrs Yau noted that the PRO selected and preserved records and historical materials that are of enduring value to the community , to provide reference and research services to help the public to gain easy access to its valuable collections on many diverse topics and formats .  
The public , professionals and the property development sector also expressed strong support for a three-pronged approach in urban renewal , including the redevelopment of dilapidated buildings ; the rehabilitation of buildings requiring repairs ; and the preservation of buildings and areas of historical , cultural or architectural interest . 
Jointly organised by the Home Affairs Department , the Heung Yee Kuk and the South China Morning Post , the Director of Home Affairs , Mrs Shelley Lau , said : " The Most Beautified Village Contest was intended not just to encourage contesting villages to carry out certain superficial improvements to their environment .  Instead , it is aimed more at effecting long-term improvements with considerable stock attached to the village 's greening activities , maintenance and preservation of its historical relics , and the ambience of the village , apart from general environmental improvements . "  
The Thematic Exhibition Hall occupying 1,000 square metres was already opened in late 1998 .  The Standing Exhibition Hall under fitting-out will be devoted to " The Story of Hong Kong " .  With 7,000 square meters of display area , this exhibition hall will present the natural and cultural changes as well as historical development taken place in Hong Kong over the past six thousand years .  Upon completion of works , the public and visitors can look into the past of Hong Kong and know more about its magnificent natural environment and cultural heritage .  
Members considered the results of a number of simulations under the model and observed that , while they were not a perfect substitute for historical experience , simulations offered two main advantages : they allowed operations to be tested under extreme conditions ; and they provided opportunities to experiment with the design of the system .  
The panel of judges comprises five experts of local history .  They will judge based on systematic use of collected materials ( especially the primary source ) , objectivity in analysis , relevancy to the theme , concrete analysis of the study subject 's historical development and quality of production .  
There were many complicated technical and architectural problems to tackle in this project , such as geotechnical structures , electrical services installations , preservation of the historical remains and natural environments as well as special environmental conditions required for the preservation and display of artefacts that have to be taken into consideration .  
In conclusion , he stressed that regulatory measures in overseas jurisdictions were varied because of their different historical backgrounds and social needs .  Overseas legislation would not be wholly applicable for Hong Kong and information collected in the research exercise was thus for reference of interested parties only .  
The Chief Curator of the Museum Dr Joseph Ting Sun-pao noted that the exhibition was the soul of the Museum and also a showcase of the dedicated hard work done by the Museum staff in the past 26 years in collecting , preserving and researching the history and development of Hong Kong . He also noted that with a rich mixture of ecological settings , panoramic screens , dioramas , interactive programmes and artefacts , the exhibition outlined the natural environment , cultural heritage and historical development of Hong Kong in a life-like manner .  
" It is no longer true that all Hong Kong people are too wrapped up in making money to pay heed and appreciate their heritage .  Perhaps a majority of them still does but a significant minority is demanding spiritual sustenance from Hong Kong 's rich heritage , be it archeological relics , historical buildings , traditional and cultural practices and all manners of antiquities .  
As an interim measure and pending the finalisation of a long term resources allocation model by HA , hospital expenditure may be allowed to exceed the historical budget allocation if the Chief Executive of HA ( CE / HA ) is satisfied that the hospital management has taken appropriate measures to control its expenditure and that the budget deficit is justified on the grounds of real service needs , and taking into consideration the total requirements within the cluster which the hospital belongs .  
It involves selecting a list of the major historical storms which had induced severe landslips or flooding , computing the rainfall amounts brought by these storms to areas of different sizes , and maximizing these rainfall amounts to those that would be obtained if the water vapour content in the storms attained the climatological maximum .  
Focusing on cultural , historical and social changes of Hong Kong and blending oriental and western cultural experiences from ancient times to the contemporary world , the Company aims to create multi-faceted artistic works .  With distinctive stage languages , styles and directions , the Company hopes to reflect the " fanatic " situation of Hong Kong in the new millennium through their productions .  
At the legislative level , sites and structures with outstanding historical and architectural / archaeological values are declared as monuments , and stringent statutory restrictions imposed to prohibit demolition and limit alteration .  
To give people a clearer impression of the technological achievements of ancient China , the National Science Hall has spent 2.5 years in preparing an exhibition , which opened March 15 , based on Chinese scientific achievements . The exhibition includes original objects , and specimens together with models and charts prepared from historical documents .  
Situated at the confluence of three rivers in the southwest corner of Taipei County , Sanhsia is an area rich in both history and natural scenery . Once a flourishing agricultural trade center and forty years ago a booming coal-mining town , Sanhsia has over the years been supported by the local tea industry and the commerce which the rivers bring . Today , one of the few places where Ching dynasty architecture and a traditional tea market ' can still be seen , Sanhsia offers much of historical significance to the visitor .  
New construction of buildings and roads is a continual danger to the city 's treasured historical architecture . Tainan County is wide and level , with an area of approximately 68 miles . With the sea on one side and fertile plains on the other , Tainan has long been favored as both a fishing and agricultural center . Its fishery fleet brings in more than 30,000 tons of fish per year .  
The materials can be divided into several major categories : chia-ku wen remains ( oracular bone inscriptions ) , ancient artifacts , original editions , government documents from the Ming and Ching dynasties , local records , and modern historical documents .  
But the historical drama played out on this beautiful stage during the following century , in which the chief actors were the Chinese , the Dutch , the Spanish , and the Japanese , has nearly vanished into the mists of antiquity . Not only is the story little known among the general public , but the field is practically unexplored among academic researchers as well .  
The main reason that scholars on Taiwan have been lax in studying the island 's seventeenth century history , Dr . Nakamura feels , is the shortage of historical materials available to them . During the seventeenth century the aborigines still lived by hunting and fishing , and the Han Chinese immigrants were mostly poor farmers and fishermen who left no written records behind , while the historical documents of the Cheng clan ( descendants of the Ming loyalist Koxinga ) were destroyed during the Ching dynasty .  
From transient visitors who left their hometowns for a temporary stay there , they have made themselves into the sector of the populace with the most economic clout on the island , but owing to special historical and geographical factors , they have been unable to shake off the psychology of transience .  
Thinking about all this from the angle of historical geography , I think northerners are used to being ruled by nomadic tribes , and the physical environment makes northerners more open-minded ; southerners , on the other hand , are the stubborn guardians of Chinese cultural traditions , so to speak , they opened up the south when they fled there to escape foreign domination , so they have a strong " spirit of resistance . " Q : Of what benefit were your two years of fieldwork ?  
Highly experienced editor Liao Chingsung , who has worked with all the new directing talent , remarks : " Society was just entering a better off phase , and with basic living requirements taken care of the audiences wanted to have more information . " The new directors were on the scene to present social and historical aspects hitherto ignored or considered taboo , at the same time as providing something for the new urban middle classes to spend their money on and talk about .  
" These 18 ob jects serve as a pretty good representation of Ming art from both inside the imperial court and out , " says National Palace Museum Vice Director Chang Lin-sheng . The Emperor Hsiao-tzung of the Ming Dynasty , for instance , with its subject 's kindly , refined expression and its harmoniously matching background , is a work of great historical value and a masterpiece of the imperial academy .  
For example , Tang dynasty IOUs , contracts and accounts of interest rates provided economic historians with important evidence . All kinds of censuses , land records and documents of civic associations brought to light the pattern of land transfers and civil activities . Yet the mass of Buddhist sutras and ancient literature was even more important for instilling new life into literary , historical and philosophical research . Tunhuang studies had begun .  
It was just unfortunate that the manuscripts came to light at the height of the wave of enthusiasm among Western scholars for archaeological research in Central Asia at the end of the nineteenth century . With the chaotic Ching court possessing neither the means nor motivation to preserve the historical relics , close to half were bought - - or misappropriated - - by foreigners and scattered throughout the West .  
The formal features of overseas Chinese buildings in Malaysia come from southern Fukien , reflecting the deep historical ties that the local immigrants have with China proper .  
A . With any kind of historical research , especially recent or contemporary , for which many of the people involved are still alive , it is comparatively easy to be coolly objective . Yet it is also , therefore , difficult to get a true picture and description .  
Today Taiwan has become famous around the globe as one of the Four Little Dragons of Asia , while the mainland has shocked the world with the bloody suppression at Tienanmen . China has entered an unprecedented historical period . In a rapidly changing international situation , with close economic and trade ties across the Taiwan Strait , we in Taiwan must squarely face the chaos and disorder appearing in society during a transitional period of democratic constitutional reform .  
Wu is the executive director of the foundation and its painful opening announcement was like a short summary of his work : " The Chinese Communists established the reform-through-labor brigades some 40 years ago . Their inmates still include so-called counter-revolutionaries , class enemies , those deemed to be against the party and socialism , religious figures , " historical " counter-revolutionaries and members of the Tienanmen democracy movement .  
Since the 1960s women in Taiwan have been entering the labor market in droves , making a major contribution to the island 's economic miracle . There are equal educational opportunities , greater opportunities in the work place , and an ever more diverse society . . . . These have allowed Taiwanese women to break through the historical Chinese mold for women as weak , dependent and subservient , revealing active , independent and self-motivated women striving for personal achievement .  
In films depicting ancient events like Mulan Enlists , they employed the incidents and the words of historical figures to either encourage patriotic sentiment in their viewers or to vilify the traitors who had shamelessly sold out their country . Although this infuriated the Japanese and their Chinese collaborators ; there was nothing specific that they could cite as a violation . This made them intolerable . "  
For apart from the historical space-time and special political and social circumstances constituted by the discourse , the " special context " which he has chosen is on the one hand inherent in the very phylogeny of the sub-genres within modern fiction , and on the other hand is a basic turning point in the development of Chinese and Western culture , highlighted by all the theories of contemporary culture and literature .  
Faced with a historical and culturat situation of apparent " change and decay in all around , " his section title From Fin-de-si ? cle to Fin-de-si ? cle , and the Four Predictions which he goes so far as to put forward , are actually a sign of his deep sense of sympathy for the time and concern for his faraway country , although this is not necessarily expressed in gloomy , sorrowful language .  
Disturbing the grave site is equally as regrettable as the loss of the objects inside the graves . When relics are discovered without relation to the excavation area and its surrounding environment , their archaeological and historical value is damaged . "  
God 's Dice collects eight of Kuo Cheng 's recent stories together . Material ranges from the middle-class escapist rhapsody of " God 's Dice , " the hell bent for leather adolescent days of " Flying Sword , " and the sordid circus antics of the political arena in " Put on a White Face , " to the driven historical mission of " The Last Proclamation " and the deranged baby killing of " How to Execute an Infant . "  
However , Chou Yu-kou says she had no wish to take on the solemn mission of the " biographer of a historical figure , " but rather that as a news reporter she simply wished to make discussion of political topics more free and information more open . Also , by writing in a style " closer to real life and to ordinary people , " she hoped to give the general public a closer understanding of politicians ' joys and sorrows and the way they think .  
But the old trails run deep into the furthest recesses of the mountain ranges , and were often cut along hunting trails and the tracks worn by wild animals , so that they are difficult for most people to reach , and with little in the way of historical records , searching them out is an extremely difficult task .  
With their saddled roofs and swallowtail ridge ends , the delicate carving on the wood and stone of their facades , and their lively chiaochihtao ( decorative ceramic panels showing scenes from historical stories in relief ) , they are a fine example of the Southern Fukienese building style .  
The essence is entirely in the trailThese small foot paths and trails have gone from being the indigenous people 's " settlement trails " in earliest times , to being " military affairs roads " or " barbarian management roads , " to being the " fitness trails , " " historical sites " and " scenic routes " of today 's national park . Their roles have often changed , but their importance is the same as of old .  
We saw old women who were living proof of the traditional model , mature women caught at the crossroads of tradition and contemporary society , and women who have crossed the historical divide and are actively creating their own space for the " new generation . "  
Over the last 80 years , the entire internal and external layout of this Japanese-occupation building has remained unchanged . Seeing the sunlight streaming in from the courtyard , casting the pattern of the long rows of windows into its quiet and lonely red-carpeted corridors , one feels a trance-like sense of historical space and time welling up irresistibly inside one .  
Q : Your book puts forward quite a few interesting observations . One of these was that certain illnesses are exclusive to Taiwan , such as " ghost phobia " and " taboo phobia . " Also , you observed that China 's historical phenomenon of communal speech-making seems similar to the modern group therapy sessions currently popular in the West .  
Hong Kong textbooks , which tend to adopt a pragmatic approach , do their utmost to avoid ideology . When describing historical incidents they mainly confine themselves to facts , and when talking about factors leading to conflicts they also do their best to avoid either laudatory or derogatory language , and try to bring out both positive and negative aspects .  
Increasingly frequent interaction between mainland China and Taiwan , their respective political climates , and the new world order taking shape in the post-Cold-War era are of course important historical backdrops , but the ominous tone of the book 's title , and related historical events which the author used as examples , were factors leading to the sensation surrounding T-Day Many people who had never even read the book joined in the debate , some were even frightened to the point of making preparations to emigrate .  
Among the historical materials in the National Palace Museum relating to Liu Mingchuan , one historical incident is particularly worthy of note : In 1884 the French , after failing in an attack of Keelung , attacked Fuzhou . The naval battle there , which took place in the afternoon of the third day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar , lasted only half an hour ( some say only seven minutes ) before the Qing 's southern fleet was defeated .  
When the Chinese wallpaper that was admired for its fresh colors and lively flowers and birds came under the dark aesthetic of the Gothic search for historical roots , it was described as having " harsh colors " and being " too lavish in imitating nature . "  
For instance , in recording oral history about the February 28 incident , people previously put the stress on external facts , such as witnesses who saw people being tortured , etc . Now the focus has turned to the suffering imposed by the entire process and how the experience affected people inside . This is a change in historical perspective .  
The report that was published at the time clearly stated the entire range of the site , and furthermore requested relevant units to " quickly plan preservation of certain areas and designate them protected historical landmarks . "  
Furthermore , too many units are in charge of historical landmarks and cultural artifacts , so that no one knows whom to follow . For example , historical landmarks are administered by the Ministry of the Interior , but antique objects inside protected historical buildings are administered by the Ministry of Education . The central , provincial , county and municipal governments all have " cultural personnel " with the same general function . The resulting mish-mash of authority and responsibility means that in the end the affair falls into the pattern of no one managing at all .  
Taking the February 28 incident for example , historical data on the incident has been reconstructed bit by bit from oral testimony . Because of inadequacies in the relevant documentary materials , it is only through set after set of interviews that basic evidence has been acquired . Thus we can learn , for example , what happened in each locality , and find out about the lives of those killed or injured .  
Should other historical reconstructions , for example those about Taiwanese soldiers or the February 28 incident , be seen in a similar light ? Another easily overlooked pitfall of oral history is that the viewpoint of the interviewer or editor will be imposed on the interviewee , or cultural or humanistic viewpoints will be superimposed and unwittingly enter the thinking of the respondent . These external ideas and interpretations may shape the memories of the interviewee , so that he or she ends up spouting someone else 's point of view without even realizing it .  
" Having been stripped of rank , status and family , all these men had left was direct and honest communication with others , " Yu writes of those banished to the northeast . ( page 48 ) Relying on a rich historical imagination , Yu finds the spirit of exile in scant lines of poetry the exiled have left behind and shows the traditional noble spirit of the Chinese literati in their efforts to help others in times of trouble .  
Wei recalls that he started reading the magazine in his freshman year at college , before people were free to speak as they pleased , yet the magazine was very bold about what it published . The historical documents were more stimulating and comprehensive than his formal history education at university .  
Deputy Director of the Academia Historica Chu Chung-sheng believes that Liu Shao-tang 's collection and organization of historical materials has definitely made a " comprehensive " contribution to Chinese history , especially that of the period of entrenched hostility between the ROC and the PRC after the civil war . Many major figures in modern history did not make it to Taiwan , and from this point the accounts about them become like a kite whose string has been snapped . Fortunately , some material on these historical personages has been recorded in Biographical Literature .  
While warfare provided partial impetus for the invention of ingenious new weaponry , " the emergence of the wooden ox was no historical accident , " asserts Wang Jian , conveying his enthusiasm for the history of Chinese mechanical science . " It was just one among a series of technological inventions . " During the Spring and Autumn period the brilliant craftsman Lu Ban created an unusual carriage for his mother , driven by a wooden figure .  
It is an historical asset that is part of the collective memories of the people who live in Taiwan , and also provides living instruction about the history of railroads here , and could also be a concrete way for the government to show their concern for Taiwan 's native culture . " It has more meaning from the perspective of cultural preservation and education . "  
While they wait for the museum , much of the historical heritage has been disappearing , particularly over the last decade . Many branch lines have closed , and a number of wooden stations which had great character have been torn down and replaced . Many precious carriages , after being withdrawn from service , have not found a happy retirement home , but have been sold off for scrap at a price of NT $ 5 per kilogram . " In some cases they did n't even keep one ! "  
In October last year it was reported that Taichung Station was to be moved underground , and that the old station building , which dates from the Japanese occupation era , might be demolished . The RCS joined with several other cultural and historical associations to put on a campaign to plead for the life of the 80-year-old station , including an event in which groups rode trains from both north and south to meet in Taichung . Finally they managed to get the station building designated a Grade 2 national monument by the Ministry of the Interior .  
Meanwhile , the main regulations governing Taiwan 's relations with Hong Kong have been largely completed . July 1997 will not merely be a starting point for Tung and the people of Hong Kong . Taiwanese , mainland Chinese , overseas Chinese , and Asia-watchers everywhere are waiting with bated breath . Tung is indeed bearing an unprecedented historical burden .  
As always on other inspection tours of historical sites over many decades , Professor Lin Heng-tao wore his " patented " uniform : a plastic Tianlan washing powder bag and a pair of big , battered old leather shoes . But what was different was that when this old gentleman-now after all in his eighties-appeared on the scene with bent back , clutching a walking stick and with a nurse tagging along behind , some people were deeply shocked .  
Taiwan in those days was wilderness , but the wide-open land and bountiful resources continued to attract Han Chinese from the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong . According to historical sources , the population of coastal Fujian and Guangdong in that era was highly concentrated , with mountainous areas outweighing habitable ones , which further intensified the attraction of Taiwan for the Han .  
The Academia Sinica is quite confident in stating that researchers of early and medieval imperial Chinese history , for instance , can regard the on-line Twenty-Five Books of History as primary sources . For researchers of late imperial China from the Song dynasty on , because there are abundant historical materials , the materials of this archive are not the only ones available , but they certainly should not be overlooked .  
In September 1994 the Cultural Committee of the Preparatory Committee began to formally discuss such matters as the names and emblems of government departments and agencies , arrangements for public holidays , the design and issue of postage stamps , the content of school textbooks , recognition of academic qualifications and so on , and also affirmed the principle of removing the visible trappings of colonial rule . Since then , wave after wave of actions to remove historical symbols has swept through both the public and private sectors .  
Leaving aside the earliest relations between man and elephant , it was beginning in the 16th and 17th centuries , when Europeans first penetrated the continent , that the African elephant began to face mass slaughter . After three centuries of killing , the elephant population was devastated . In Capetown , South Africa , for example , when the government established the national park in 1931 , there were only 11 elephants , compared to the historical peak when at least 100,000 elephants roamed the grassy plain .  
" To be honest , from a greater historical perspective , it would be pushing it to call Wistaria House a ' real ' historic landmark , " says Huang Fu-san , director of the Academica Sinica 's Institute of Taiwan History . However , the Taipei city government decided to list Wistaria House as a landmark . The committee is trying to set a new example whereby historic landmarks are judged not only by external criteria , but by their individual " personality " and history as well .  
Architecture scholar Wang Chen-hwa says that there are three kinds of historic building restoration : The first is untouched preservation , leaving a building how it is without touching a thing . Secondly , when a building has urban historical significance , there is restored preservation . Thirdly , if the building is still connected to people 's lives and is usable , a preservation method that involves active utilization of the building can be adopted . " Historic buildings are living and changing all the time , " he says .  
" There does not need to be a conflict between the needs of urban development and historical building preservation , " says Tseng Shu-cheng , an assistant professor in Tamkang University 's Architecture Department . Preserving historic buildings or spaces is not intended to stop time and halt development . On the contrary it is intended to use their historical essence to make a new and creative use of the space .  
Given that , based on historical experience , forces in an amphibious assault are only about one-third as effective as on land ( i.e . effective fighting capability declines by two-thirds ) , unless the PRC develops transport and supply ships capable of carrying and supporting large numbers of troops , it would be very difficult to invade Taiwan .  
" I hope in the future we can trek once per year , passing through traditional lands and places of historical importance , to understand how the West Rukai spread . We will also survey the natural resources . " Sasala says that elders told him many things he did not know-about things that happened long ago , and that place names were often derived from commonly used plants . Creating a foundation of shared knowledge among the generations marks the beginning of transmission of the tribal culture .  
Huang Chien-yi also reveals that in a future textbook edition which is still at the experimental stage , historical and mythical exemplary personages have almost disappeared , and the few remaining representative persons are all taken from daily life . The old style of teaching loyalty and filial piety by expecting children to model themselves on saints and sages is to disappear .  
By the same reasoning , qi which condenses with sufficient harmony may be unchanging and maintain its form eternally . Humans live between heaven and earth , and can participate in the processes by which heaven and earth are nourished and life created and changed . The Yi Jing ( Book of Changes ) lays great stress on the continuous burgeoning of life within the vast universe . Thus we can see that there is a historical background to the continuous emergence of ideas concerning elixirs of immortality and fairylands peopled by immortals .  
Lu Dongbin was a Tang-dynasty historical figure who trained himself in the Daoist arts in hopes of becoming an immortal . He has long since passed into popular lore as an immortal with a strong preference for the company of women . He is well-known for his flirtations with a famous courtesan , and for his frequent drunken revelry at the Yueyang Pavilion .  
Liu Tseng-kui , a research associate at the Academia Sinica 's Institute of History and Philology , created History Links ' basic structure out of his personal collection of website bookmarks , accumulated over years of combing overseas websites for historical data for his research . In the course of his research , Liu discovered that while there was no dearth of literary and historical websites in Taiwan , there were few online collections of links to such sites . He therefore assembled his own site last year , dividing his vast collection of bookmarks into categories .  
Professor Rolf Trauzettel of the University of Bonn also observes that the ideas of Confucianists of different historical periods were not entirely the same , and that these ideas were often encumbered with political aims and made into instruments of rule by those in power . Early Confucianist thinking was basically constructed on the level of morality and personal integrity , so it is unlikely to have had either a positive or a negative influence on China 's modernization and economic development .  
" The fact that aboriginal cultures are ' living cultures ' allows the Sheng Ye Museum to adopt an unusual style of exhibition , " explains Hsu Kung-ming , associate research fellow at the National Museum of Natural Science . " Unlike many other museums which must rely on displays of historical artifacts , the Sheng Ye Museum pays equal attention to collecting reproductions of antique styles , modern works of aboriginal art , and exhibiting displays created by contemporary craftsmen .  
Amidst the excitement and fury of a new tide of literary activity , 26-year-old Wang Anyi published The Falling Rain , a romantic short story about Wenwen walking through the rain in hopes of running across a boy she had once happened to meet . According to Sung Ju-shan , " Under the communist regime , with its stress on historical materialism , no one had ever before published a story that focused on the emotions of an adolescent girl .  
Chung 's favorite subject is an ancient gate built in Neipu 's Fungtien Village in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing dynasty ( ca . 1901 ) and recently declared a historical building . But in his paintings the gate differs somewhat from the way it looks today . " I paint it in the colors it had when I was a child . The houses have been repainted several times since then and have lost their original feeling , " says Chung , who grew up in Neipu .  
Viewing this demographic shift within its proper historical context , however , sheds a different light on the issue . Water resources were seldom located in the plains ; rather , they were most accessible along the middle reaches of rivers . This was a key reason why Taiwan 's early Hakkas chose to live in the hills .  
" Hsinchu residents seem conservative and parochial on the surface , " says Chen Mei-chun , a researcher with Dandelion Workshop , " but once you have made contact you find that they can be very flexible , and highly spontaneous . " When Chen was studying at Tsinghua University she spent some time filming a documentary and collecting historical material in the Chincheng New Village , a military dependants settlement just across from the university .  
A half-century ago , our image of the Han period still rested entirely upon what we could learn from historical records , but all that changed beginning in 1972 thanks to a series of major archeological finds at a number of tombs dating back to the Han dynasty . A huge quantity of silks , wooden tomb figurines , bamboo slips used for writing , and other burial items cast an entirely new light upon the way Chinese people lived two millennia ago .  
Over 70% of Tungshih 's population is of Hakka ancestry , and both civic organizations and ordinary people have preserved large numbers of Hakka artifacts and much historical material . After the earthquake , the Taichung County Hakka Cultural Association realized that these valuable cultural and historical assets might be destroyed by the bulldozers as damaged houses were demolished . They urged the Tungshih Township authorities to slow down the demolition work , to give them a few days ' time to save what they could .  
From the time of Emperor Wu Di onwards , in the middle period of the Western Han dynasty , the government and people really began to focus on developing education . The rank of " Doctor of the Five Classics " was created , a purely academic post that involved historical and political research but had no specific political functions . As time went on , however , incumbents of the post began to be drawn into administrative matters and take on a political role .  
The DPP does not carry the historical burden of this conflict , and has already relaxed its ideological limitations . I was born and raised in Taiwan , and all my family and assets are here in Taiwan . My fate is linked to the fate of the vast majority of Taiwan 's people . I think this is the basic reason why the DPP is better positioned to deal with cross-strait relations than the KMT .  
Liu Shao-tang , who in the course of his life rescued or brought to light countless quantities of Republican-era historical materials , and was variously described as " single-handedly the equal of a nation " and " head of the ' unofficial Academia Historica , ' " never sought fame or fortune , and was always affable , cordial and sincere .  
As Liu Shao-tang explained in Volume 64 , No . 2 : " From the struggle between Sun and Huang in the early years of the Republic , through the chaos of the warlord era and the North-South standoff , to the periods of cooperation and conflict between the Nationalists and the Communists , Yu witnessed countless political struggles . He saw how much historical data was distorted or destroyed , how right was turned into wrong and black into white , and how whoever won the battles also won history .  
The situation in the US made me aware of the gap between rich and poor , and I came to realize that race has a lot to do with it . The tension between whites and blacks in America is very obvious , and my academic training gave me a way to analyze the situation and place it in its proper historical context . I learned that gender is n't the only dividing line in society ; there are also class and racial divisions .  
On the subject of cross-strait relations , Chen stressed that the people of Taiwan and mainland China share a common ancestral , cultural , and historical background , and he stated his belief that the leaders on both sides have the wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future " one China . "  
Anything to lift us above the humdrum reality of daily life . It 's the same old story : events get embellished with every telling until they enter the realm of myth . For example , look how folklore has handled the characters of Zhuge Liang and Guan Gong . The historical record shows that the real Guan Gong did n't even have moustache , let alone the bushy beard that he 's now credited with in the popular imagination .  
Moreover , Kurth draws parallels between the main character in Notes and Taiwan 's current situation in the world : " That Taiwan is under permanent siege , threatened by a larger mass , mainland China , is an obvious but essential metaphor in Chu 's novel of gay men facing the truth about their mortality . Living on borrowed time and borrowed culture , caught between the ersatz pleasures of the West and the call of historical destiny . . . . "  
Lan Po-chou believes that Taiwanese historiography needs to be developed concurrently on an official level , through the full opening of archives , and on an individual one , through oral history . Only by rigorously pursuing both these lines of historical inquiry in tandem can the true history of Taiwan be recovered .  
The " one priority " was arts education . The " two legs to walk on " was a reference to the importance of state-run professional opera troupes and the encouragement of private theater troupes . And the talk about " three items of equal importance " meant that traditional opera , contemporary opera , and newly composed works dealing with historical subjects were all equally deserving of attention .  
When the KMT was voted out of the presidency last year after a half century in power , many worried that the Republic of China had come to an end , but our national identity is only clearer now that the Taiwan-oriented DPP has come to power . The ROC comprises the territory of Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen , and Matsu . Only a ruling party free of historical baggage can take the bold surgical steps needed to rid the country of long-festering tumors .  
But the name has historical significance . When the earliest Han Chinese settlers moved into the local area ( today part of Shihkang Rural Township ) , there was frequent conflict between the Chinese and the Aborigines . To minimize disputes , a Chinese official ordered a large moat dug just downstream from where Tuniu Elementary is located today . Next to the moat the Chinese piled up 19 large defensive earthen mounds .  
Chen Yuh-jean says there is no need for frustration . World Heritage guidelines place special importance on the agreement and cooperation of local residents . " So long as people are enlightened about the real value of the old Mountain Line , " he says , speaking of one of the sites less likely to make the final cut , " and preserve its historical and cultural value and develop only economic activities that are compatible with those values , then ten years from now it may find itself at the top of the list . "  
But the reason why the Chin-kuashih-Chiufen area can be considered a world heritage asset , argues Monica C . Kuo , president of the Chinese Institute of Landscape Architects in Taiwan , is that its historic impact extended far and wide . From a historical perspective , the gold produced in Chinkuashih and Chiufen profoundly influenced the economic and colonial history of Asia in the first half of the last century .  
Academia Sinica professor Chen Kuo-tung , who served as chief editor of Leaves in the Wind , is quick to concede that the historical materials in the book have to be taken with a grain of salt , but argues that it makes a valuable contribution by bringing together scattered impressions of Taiwan that Westerners have had over a span of more than three centuries , thus giving local readers a chance to understand what their homeland has looked like to foreigners .  
" Although salaries were very low , the work had a clear objective and someone was looking out for us in our lives . It was like growing up in a warm family , and none of the men who worked together in Lintienshan will ever forget it , " says Chuang Ming-yi , a true second-generation Lintienshaner who was born here , grew up here , currently works in the forestry work station , and is also in charge of the Lintienshan cultural and historical workshop .  
Not long after the founding of the cultural and historical workshop , Chuang Ming-yi 's own mother fell ill with cancer . During the two years of running back and forth between the mountain town and hospitals , Chuang developed a deep understanding of life and death .  
She has done nearly 30 serials , totaling more than 1000 hours . While she has worked in numerous genres , including wuxia ( stories of Chinese chivalric martial arts masters ) , historical , period , and romantic , she is especially well-known for wuxia dramas . Virtually every one of her wuxia serials has won or been nominated for several Golden Bell Awards , setting the standard for this format .  
Ever since Hero premiered in the mainland , the debate surrounding the film has become all the more intense . Many mainlanders were more than a bit dissatisfied with director Zhang Yimou 's presentation of history , specifically questioning the historical veracity of his portrayal of the infamous first Qin emperor ( Qinshihuang ) as an enlightened ruler who saved both China and its people . Hong Kong audiences had their own gripes with the film .  
In imposing its rule over Taiwan , Japan deliberately gave concrete forms to its imperial authority , as we can see from many historical documents . For example , there were precise rules governing the number of buttons , the weapons , and the shoes of ordinary policemen . With the adoption of such detailed forms , throughout society a new body language took shape that expressed degrees of authority . You can still see this in the body language of older people .  
Yao observes that given its special historical background Taiwan has shown an innate ability to integrate elements of Eastern and Western cultures and believes that how this quality is utilized will determine whether Taiwan is able to create a new culture . However , if people blindly restrict themselves or fall into the trap of " material determinism " wherein form transcends essence , or excessively highlight regionalism , either one can just as easily lead towards the dead end of " exclusive localism . "  
Many years ago , Nanfang Shuo became interested in the origins of language . Taking vocabulary often seen in the reporting of news events as his starting point , he set about tracing the historical origins of certain words and phrases whilst also discussing the process by which their meaning in society has evolved . For example , researching the Chinese expression for " mafia " ( heidao , literally " black way " ) Nanfang Shuo conducted a textual search of references to black and the metaphorical implications of the color to Chinese people .  
The Cultural Bureau of Taichung County last year organized the teachers ' pilgrimage group so as to disseminate understanding of the religious meaning of the pilgrimage and its transforming spiritual power . This year it added groups of volunteers who explained the cultural and historical significance of the festival and recounted their personal experiences with the majesty and power of the tradition .  
It occupies an area of nearly 12,000 square meters , and cost NT $ 380 million to build . The idea for its design came from the historical vicissitudes of the archeological discoveries , and from the first peoples who crossed the sea in boats to come to Taiwan . The museum is built in three disparate architectural styles , representing the connection between mountains and sea , between past and present . The arched steel-framed structure symbolizes the sea , with the structural layout employing outward radiating lines to indicate the ocean .  
Unlike most temples , which have employed tile and concrete for a speedy reconstruction , the Paoan Temple used good materials and hired skilled artisans . A grade-two historical site , the temple was restored in a slow and careful manner .  
Yet , while his improvements on traditional designs were meeting with great approval , they were n't satisfying his creative desires . From an early age he had been a great lover of painting and very familiar with historical folktales , so he decided to leave the ranks of craftsmen , breaking free from the shackles of tradition , and to adopt innovative styles using Western realism to create new works that more richly displayed a purely artistic creativity .  
Because of my personal interest in collecting , I 've spent over 20 years doing field research . I 've come in contact with a lot of extremely valuable first-hand materials and seen many aspects of our past that do n't get mentioned in formal historiography . As a result , I 've come to feel strongly that history does n't really come alive unless you approach it from a lot of different angles and look at historical development as something pushed forward by an entire people .  
For 40 years the authorities labeled this tragic historical event as an uprising against legitimate authority . It was only in 1987 , after the lifting of martial law , with the formation of the " 228 Peace Promotion Association , " that efforts got underway to reverse unjust verdicts , rediscover the historical truth , and achieve reconciliation in society .  
When combined with the growing leisure farming industry , this restoration takes on even more importance . All along the 9.6-kilometer Niutou-Sanhsing section of the Taipingshan railroad , a variety of beautiful natural vistas greet the eye-soaring mountains , creeks and valleys , fields , villages , and small towns . All this has great tourism potential , and aside from spurring the growth of peripheral industries such as accommodation and food service , it also has a great historical importance .  
Thinking back on his childhood , Yeh says that his father often used the free time outside the busy farming season to recite Chinese historical serial novels to his neighbors . Yeh was deeply influenced by his father and loved reading . Under the supervision of NTNU professor Tang Tsu-chung , he read a lot of biographical literature . For this reason Yeh learned that modern Chinese history is made up of heroic figures whose successful deeds were all made possible by " idealism , hope , and determination . "  
A related inscription can still be found near the Fuyu Temple located in the old part of Tanshui . In order to familiarize people with Taiwan and the Customs Museum , whenever Yeh travels or undertakes on-site study in Taiwan or abroad , he distributes the promotional brochures he carries around , hoping that people will visit alternative historical sites and museums , which are often not on the beaten track . Then they will realize the truth of the saying that " when historic figures have faded away , the city will remain .  
Nonetheless , when you push open one thick , heavy , lacquered door after another , you are welcomed not by some literary or historical figures of the Republican era , but by dazzling and brightly lit restaurants with spacious , modern decor in an " alternative " style .  
It is important to remember that of the types of evidence commonly used in historical research-documents , maps , archeological finds , anthropological tools ( plant life , DNA ) , social structure and language-only documents and maps can be accurately dated and can be used to directly determine historical facts ; the other types can only provide indirect data which , while decisive in supporting documents and maps , in itself can only suggest inferential conclusions .  
Rising almost 4000 meters above sea level , Yushan is not only the tallest peak on Taiwan , it is also the source of the three major river systems that provide water for the island , has the most intact ecological system , verdant forests , varied flowers and fauna plus the nearby historical relics of Patungkuan and the rich cultural history of the Aborigines . " It is natural that this area is a topographical symbol of Taiwanese identity , just like Mt . Fuji in Japan or the Alps in Switzerland , " says Professor Tai .  
It was also at this time that the family adopted corporate management methods . On display alongside the shoulder pole-with its dark , shiny surface hinting at a long history-are a number of other important historical mementos from the company 's past , including a ceiling beam , a brick , and a foundation stone quarried in northern Taipei 's Chili-an district . All these items were taken from the original building before it was torn down to be replaced by the new company headquarters building .  
" Hard " thinking , based on military aggression and economic hegemony , has long dominated the fate and historical development of mankind , several times leading the world to the brink of extinction . Therefore Lu placed special emphasis on the spirit of cooperation and sharing , on " soft thinking " that can lead to win-win situations , pluralism , and mutual coexistence and prosperity . She urged that the Pacific be managed as a " soft ocean " of sustainable development .  
Built to last " This project has struck a balance between using modern preservation techniques and traditional crafts . The utmost effort has been made to restore the original historical appearance of the site , and the careful attention to detail is highly significant in both religious and architectural terms . "  
Hungary is a small nation that al-ways held itself aloof from the rest of the world , but was also plagued by countless calamities , and was time and again " liberated " by foreign nations . After the great catastrophe of the Tatar ( Mongol ) invasion , Hungary enjoyed several centuries of peace and growth . In the 16th century , the Ottoman Turks invaded Hungary , and occupied it for 150 years . The Turks left a historical legacy of Turkish baths and Byzantine architecture , which remain to this day . . . .  
mitterrand and kohl said that europe should not miss the " historical chance " and establish the economic and monetary union and carry out common foreign and security policies in line with the set agenda  
This greatly complicates the future of these countries as they attempt to solve by themselves the difficult economic , political , psychological , cultural and historical problems that they have inherited from the recent past .  
The collapse of empires has let loose the savage impulse to settle historical scores , redress ancient ethnic grievances , and set right real or imagined injustices over national borders , the treatment of minorities , or the control of resources .  
These in turn have allowed open and profound discussions of political questions of common interest to countries united by close historical and cultural ties and by shared sensitivities .  
We pledge that human rights shall be promoted and protected with due regard for the varying historical , political , economic , social , religious and cultural realities of all peoples .  
While no one disputed the universal nature of human rights , it was necessary to take account of the historical , cultural , religious and social situations of each country in order to ensure the effective implementation of such rights .

Recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial Powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation , and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;  
Stress the negative economic consequences of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , conscious that the economic difficulties of Africa can not be explained exclusively by foreign factors and historical events and aware that it is nevertheless a reality that those factors and events have had profound crippling effects on the economic development of Africa and that justice now requires that substantial national and international efforts be made to repair the damage ;  
Affirm that the first logical and credible step to be taken at this juncture of our collective struggle is for the World Conference to declare solemnly that the international community as a whole fully recognizes the historical injustices of the slave trade and that colonialism and apartheid are among the most serious and massive institutionalized forms of human rights violations ;

We recall that , without the necessary political will to recognize and assume responsibility for historical injustices and their contemporary forms and repercussions [ modern slavery and slavery-like practices , ] programmes of action against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as the anti-racist slogans and measures adopted at the World Conference and at the regional and national levels , will not change deeply ingrained prejudices or achieve the noble goal of a genuine human family based on equal dignity and opportunities ;  
[ Calls upon all relevant United Nations organs to endeavour to bring the foreign occupation of Jerusalem by Israel , together with all its racist practices , to an end , and to ensure the recognition of Jerusalem as a city of reverence and religious sanctity for the three major religions of the world which should serve as a focal point of historical and cultural inspiration , a symbol of civilization and religious dialogue and an epitome of tolerance and equality ] ;

The World Conference should acknowledge that differences in ethnic identities have long manifested themselves in diverse ways , but should recognize that the racism of the colonial era constituted an unprecedented system of thought and action that has a specific historical origin in the transatlantic slave trade and the consequent development of the global racial chattel enslavement of Africans .

We must firmly redress the erroneous tendency to neglect ideological and political work and to " pay more attention to material progress than to cultural and ideological progress " in some places and departments ; develop a stronger sense of responsibility and urgency ; and conscientiously pay attention to and step up the effort to solve a series of major issues facing the effort to strengthen and improve ideological and political work , from the perspective of consolidating the party 's status as a ruling party and accomplishing the party 's historical mission .  
However , the " maximum training method " of the missile company raised a historical challenge against the traditional method of launching missiles .  The so-called " maximum training method " is to have launchers engage in strenuous exercise first so their pulse rates will reach about 150 per minute .

This training is designed to assimilate the psychological state of being in a real combat , so as to train the launchers the ability of stabilizing their emotions in a tense situation .  
The eight-point proposal was put forward in good time exactly at such a historical moment , and it therefore evoked great repercussions on both sides of the Taiwan Straits , and among the circles of overseas Chinese and Chinese nationals residing in overseas areas ; meanwhile , the international community also cherished the hope that the two sides of the strait could seize the opportunity to promote their mutual relations , and make contribution to the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region .

The key is that our ideological and political work must adapt to the new situations in China and abroad .  The work must adapt to new changes in our society , politics , economy and cultural lives .  
China is a big country having a cultural origin for 5,000 years .  Under the conditions that the market economic structure was established not long ago , the cultural industry has not taken shape , and the cultural market mechanism has not been perfected , the challenges from opening up China 's cultural markets to the outside world are self-evident , and the opportunities objectively exist too .  The crux of the issue is how the government and enterprises will meet with the challenges and seize hold of the rare historical opportunities .  
Purbu Zhoima said : In view of the unique natural , historical , social , and economic background of the population development in Tibet and its specific evolution process , Tibet 's Provisional Management Procedures on Family Planning stipulate : " Tibet pursues on a trial basis a principle of adherence to spreading propaganda on birth control , quality service , and voluntary choice . "

Though a myriad of contradictions have yet to be tackled and countless difficulties yet to be overcome in the historical process of national rejuvenation through science and education , so long as we forge ahead in face of difficulties and implement the party 's relevant policies in real earnest , our national rejuvenation through science and education is bound to dutifully accomplish its mission by creating new brilliance in the course of the Chinese nation 's great rejuvenation .  
It was precisely in this historical process that the CPC formed the CPPCC by integrating the united front theories of Marxism and Leninism with China 's specific practice .

The speech profoundly points out the existing problems and weak links in educational work , reflects Comrade Jiang Zemin 's great concern and care about education .

He said : Practice has proved that the establishment of a strategic cooperative partnership between China and Russia is indeed a wise choice of historical significance [ li shi xing de zheng que jue ze 2980-0670-1840-4104-2973-4292-2115-2344 ] .  In the new millennium and the new century , the two sides should take a long view and become good neighbors , good partners , and good friends who trust each other , engage in cooperation , and pursue common development .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's remarks have , from a high plane of historical materialism , revealed the fundamental nature of our party ; pointed out the party 's basic tasks ; and are of an important theoretical and practical significance to our efforts to further maintain the advancement of the party , retain the vigor and vitality of the party , lead the whole party and the people of the entire country to carry out struggles in unity , and build our country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized modern socialist power .  
The historical experiences gained by our party in leading the socialist cause have proved , from both the positive and negative aspects , that whenever the party represents the development demands of advanced productive forces , our cause will flourish and grow ;  
Deputy Abdulahat Abdurixit , chairman of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regional People 's Government , stated : Large-scale development of western regions has offered ethnic minorities regions ' development with a historical opportunity unknown in the past , while a stable social environment is the prerequisite for large-scale development , for nothing could be accomplished without a stable social environment . 
Under the condition of developing a socialist market economy , there is an important question for reality and a theoretical question on strengthening the construction of the Party under the new historical conditions : How can our Party from beginning to end maintain its quality of being the vanguard of the working class , how can our Party better represent the necessities for the development of China advanced productive forces , how can our Party represent the development direction of China advanced cultures and how can our Party represent the broad masses interest  
He said : Sichuan Province will seize the historical opportunity brought by the state 's decision on adopting the strategy for great development in China 's west , and will strive to speed up the province 's development at a rate higher than the national average , thus realizing a new leap forward .  The per capita GDP of the province in 2005 will reach the national average level in 2000 ; and will catch up with the national average level in 2010 , thus becoming an economically strong province in the western region .  
The basic spirit of the speech is suited to the county ( or city ) level as well as to the leadership at various levels ; the speech is particularly aimed at improving the ideological and political qualities of leading cadres at various levels ; so it is of great practical and far-reaching historical significance .

The initial stage refers to the historical stage in which the situation of the impoverished population accounting for a large proportion and the people 's living standards being comparatively low will be gradually changed so that the entire people will become comparatively prosperous .  
In socialist construction , areas inhabited by minority nationalities in our country have scored achievements attracting worldwide attention .  Owing to the limitations of natural conditions and for historical reasons , however , there is still a certain gap between the minority-nationality regions and the more developed inland and eastern coastal areas in the levels of economic and cultural development .  
Since the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central Committee , we have worked to sum up historical experience , to carry out reform and opening , to concentrate on economic construction , thereby generating unprecedented development of the productive forces , tremendous improvement in comprehensive national capability , marked improvement in people 's lives , and comprehensive social progress .  
The important speech given by President Jiang at the Plenary Session of the PLA Representative Troops fully affirms the achievements made by the military and armed police troops and raises clear requirements for comprehensively promoting the construction of military modernization .  The speech emphasizes that the military must further clearly understand the historical mission it shoulders and provide firm and strong assurance of security for protecting the country 's sovereignty , unity and security , for protecting the people 's labor under peaceful conditions and for reform , opening up and the construction of socialist modernization .  
Only our Party has these important responsibilities .  Our military is the people 's military under the resolute leadership of the Party . Whether or not the military 's Party organizations are firm and strong , whether or not they can become firm fighting forces and whether or not they can play the role of the " Three Representations " are significant to whether or not we can solve the 2 historical tasks , " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's nature . "  
Leading cadres at all levels must fully understand the historical responsibilities they shoulder and strengthen their sense of concern of being prepared for danger in times of peace and their sense of their fundamental functions .  They must further strengthen their initiative and sense of urgency in their study and strive to study scientific theories and scientific and technological knowledge with a spirit of seizing every minute .  They must continuously heighten their political quality , theoretical level and ability in commanding modern wars .  
Particularly in the new historical period , our military is implementing a new period of military strategies and principles in a positive way , moving along the road of quality construction and of making the military strong with science and technology , and striving to complete two historical tasks of " winning wars " and " not changing the military 's quality . "  Deep changes are taking place in various aspects of military construction and new people , new events and new trends worthy of being recorded with letters of gold have emerged in large numbers .  
[ Shi Guangsheng ] Because of historical reasons and natural conditions , the economic foundation of the western region is quite weak .  The overall development level there is evidently much lower than that in the eastern region .  The gap between the two regions in the scale and level of the development of foreign trade and economic cooperation is also quite big .  
This should be of important theoretical and practical significance to our party under the new historical conditions in further strengthening self building , always maintaining advanced nature , leading the people of the whole country in waging concerted struggles , pushing forward reform and opening up and modernization building , and realizing the magnificent transcentury objectives .  
Under the new historical conditions , through summing up the historical experiences since the founding of the party , Comrade Jiang Zemin made a new , comprehensive , and complete epitome of the advanced nature of the party .  During the periods of revolution , construction , and reform , our party has always represented the development needs of advanced social productive forces in China , the forward direction of advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people .  
The expositions of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has comprehensively revealed the historical connection between the correct leadership of the party and developing social productive forces , flourishing advanced culture , and realizing the fundamental interests of the masses of people .  
And in the new historical period only by maintaining and bringing into play this kind of advanced nature can our party continue pushing forward the emancipation and development of social productive forces , promoting the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of national economy , and eventually realizing the dream of making the country powerful .  
The reason for China needing a communist party and the reason for the communist party succeeding in mounting China 's social and political stage and displaying great historical roles is exactly because that the communist party can meet the needs of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture , and fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people in China .  
It has been proven by historical experiences that without the heartfelt endorsement and vigorous support of the broad masses of people , our Party could not possibly have developed from a weak and small beginning into a strong and large force and displayed decisive historical roles in putting an end to the situation of China being carved up by foreign powers and laboring people being oppressed and exploited by reactionary ruling classes and in the struggles of changing the look of poverty and backwardness in China .  
Meanwhile , under the new historical conditions we are required to comprehensively push forward the ideological , organizational , and stylistic building of the Party and truly maintain and display the advanced nature of the Party on the basis of correctly mastering and handling the relationship of dialectical unity between the advanced nature of ourselves and the extensiveness of our contacts with the masses .  
A pressing task of the moment for all local authorities in the western region is to remove administrative barriers as soon as possible , break up the structure of separating the markets between localities and trades , clear away all obstacles to market entry , and create a unified and open market environment for fair competition , thus grasping the new historical opportunity for the great development of the western region .  
Introducing able personnel from other parts of the country is , no doubt , a major channel ; yet it is more practical and more economical to arouse the potentialities of existing scientific and technological personnel inside the region .  Besides , the large-scale development of the western region has also provided a rare historical opportunity for the able personnel in the military industry to attain greater accomplishments in their career .  
This reporter has learned from the meeting that under the present circumstances wherein its economy still remains underdeveloped , China has succeeded , thanks to its hard efforts in recent years , in bringing an unduly fast population growth under effective control ; its total fertility rate among women of child-bearing age has dropped below the supersedure level ; and the country 's population reproduction mode has experienced a historical change to one of " low birthrate , low death rate , and low growth . "  
In the new historical period , our party must always meet the requirements in the development of the advanced social productive forces in China , adhere to the advancing orientation of China 's progressive culture , and faithfully represent the fundamental interests of the broadest majority of the Chinese people , and a basic and decisive condition for this is that the party must persistently arm the minds of the entire membership and rally the people with the correct ideal and belief .  
In the past , we won great victories in revolution and construction by overcoming tremendous difficulties and dangers , because our party persistently educated party members , guided the masses , united people 's minds , and boosted people 's morale with the lofty ideal and with the objectives for the struggle in every historical stage .  
The correct ideal and belief will not come into people 's minds from nothing .  It is based on the arming of people 's minds with the Marxist theory , and based on people 's clear understanding and correct mastery of the objective law that governs social historical development and the correct outlook on life under the guidance of the scientific theory .  
To be sure , Tibet 's falling behind by far the country 's average development standard is due to both historical and natural factors .  However , we must not lay the blame on objective factors alone .  After all we need to calmly and realistically analyze subjective and operational factors as well .  
All provinces and autonomous regions in the western region must conform their ideology and actions to the policy decisions and work arrangements of the central authorities .  Not only should they fully understand and firmly grasp this rare historical opportunity , enhance their sense of urgency and mission , meet difficulties head-on , and forge ahead with vigorous efforts ; but they should also see clearly that the development gap in the western region is a result of historical reasons formed over a long period of time ;  
The Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee decided to shift the focus of the party 's work onto economic development .  This correctly grasped the main contradiction in the initial stage of socialism , and was a significant political decision on fulfilling the party 's historical mission and building ours into a powerful socialist country .  
Chen Yaobang said : Due to various reasons , such as natural and historical reasons , agricultural and rural economic developments in the western region have been lagging behind and the average per capita income of peasants is quite low .  
The people from the eastern , central , and western regions have reached a consensus : The grand western development is not only a historical turning point for the people of the western region to rouse themselves to catch up with the developed region and narrow the gap between them , but also a huge space for the eastern region to further its prosperity and development .  It is a common opportunity for both the eastern and western regions in China .  
This is a historical event in the north-south relations since the split on the Korean Peninsula 55 years ago .  As a new bright spot for the south and the north to head toward peace , reconciliation and cooperation , the meeting is welcome and worth being supported .  
At the same time , while protecting the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups , the governments must respect the universal principle concerning human rights acknowledged by the international community and also have the right to adopt measures that commensurate with their own national conditions in the light of their own realities because historical background , cultural tradition , development level , and nationality composition vary from country to country .  
The 15th National Party Congress has formulated the strategic program of gearing the construction of a socialism with Chinese characteristics to the 21st century .  The completion of this new historical task depends on the leading groups and the leading cadres at all levels , on the continuous upgrading of their leadership standard and government standard , and on the continuous strengthening of their ability to resist corruption and degeneration , and on their work to further solidify the party and the people , so that together we can struggle to move forward with our grand undertaking .  
After the Cold War , peace and development have become major topics that are of common concern to peoples of all nations in the world .  In this situation , Japan has not made more contributions to world peace and development , but has instead used all its armed might to indulge in wars of aggression , expanded its armament without restraint , and attempted to elevate its international status and political and economic interests as a military power .  This obviously runs counter to the historical trend .  
Using network resources and conducting research on the question of launching a people 's war on the net are of strong practical significance in making good preparations for military struggle .  In addition , they are also of profound and far-reaching historical significance in developing the strategic ideology of launching people 's war .  
Zhang Lichang , secretary of the municipal party committee , said that leading cadres at all levels must stand at the high plain of historical development to fully understand the urgency of implementing the important concept of " three represents " in close connection with the profound changes in the domestic and international situation and with the actual conditions of Tianjin 's work , further emancipate people 's minds , further break new ground and make new progress , grasp opportunities , and develop by leaps and bounds .  
As we all know , the founders of Marxism always approached the revolutionary spirit , the historical mission , and the source of strength of both the proletariat and their political parties in different countries from the angle of their relationship with the emergence and development of socialized productive forces represented by the big industry in both modern and contemporary times .  
The advancedness of our party is rooted in the historical position of China 's working class which represents the development demands of the social productive forces of our time ; and which is tempered , cultivated , and formed in the protracted struggle .  
Obviously , such an advancedness is not an abstract concept ; but has been given an historical , concrete , and comprehensive expression by the " three represents , " in other words , by the theories , programs , policies , and practices in the three aspects of representing the development demands of China 's advanced social productive forces , the orientation of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the vast numbers of the people .  
Only when our party leads and brings along the masses to fulfill the historical mission of " three represents " in real terms amidst social changes and social progresses can it be able to keep to the correct orientation of the party building ; and can it improve its own quality , consolidate its organizational building , and enhance its fighting capacity during the process of playing a dynamic role in transforming the objective world and in pushing forward social progress .  
Leading cadres at all levels must arm themselves fully with Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important exposition ; willingly enhance their sense of historical responsibility and urgency ; broaden their horizons ; work hard and keep forging ahead ; foster a scientific spirit ; master scientific methods ; learn knowledge about science ; and persist in working hard unremittingly on the basis of what has been achieved so far .  They must make efforts to further improve their ideological and cultural quality ;  
Wang Ke pointed out : The important speech , which Chairman Jiang made from a strategic height and after having reviewed the whole situation , is a scientific summation of our party 's historical experience , a deep revelation of the inherent laws governing the work of party building , and an enrichment and development of Mao Zedong 's and Deng Xiaoping 's thoughts on party building .  It has further pointed out the direction of party building in the new period and has a high theoretical and ideological level and a guiding function .  
He revised the draft resolution over and over again , wrote such important sections as the " Cultural Revolution " by himself , fully implemented what was demanded by the second-generation leading collective with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the core , seriously summed up the historical experience , correctly evaluated Mao Zedong and Mao Zedong Thought , and made a major contribution to reaching a Party-wide common understanding .  
Nevertheless , Taiwan , being a typical hilly island and surrounded by the sea , is narrow in space and lacks strategic depth .  Crowded with 23-million people , the 36,000 square kilometer island is absolutely unable to resist forced entry by a power .  At the moment , the Taiwan authorities are going against the historical trend .  
The important concept of " three represents " put forward by General Secretary Jiang is an in-depth summing-up of historical experiences in the building of our party , a scientific generalization of the party 's nature , aims , and tasks , and new requirements set for party building in the new period .  It embodies the distinct characteristics of the times and is of profound ideological and scientific guiding significance .  
During our major political struggle against " Falun Gong , " some veteran comrades who had been party members for many years were confused by its false reasoning and heresy .  This fact profoundly shows that in new historical conditions , the struggle between right and wrong , between the advanced and the backward , between science and superstition , and between civilization and ignorance in the ideological sphere appears to be ever more complicated .  
We must regard the study and implementation of this important thinking a fundamental approach to and a long-term strategic mission for enhancing party organizations ' cohesion and combat strength , for ensuring the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and for accomplishing the two historical tasks of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration . "  We must make unremitting efforts to study and implement this important thinking so as to improve party building in the armed forces and raise the standards of military construction in all areas .  
In the march toward the new century , in order to conscientiously implement Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement on the " three represents " and " comprehensively advance party building around the two major historical topics , that is , constantly raising our leading and governing ability and improving our ability to guard against corruption and degeneration and withstand risks , " it is necessary to thoroughly implement the principle of strictly administering the party and satisfactorily resolve the ideological , organizational , and work style problems that exist in our party .  
In the great tide of world peace and development , the historical handshake of the Korean peninsula 's leaders from the north and south not only broke through the solid ice and opened the road for the Korean nation 's independent [ zizhu ] peaceful unification , it also created a beneficial environment and conditions for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula , in the northeast Asian region , and the world .  
Practice in the three major political struggles showed : The mission of ideological and political construction in the army under the new historical condition , as proposed by the All-Army Political Work Conference , is of extreme significance to providing a powerful spiritual motivation for " winning our fight " , and to providing a reliable political guarantee for " not deteriorating " .  
Faced with the new situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and high technology is being applied extensively in the military field , our army should train a large number of new-type military personnel who are militarily and politically competent and who have acquired good command of modern scientific and cultural knowledge .  This is the key for our army to gain the initiative in future military struggles and shoulder the historical missions entrusted by the party and the people .  
This theme defined at the turn of the century has expressed the strong desire of the people nationwide for treasuring the land and protecting the cultivated land at the historical moment when they are marching toward the new century .  It is also the historical choice of the Chinese nation in order to survive and multiply and to grow and flourish .  
Owing to various factors , such as historical and geographic conditions , most of our country 's key economic bases are distributed in economically developed coastal areas , areas with transport facilities , and large and medium-sized inland cities .  Thus , it will be easy for enemies to destroy in a concentrated manner our closely distributed economic bases .  
The CPC unites and leads the entire people of all nationalities throughout the country to carry out dauntless struggle .  The party dedicated numerous outstanding members , and eventually defeated imperialist aggressors , overthrew the " three big mountains " on the backs of the Chinese people , and opened up a new historical era in which the Chinese people are masters of their own country and independently develop socialism .  
The protracted nature of ideological and political work is determined by the fact that it will take a process of considerably long historical struggle to achieve the grand objective of socialist modernization and it is not plain sailing because many difficulties and problems will crop up in the course of our advance .  
In particular , during the magnificent 20th century , the people of Asia were indomitable in going all out to make their countries strong , composing a magnificent historical epic of their political awakening and economic upsurge and giving a powerful impetus to historical progress and social development .  
The ossified " Soviet model " took the experience and development course of socialist construction under a special historical condition as something absolute and sacred without regard to the need to make continuous innovations inside socialism across different stages of development .  As a result , this seriously hindered the development of productivity , made it impossible to improve the people 's living conditions over a long time , and went against the requirements determined by the nature of socialism .  
The thinking of persisting in the " three represents " under the new historical conditions has clearly defined the political direction , political standard , and political requirement for the building of our military ; and is of an extremely important and far-reaching significance to strengthening the party 's ideological leadership , political leadership , and organizational leadership over the military , and to ensuring that our military can forever march forward under the banner of the party and can always retain the nature and the aim of a people 's military .  
To make it simple , that is to " ensure the correct direction and to produce skilled students " .  This task is based on basic requirements and the historical mission that Chairman Jiang imposed on military schools for ideological and political construction in the new stage .  
Especially when we face the corrosion and influence of false ideas prevailing in society , constant adjustments in the relationships of public interests and the urgent task of preparing for military struggles , we should find an answer to and resolve the historical issues of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " and should have new and more demanding standards for implementation of the " program " and for the strengthening of grassroots construction .  
We soon had an interview with Che Guevara , and obtained a lot of inside information from Carlos Rafael Rodriguez , head of the daily newspaper Hoy . Confined by objective historical conditions and delicate and complicated international relations , however , we found that many of the questions could not be reported openly .  
Reform and opening up is a historical policy decision determining the fate of contemporary China . This great practice has not only greatly liberated and developed productive forces , but also greatly emancipated people 's minds , deeply transformed the mental outlook of the masses of people , and promoted the constant progress of social thinking .  
Over the last 20 years or so , the broad masses of the people have emancipated their minds and acted on an unprecedented historical initiative and proceeded from a highly developed sense of responsibility for realizing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation to offer ideas and contribute methods for the reform and opening up and undertakings of modernization drive and actively study new situations and resolve new issues in the light of the actual conditions .  
At the time of great social changes taking place and during a special historical era of moving from a closed society to an opened society , people should experience bigger fluctuations in ideology and mentality .  They might feel confused and incomprehensible about the new social phenomena which are constantly emerging or even make deviations and errors in understanding .  All these should eventually be resolved in practice through relying on the self-education of the masses .  
This requires that creators of literary and artistic works should persistently focus on realistic topics when choosing between historical and realistic ones , and focus on military-oriented topics when choosing between military-oriented topics and non-military ones .  These creators should be enthusiastically concerned about the great process of military construction , firmly take the pulse of life in military camps , and make our excellent spiritual products the satisfactory guide in creating literary and artistic works .  
During the period of the " Ninth 5-Year " Plan , the historical opportunity of expanding domestic demands and implementing active financial policies was seized .  Through issuing national debt and expanding investments , we have concentrated efforts to build a batch of major projects and fulfilled some big projects which we had always wanted to fulfill but failed .  The agricultural , forestry , and water conservancy construction has noticeably quickened .  
The people are relieved to see that with the convocation of the UN millennium summit and the " Chinese Cultural Exhibition in the United States " , as well as the large-scale cultural exchange activities which are being held in the United States nationwide like a raging fire , the main US media , including the " New York Times " and the " Washington Post " , have " broken historical records " in frequently reporting on China 's relevant situations .  
The Chinese people made arduous exploration for half a century to go through this process .  They achieved major successes , and they had also experienced many twists and turns or even paid high prices before they could basically accomplish at last an organic integration of the universality and particularity of socialism under new historical conditions , and begin to figure out the right path of socialist development that suits China 's national conditions .  
On the one hand , we firmly retained many practices that were not socialist ones but restraints to development of the productive forces , or those which were only applicable to certain special historical conditions .  We claimed such practices to be " socialist principles " , but actually they were not .  On the other hand , we mistook for " capitalist practices " many things that were conducive to the development of productive forces under socialist conditions , and so we repudiated them .  
The people 's democratic dictatorship as a form of state and the people 's congress system as a form of government of what our country has been pursuing are the result of the people 's struggle and a historical choice made by the people .  They are the corner stone of our country 's political system which not only suits our country 's national conditions but also reflects the substantive requirements of socialism .  
As theoretical workers of socialist countries , we should conscientiously sum up the experience left over by the practice and exploration of socialism in the 20th century .  We should take the summarization of this rich theoretical heritage as our solemn historical mission , make our unique contributions to upholding and developing Marxism , and thus provide a better guidance to practice and exploration of socialism in the 21st century .  
However , the Vatican has turned black into white by " canonizing " these sinners , who had a notorious record , in an attempt to reverse the historical fact of the imperialist aggression against China . This act has severely hurt the feelings of the Chinese people and is intolerable to every religious believer who loves his country .  
In the long years of revolutionary war and socialist construction , especially at important historical junctures , he firmly supported the party 's correct leadership and steadfastly implemented the party 's line , principles , and policies , demonstrating a Communist 's steadfast faith in communism and noble revolutionary quality .  
In this way , they have effectively solved the difficult problem of insufficient sustained supporting strength for the airborne troops , and the airborne troops now have reliable " mobile warehouses " .  This indicates the airborne troops have taken a historical leap forward from being able to air-drop troops alone to being able to conduct combined operations .  
The flames of the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea disappeared nearly 50 years ago .  Unprecedented changes have taken place in the international political structure and the world military arena .  However , the valuable experience gained from this war cuts through space-time , exceeds national boundaries , and becomes an extensive and precious historical textbook .  
Now , the initial form of socialist market economy has been established , but the historical mission of social system transition remains to be completed .  For example , some enterprises are still unable to meet the development demands of market economy , the operating mechanism is not active , the capability for technical innovation is not strong ;  
These three friendly neighboring countries all possess tropical or subtropical scenery , folk customs and ways which are different from China 's , brilliant and splendid civilizations , and numerous historical stories and legends about their friendly intercourse with China .  
At the Party Central Committee 's conference on ideological and political work , Comrade Jiang Zemin noted that , " to do the ideological and political work well in the new period , we must profoundly analyze both the objective environment and the characteristics of the thinking of the larger number of cadres and the masses in the new situation from international , domestic , historical and realistic perspectives .  We must correctly examine and solve significant problems in both theory and reality that are influential to the thinking of cadres and the masses .  
This important directive was made from a long-term and broad perspective , through both dialectical materialism and historical materialism , and with an eye on the requirements for the development of the times .  This directive has set the direction for strengthening and improving ideological and political work in the new period .  
Both the north and the south have made firm steps toward the relaxation of tension and reconciliation on the peninsula .  Viewed from an historical angle , this is just the beginning of the long road toward peaceful reunification .  With the trend of easing tension and the acceleration in cooperation and exchange , the " agreement on truce " signed during the Cold War period can no longer meet the development and changes of the big trend in the international arena .  
From this we can see that thoroughgoingly criticizing the reactionary " historical concept of being a nation of divinity , " eliminating the pernicious influence of the pre-war education that deified Mikado , rooting out the hotbed of militarism once and for all , and gaining a correct understanding of the development history and culture of the Japanese nation is key to ensuring that Japan , which has already become an economic power , will always follow a path of peaceful development and will be accepted by its neighboring countries and by the vast numbers of Asian nations .  
Even though the socialist movement experienced grave setbacks , its banner was still flying high above the Earth . These are not random historical phenomena but a vivid embodiment of an objective regularity of social development .  
With the passage of time , the sequence of historical evolution became even more discernible , and the inevitable occurrence of this historical phenomenon became even clearer : first , the development of capitalism got all countries involved in the capitalist system , and as developed capitalist countries were engaged in the export of commodities and capital , they at the same time exported their internal contradictions , the human suffering brought along by capitalism .  
At the same time , understanding and mastering these laws is a process where subjective and objective factors converge .  In reality , this convergence frequently has experienced the interference and impact of various factors .  That is why mastering the laws of the building of socialism takes repeated exploration and experimentation and is a historical process that is sure to be prolonged and complicated .  
Holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping theory , continuing to step up the building of democracy and the legal system , and building China into a country ruled by law having a high degree of socialist democracy and a sound socialist legal system , are an important assurance for the Chinese nation to realize the grand goal of rejuvenation , as well as an important contribution of the Chinese nation to mankind 's historical progress .  
Some Western capitalist countries are trying to bring the process of historical development in the world onto the path they design by making use of the increasingly frequent and close international relations and exchanges and by making use of their political , economic , scientific , technological , and military advantages .  
In the current international circumstances which are undergoing profound changes , while concentrating our strength on advancing the modernization drive and continuing to open up to the outside world , we must keep ourselves sober-headed against the infiltration of the Western ideology .  An important thing we should do is to persistently apply the dialectical materialist and historical materialist point of view to observe the complicated social phenomena .  
Therefore , the military is facing considerable arduous tasks and many obvious difficulties : the military construction and development lack sufficient funds and their weaponry and armament are still yet to be modernized ; the military also faces great changes in its historical , social and objective environments ; the quality of military professionals is far from meeting the requirements for the modernization construction ;  
We should excel at understanding historical development trends and walk on the cutting edge of the times .  We should also be skillful in basing everything in reality , formulating the correct policies and strategies for development and be consistently innovative in theory , systems , science and technology in order to develop every project in modernization construction in a health , fast and sustainable way in the new century .  
During the 20th century which has just passed , scientific and technological progress brought about unprecedented development to the civilization of mankind .  Today , the Chinese nation is faced with a historical opportunity of comprehensive rejuvenation ; and the realization of a peaceful reunification across the strait is an inexorable demand of cross-strait economic , social , and cultural development .  We hope that the leaders of the Taiwan authorities can face up to the reality ; comply with the historical trend of the time ;  
Despite Li Hongzhi 's wild boasting and loud preaching about the series of absurd beliefs that he has created , facts speak louder than words .  In the light of dialectical materialism and historical materialism , his reactionary and decadent nature is abundantly clear .  
refining and distilling the ruling party 's " governing " policy and historical mission of developing productive forces and culture and realizing the people 's interests in such a way as to make them the ruling party 's fundamental guiding principle on " administering the party " has answered the important historical questions of " what kind of party we should build and how we should build our party " ; all this has raised Marxist party building theory to a higher level .  
But , we should also realize that any fundamental , continual social and historical change is always accompanied by interactions between the mainstream and the tributaries , struggles between the positive and negative sides and between the progressive and backward sides , and influence and constraints from various internal and external factors , resulting a situation of unprecedented diversity and complexity .  
Countless Party members and revolutionary military professionals would dedicate everything in them to liberating the Chinese nation , bringing happiness to the people and revitalizing the country .  The reform , opening up and the development of the socialist market economy have added enormous vitality and historical progress to our construction of material and spiritual civilizations .  
To satisfactorily answer and solve the historical topics of " winning wars " and " eradicating corruption " in the new situation , our military must construct all grassroots units including " small , remote , scattered and directly administered " units into strong fighting groups .  
Western countries headed by the United States always draw an ideological line by only recognizing western value standards and human rights concepts , and they want every country to completely copy their ways , irrespective of their historical traditions and level of social and economic development .  This has already caused social turmoil and even war in certain African countries .  
Since the 20 years of reform and opening up , we have attached prime importance to people 's right of existence in accordance with China 's national conditions , succeeded in realizing two historical leaps - - moving from poverty to having enough food and clothing and then to leading a comparatively comfortable life , and achieved comprehensive economic and social development .  World-shaking changes have taken place in China 's human rights situation , and China has been generally praised by the international community for these changes .  
Deputies Shi Yuxiao and Zhang Guochu held that today , facing the new task of regarding economic construction as the central task , the important thinking of Comrade Jiang Zemin on " three represents " has given a highly refined interpretation in fundamentally answering the questions of how to build the party , what kind of party to build , and how to act well as the " force at the core " in leading the cause of socialist modernization in the new historical conditions .  
The good situation has been pioneered by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the party .  The ideological and political foundation , the material and technical foundation , and the mass foundation , that we have already possessed to realize the three major historical tasks in the new situation , have been laid by the people of the whole country under the leadership of the party .  
Thereby , the key to consolidating and developing the current gratifying situation , realizing objectives in the Outline of the 10th Five-Year Plan , and fulfilling the three major historical tasks in the new century hinges on further implementing the important thinking of the " three represents " as put forward by Comrade Jiang Zemin . Besides , the party should achieve its ideological and organizational construction , improve its work styles , and ceaselessly improve its leadership , its ruling level , and its capability of resisting corruption and preventing peaceful evolution .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin has scientifically summed up the historical experiences of the world socialist movement and of our party in leading the Chinese revolution and construction , and creatively put forward the important thinking on " three represents , " thus answering in scientific fashion a series of major issues that we face in stepping up party building in the new situation .  
Deputies pledged to carry forward the spirit of incessant struggle advocated by President Jiang , have a high sense of political and historical responsibility , strengthen army building in an all-round way , and score good results in the two historical subjects of " winning the battle " and " never changing color " .  
Deputy Chen Jinbiao noted : Under the present new historical conditions , to judge whether the building of party organizations in the military has been reinforced , our ultimate criterion is to see whether the coherent force and the fighting capacity of the party organizations at all levels have been reinforced ; and whether the role of party committees as a leading core , the role of party branches as a powerful fighting force , and the exemplary vanguard role of party members have all been brought into full play .  
The aforementioned three criteria can more or less provide a basic yardstick for the general public who are concerned with things of this category ; and if we view the matter against a more extensive historical background , we can see that orthodox religions also showed a number of imperfect factors down the ages .  
Political restructuring and the development of the socialist democracy and political system must be conducive to maintaining and giving play to the features and advantages of our political system , and conducive to maintaining the unity of the country , ethnic unity and social stability .  In addition , the historical conditions and the level of economic , cultural and educational development must also be taken into full consideration .  
While entering into the new historical era , Chairman Jiang showed great foresight and stood on the high altitude of strategy and overall situation to have put forth the general requirements of five phrases of " being up to standard in politics , perfect in mastering military skills , excellent in work styles , highly disciplined , and effective in safeguard " , which has clearly pointed out the forward direction for strengthening the all-round grass-roots building .  
It is necessary to act according to the requirements of the " three represents " to earnestly study and resolve the new situations and new issues encountered in the building of party organizations under the new historical condition of reform and opening up and developing the socialist market economy and conduct education for maintaining the advanced nature of the party with targets in mind , so as to let party branches at grass-roots level possess very strong capability in directing the overall building of companies and resolving their own problems and party member truly display an exemplary role .  
We have discussed , from a theoretical and historical perspective , the great importance of social and intellectual differentiation resulting from China 's economic reform led by the political authorities to China 's future political democratization ; however , it must also be pointed out that the inherent defects in a post-totalitarian system and reformist model have also created a series of difficulties .  
However , at the initial stage of socialism , with the distinct characteristics of dual economic structures for the villages and the cities , and with deeply-settled historical and cultural traditions involving small-scale peasant economies in the villages , the cultural and technology quality of the peasants has remained low and many peasants do not understand or are not accustomed to the market economy .  
Through agreat historical change , China thoroughly terminated its miserable history ofbeing victimized by foreign aggression and becoming weak and poor , and beganthe new process of making the people rich and making the nation strong .  
International public opinion has focused on the fact that in this book approved by the Japanese Government , the " New History Textbook Writing Committee " has , under the slogan of making some " corrections to Japanese history textbooks ' tendency toward national abuse , " distorted historical facts and completely whitewashed its invasive war , denying the serious crimes that Japan committed during World War II . Although the manuscript was revised 137 times , its contents are still far from historical fact .  
In the 1982 and 1986 revisions to history textbooks , which twisted the facts and beautified aggressive warfare , a wave of opposition was stirred up both in Asian nations and within Japan . The Japanese press was somewhat more sensitive in their assessment of the textbook , immediately reporting that the new History Textbook Committee had used the excuse that there was national abuse in the existing middle school history textbooks to lead in writing a prettified history textbook which glorifies an imperialist historical view .  
Fu Quanyou expounded the development process and historical causes of the world 's new military revolution , analyzed the essential features and profound impact of the revolution , and explicitly put forth our Army 's major counter measures to meet the challenges from the world 's new military revolution .  
Different countries differ not only in their geographical location but also in their level of economic development and historical and cultural traditions .  Thus , they are bound to have different political , economic and social systems , and it is unrealistic to achieve unification using one and the same model .  
The " three advantages " criterion constitutes the standard for us to judge all our work in carrying out China 's reform and opening-up program and developing the socialist modernization drive .  In this way , the thinking on " three represents " helps set the goals for party building in the new period , and expand the historical mission of the Communist Party of China in the new period .  It also provides a theoretical guidance to the ruling party for further strengthening its cultural , social , and economic foundations .  
Due to the constraints of historical and geographical factors , the level of economic and social development in some areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups is comparatively backward .  
The entire process of the incident was connected to historical , legal , cultural , language , and religious issues , and the only thing that was conspicuously absent was its military aspect .  US Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did not even appear in public during the development of the incident .  It was not until 13 April that he held a news conference at which he complained that it was only the Chinese Communist plane 's provocative act that was the underlying cause of the collision .  
Jiang Zemin said : Venezuela is a country with beautiful mountains and rivers and rich natural resources .  The diligent and courageous Venezuelan people are endowed with glorious historical traditions .  At present , under the leadership of President Chavez , the Venezuelan Government and people are making vigorous efforts to push forward political , economic , and social reform ;  
When new China was established , for historical reasons the mother mainland laid particular stress on putting politics in command and emphasized ideology ; it violated the laws of economic development , and in particular this went to extremes during the " 10-year cultural revolution , " causing great damage to the social productive forces and bringing the national economy to the brink of bankruptcy . 
Li Zhaoxing finally said : President Jiang 's visit to Latin America is one of historical significance , for it has forcefully furthered the Sino-Latin American friendly cooperation in an all-round way in the new century ; has expanded China 's influence in the world ; and is of vital significance and far-reaching influence to enhancing unity and cooperation among the broad masses of developing countries and to facilitating the establishment of new , fair , and reasonable political and economic order in the world .  
Hu Jintao said : Since its founding , the Communist Party of Vietnam has always adhered to and upheld Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chih Ming Thought , maintained the leadership of the Communist Party , firmly kept to the path of socialism , triumphantly realized national liberation and reunification , scored remarkable achievements in socialist construction , especially in the cause of reform over the past 15 years , and led the Vietnamese people into a new historical period of building an industrialized and modernized country .  
We must strengthen our building of leadership teams , keep our objectives firmly in mind , strengthen Party spirit , consider the situation as a whole , unite closely , fulfill promises , strive to implement the Party line , have an effective and strong ideological level , political awareness and professional capability , building a strong leadership collective capable of bearing its historical responsibility .  
The large body of young writers keep in step with the times , pay close attention to reality , engage themselves in the practices of the masses , devote themselves to literary creation , present numerous excellent works with both the flavor of the times and historical substance , as well as with definite ideological depth and artistic appeal .  
The Chinese working class is indeed the representative of advanced social productive forces and production relations , is indeed the basic driving force that promotes social development and historical advances , is indeed the main force in the building of socialist material and spiritual civilization , and is indeed the leading class of the people 's republic .  
We must always adhere to the Marxist viewpoint of historical materialism , firmly adopt the basic viewpoint that only people are the driving force for creating history , give wider publicity to the need to further enhance the status and role of the working class , greatly carry forward the great contemporary spirit of the working class , use the advanced ideas and model conduct of the working class to influence and lead all other sectors of our society , continuously consolidate and enhance the master status of the broad working masses .  
Meanwhile , the book must also make a comprehensive , profound , and accurate summarization of the historical experiences and lessons that our army has gained and learned from its building , so as to serve as an important historical reference in the course of strengthening national defense , promoting army building , and making sound preparations for military struggles .  
Chi Haotian urged the compilers of the military history to ensure a sound quality for the entire book by taking the attitude of holding themselves responsible for history , the party , the people , the officers and men , and for the revolutionaries of the older generation ; and to make sure that the military history they are compiling is a faithful historical account , as well as an accurate " Historical Record , " of our army that can be handed down to future generations .  
Putin emphasized : President Jiang Zemin 's visit to Russia is a major event in Russian-Chinese relations this year ; and it has extremely important practical and historical significance .  I am very delighted to be able to have a thorough exchange of views with President Jiang on ways to continuously enrich and deepen the strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries , and to promote and strengthen bilateral cooperation in world affairs in the coming century .  
The Taiwan leader , however , disregarding the historical fact and the universal demand of the compatriots on both sides of the strait , has fabricated the " 1992 spirit " of " a consensus that is devoid of consensus " and the so-called " setting aside the controversial dialogue and exchange , " in an attempt to negate and change the existing foundation of the two organizations ' talks and to set up a serious roadblock to the cross-strait talks .  
A correct understanding of the strategic developments and changes under the new historical conditions , a scientific strategic outlook , and , in particular , a broader and more profound strategic vision and more enterprising strategic thinking are indispensable to understanding the basic trend of strategic developments .  
While seizing the historical opportunities and concentrating strength on advancing modernization , we must also be soberly aware that the contemporary world is still not peaceful though the situation is easing on the whole , and the parity of international strength is seriously imbalanced .  Hegemonism and power politics still exist and make new developments in the fields of international politics , economy , and security .  Military interventionism has further increased .  
While trying to seize the historical opportunities and concentrating resources on modernization , we must also be soberly aware that though the current world situation is moving toward relaxation on the whole , this planet is far from being peaceful ; there is a serious imbalance in international forces ; hegemonism and power politics are still existing and have gained fresh ground in international political , economic , and security domains ;  
Now facing the 21st century , we must adhere to the theme of development , focus on economic construction as the central task unswervingly , work hard to realize the " four modernizations , " and accomplish the historical mission of the great renaissance of the Chinese nation .  To achieve this grand goal , we must make energetic efforts to improve the basic quality of the whole people .  
The Dalai 's destruction of Tibetan-sect Buddhism also finds conspicuous expression in the fact that he has openly violated the established historical practice and religious rules and obstructed and undermined the work of locating and deciding on the reincarnated soul boy of the 10th Panchen by presumptuously announcing from abroad the ceincarnated soul boy of the Panchen , ?  
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi commented today at a press conference that China is carrying out a peaceful policy of foreign diplomacy in which independence and initiative is maintained .  This will aid in protecting and advancing peace and stability in the Asia Pacific region as well as in the world .  No matter how military planning is strengthened , advocacy of containment of China is contrary to the historical trend and is entirely wrong and will get nowhere .  
Compelled by public opinion at home and abroad , the textbook that in April had been determined to be " up to standard " by the Japanese Ministry for Education , Culture , Sports , Science , and Technology , had several thousand errors revised recently .  However , the revision avoided the important and dwelled on the trivial .  Descriptions that distort history and beautify aggression have not been revised , and the textbook still adopts the basic theme of advocating the " historical view of the Japanese Empire . "  
With the full support of Internet technology , the website has adopted an advanced databank structure and developed the function of multiple search , thus ensuring on-line audiovisual broadcast of an increased amount of pictures and precious historical materials , whose pictures and texts look excellent .  
However , this writer is of the opinion that the United States ' current military deployment in the Asia-Pacific region still is in a kind of historical continuation status - - there have not been any major changes in terms of quantity and quality .  Whether or not the United States will continue to adopt a " Cold War Forward Strategy " in its new strategic plan and step up its direct military presence around China are yet to be observed and studied .  
Li Liguo noted : On 23 May 1951 , the Central People 's Government and the former local government of Tibet signed a 17-clause " Agreement on Procedures Concerning the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet " ; and the People 's Liberation Army entered Tibet , drove out imperialist forces , and brought true both the peaceful liberation of Tibet and the unification of the mainland motherland .  This was a major event in China 's modern and contemporary history , and a natural and epoch-making turning point in the historical development of Tibet .  
While intensifying the aversion of most countries in the world to varying degrees , the so-called " unilateralism , " which is criticized by many countries , has also prompted many people of insight in the world to begin pondering numerous profound and lasting historical philosophic , political , and cultural issues , such as that in the new century , how different countries , different systems , and different cultures should make use of each other 's strong points for reference and respect each other ;  
After Tibet 's peaceful liberation , under the leadership of the CPC , people of different ethnic backgrounds in Tibet created a socialist miracle on the ruins of a feudal serfdom and successfully achieved the historical leap forward to socialism .  At the time of the peaceful liberation , the central authorities decided to temporarily retain Tibet 's old social system .  
Lenin said : " Only by being armed with all human knowledge can one become a communist . "  Only the new type of military personnel armed with all human knowledge , especially modern high-science and - technology knowledge , can accomplish our military 's historical mission of prevailing on the battlefield and remaining unchanged in nature .  
Both ordinary people and politicians have joined their ranks .  As far as the forms and nature of their activities are concerned , the post-war Japanese rightwing forces are quite similar to the pre-war ones .  They conduct terrorist activities , plot military coup d'etat , suppress progressive forces , strangle the freedom of speech , spare no effort to deny the history of invading China , adhere to the historical point of view of a kingdom , and advocate nationalism .  
Reviewing the spirit of struggle of our party in the Jinggangshan period along with the valuable historical experiences and excellent revolutionary traditions formed in the struggle has strong significance for the current strengthening of party building and the party 's close link with the masses .  
For example , they were related to such issues as reforming the housing system , reforming tertiary education , developing cultural industry , rebuilding old and dilapidated houses and buildings , and protecting historical cultural relics and legacies .  At the same time , the municipal party committee and government also set up a briefing system and arrange high-level and small-scope heart-to-heart talks .  
When looking at it from the point of view of the historical development of various " religious sects " , new and developing religious sects become discontented with the rigidity of the organizational system and break off from the mother religion .  Their leaders put forward the enlightenment of a special divinity and call on the minority of the followers .  This early developmental stage is inevitably looked upon by the mainstream as " heretical " .  
We should closely associate with the domestic and international situation , military construction and the ideological reality of every individual person .  We should inspect ourselves in accordance with the requirements of the " three represents " , profoundly consider and effectively understand the essence and internal relations of the " three represents " .  We must thoroughly understand the historical background and the era-oriented significance of the " three represents " .  
Under new historical conditions and due to the complicated and multi-faceted duties of our various military units in future anti-aggression war , we must abandon the traditional concept of " resisting and attacking enemies face-to-face " in our research and thoroughly study strong opponents who are capable of fighting a high-tech war .  
As noted in " The Decision on the Party 's Few Historical Issues Since the Founding of New China " , " Generally speaking , having relatively successfully conducted such a complex , difficult and profound social revolution in such a large country with hundreds of millions of people and having accelerated the development of the national economy including agriculture and industry is really a great historical victory " .  
The development and change of the post-Cold War international security situation shows that apart from cooperative security mechanism , the other mechanisms have not played or will also impossibly play , in the real terms , the role as patron saint in regional security , because the security based on those mechanisms is built on the basis of the others ' insecurity and is the refurbished version of the historical old security mechanism with hegemonist coloration .  
It is necessary to pay great attention to the management of scenic spots .  Houses should not be built at random in the vicinity of scenic spots .  Much less should cultural sites of historical interest be damaged or destroyed to build vulgar public places of entertainment .  
This means that the " Shanghai Five " mechanism will undergo a historical change from being a meeting mechanism to being a regional multilateral cooperation mechanism .  With the " Shanghai Five " mechanism substantiated and enhanced , it will play a greater role in and have a greater effect on speeding up the world 's multi-polarization process and building a just and reasonable international political and economic order .  
He spoke highly of the important role of the corps in production , construction , consolidating frontier defense , maintaining stability , and promoting ethnic solidarity , and encouraged its members to keep firmly in mind the heavy tasks entrusted them by the party and the people , further increase their sense of the historical mission and political responsibility of defending the border area and doing farm work there , and give full play to their role of a mainstay in promoting Xinjiang 's economic and social development and maintaining Xinjiang 's stability .  
In line with the work arrangements of the Central Military Commission and the PLA General Political Department , all major units of the PLA have engaged in theoretical studies ; carried out discussions and exchanged experiences ; and have enhanced their sense of responsibility and sense of mission in running well the education activity in close connection with the historical experiences that our party has gained in carrying out its struggle in unity over the past 80 years , and with the complex developments in the present situation of struggle both inside and outside the country .  
Particular efforts should be devoted to meticulously studying Chairman Jiang 's expositions on how we should understand the historical progress of development of socialist society , how we should understand historical progress of the development of capitalist society , how we should understand the influence on people 's thinking exerted by our practice of socialist reform and how we should understand the impact of the current international environment and international political struggles .  These expositions should be regarded as the guiding principle and fundamental basis for observing and understanding the international and domestic situation .  
and it played an important role in consolidating people 's democratic dictatorship , and in pushing forward the historical process of socialist revolution and construction in China .  With the arrival of the new historical period , the China Democratic League has showed its firm support for the line , principles , and policies that the CPC has adopted ever since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee ; conscientiously performed its role as a party participating in government and political affairs ;  
At the moment of commemorating the 80th anniversary of the party 's founding , we should seriously sum up the historical achievements of the united front and more profoundly understand its development regularity and historic mission .  This is of great significance for further consolidating and developing the most extensive patriotic united front and make it better serve the fulfillment of the three major tasks of the party and the state in the new century .  
He pointed out that the fundamental reason why the CPC has been able during its 80-year career to unite and lead the people of all nationalities throughout the country to win victory after victory and overcome one danger and obstacle after another is that we have consistently integrated the basic principles of Marxism with China 's specific reality , and have continually explored and upheld the correct road for advance suited to China 's realities in every historical period of revolution , construction , and reform .  
Keeping in mind the historical lesson learned from being overanxious to move toward communism , as well as the historical setback in the last decade of the previous century in the form of the disintegration of the Soviet Union , which was the first socialist country , CPC members are prepared to struggle in a down-to-earth manner for at least another 50 years for socialism in the initial stage and to struggle for 100 years or several hundred years for a relatively advanced or a more advanced stage of socialism .  
The exhibition is vivid teaching material for party history .  It is of great , realistic significance for us to run the government and educate people in line with history , accurately understand and grasp the law governing the development of human society , and inherit and carry forward the party 's fine traditions and work styles under new historical conditions .  
I hope the masses of science and technology workers will stay on the cutting edge of the new era , closely integrating personal ambitions with the nation 's future and fate ; undertake the historical responsibility of promoting science and technology advancements and innovations ; and continuously contribute to developing China into a prosperous , democratic , and civilized modern socialist country .  
The vast working masses should be guided to more clearly understand their own historical responsibility .  Such a sense of mission should be turned into a strong driving force to play a role as the main force to continuously enhance their own quality and make contributions to the building of a rich and powerful socialist modern country with a high degree of democracy and civilization as Comrade Jiang Zemin hoped .  
Under the leadership of the CPC , the vast mass of scientific and technological workers are united and mobilized to work hard for the development of science and technology in our country and for the realization of the grand objective of socialist modernization in our country .  This is the historical mission of the China Association of Science and Technology .  
At a deeper level , due to the influence and restraints of the " Leftist " thinking over a long time , many people still could not correctly distinguished Mao Zedong 's great historical merits and his mistakes in the late years , and could not shake off the influence of the guiding theory for the " Cultural Revolution , " namely , the " theory on continuing revolution under the proletarian dictatorship . "  
To achieve their evil purpose of splitting the motherland , Taiwan splittist forces headed by Lee Teng-hui [ Li Denghui ] politically carried out , in a flagrant way , splittist activities to create " two China 's " or " one China , one Taiwan " and culturally attempted to cut off the historical and cultural ties between Taiwan and the mainland of the motherland to confuse the Taiwan society 's thinking .  
Liu Yunshan said : In various historical periods in which the CPC leads revolution , construction and reform , its propaganda and ideological work plays a very important role in disseminating the scientific truth , promoting the integration of Marxism with the practical reality in China , uniting with , mobilizing and rallying the masses , fulfilling historical tasks in various periods , advocating advanced moral practice and scientific and civilized way of life , and improving the ideological , moral , scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation .  
The fine tradition of the Chinese nation and our revolutionary tradition have been carried forward under the new historical conditions .  Patriotism , collectivism , socialist concepts and socialist moral practice have become the essential aspect of our people 's mental world .  This conforms to the moral standardization of the development of our socialist economy and the common pursuit of all members of our society .  
Marxism-Leninism and its creative development in China have fundamentally enhanced the spirit of the Chinese nation , greatly strengthened the historical initiative of the Chinese communists and the Chinese people to push forward China 's social development and make the great cause of ours to constantly forge ahead toward the lofty objectives along with the steps of the times .  
Over the past 80 years , the people of all ethnic groups , the democratic parties , and progressive figures in all circles in our country always share weal and woe and fight side by side together with our party for our nation 's independence , prosperity , and bright future .  In the historical process of revolution , construction , and reform , they demonstrate a strong patriotic spirit and an indomitable fighting spirit .  
While efforts are made in history researches , attention should also be paid to propaganda , to the collection and sorting-out of raw historical materials , and to theoretical generation and analysis so that the party history work will be raised to a new level .  Second , adhere to the principle of seeking truth from facts , adhere to the analytical method of dialectical materialism and historical materialism .  Everything should be based on historical facts , and truth should be sought on the basis of facts .  
Basing ourselves on the long period of socialist construction , we have practiced new policies of reform and opening to the outside world and formulated the basic theory , line and program of our party in the initial stage of socialism after summing up both the internal and external historical experience and through hard exploration .  
The key to upholding Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in the new historical period lies in persistent use of Deng Xiaoping Theory to observe the present-day world and contemporary China , incessantly sum up practical experience and generalize it in the new theoretical light and open up new ways forward .  
Jiang Zemin stressed that the 80 years of the CPC are 80 years of constant pursuit for truth and pioneering and creation by integrating Marxism-Leninism with China 's practice ; they are 80 years of ceaseless and unremitting hard struggle for the liberation of the nation , the prosperity of the country and the happiness of the people ; and they are 80 years of withstanding endless tests and growing steadily in strength in the course of accomplishing the historical missions .  
If we dogmatically cling to some individual theses and specific programs of action formulated for a special situation by authors of Marxist classics in the specific historical conditions despite the changes in historical conditions and present realities , then we will have difficulty in forging ahead smoothly and we may even make mistakes because our thinking is divorced from reality .  
do a good job of the logistic work in the preparations for military struggle and of logistic reform and innovation with high demands and the spirit of the speech as the base , by centering on the party 's objective of endeavor and historical mission in the new century , and in line with the requirements set by the party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission , and realize adequate logistic support in real terms ;  
Participating comrades maintained : The important speech of General Secretary Jiang Zemin has comprehensively reviewed and summed up the glorious course of the Communist Party of China over the last 80 years , highly summarized the precious experience the party attained in its struggling course , set the objectives of endeavor and historical missions in the new century , and fully embodied and represented the fundamental interests and historical demands of the people throughout China .  
Over the 80 years under the correct leadership of the three generations of leading collectives headed by Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping and Jiang Zemin , the CPC has grown from small to large and from weak to strong .  It led the Chinese people to advance wave upon wave , wage tenacious struggles , found the new China , establish the socialist system , explore ways to building socialism with Chinese characteristics , and write a magnificent chapter in the historical development of the Chinese nation .  
given a concentrated expression to the latest achievements in theoretical innovation that have been attained by the party 's leading collective of the third generation ; and is therefore an enrichment and development of the Marxist theory on political parties .  The important thinking of " three represents " has pointed out the direction for our efforts to push forward the great project of strengthening party building under the present new historical conditions and to subsequently attain constant new victories in the undertaking of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
The " Speech " has integrated theory with practice , and the ideal with reality ; and has expounded the dialectical relations between the maximum program and the minimum program of the party .  While unfolding before us the bright future of a communist society , he has also stressed that the realization of communism is a very long historical process of struggle , and has urged the whole party to devote continued efforts to a successful fulfillment of both the basic program and the historical tasks of the party at the present stage .  
They said : In his speech , Jiang Zemin made a new theoretical summary of the party 's nature , fundamental aim , guiding principle , historical mission , and progressiveness ; and clearly set forth demands in carrying through the party 's ideological line , organizational line , and work line , and in carrying forward the party 's good traditions and work style .  
Hu Angang believes that , in a situation in which the rapid deceleration of the US economy is leading to a slowdown of the global economy , it is necessary to have an overall grasp and understanding of China 's present economic situation from the angle of historical development and a relative international perspective .  
requires that the entire party membership think of danger in times of peace and keep a stronger sense of crisis , guard against arrogance and rashness , continue to work hard for implementing the party 's basic line and fulfilling the party 's historical tasks .  Jiang Zemin 's speech shows a strategic foresight , provides profound ideas , gives theoretical guidance to many issues , and is another important programmatic document of our party to carry forward its cause into the future .  
Through study and discussion , all people attending the meeting deeply realized that the important thinking on " three represents " set forth by Comrade Jiang Zemin is a creative application of the basic theory of historical materialism , which is practiced in contemporary China . It greatly enrich people 's understanding of the party 's character , basic principle , and task .  
The participants held that the important thinking of " three represents " has elaborated in a concentrated manner on the fundamental demands of maintaining the advanced nature of the CPC in the 21st century , and fundamentally answered the questions of " what kind of party we should build and how to build it " under the new historical conditions , and clearly defined the general orientation for strengthening and improving the party .  
Zhang Wannian said that General Secretary Jiang 's important speech stands at a historical , epochal , and strategic high plane , and uses a proletarian politician 's grand boldness of vision and daring combined with superior judgment - - as well as using the profound insight and enormous theoretical courage of a brilliant Marxist - - to carry out a systematic , scientific , and incisive exposition toward a series of significant questions regarding the future prospects and fate of the party and the nation .  
As the so-called " corrections " avoid the essential and concrete , steer clear of the important and dwell on the trivial , and still retain erroneous statements and absurd historical views in the original textbook , China can not accept them .  
The SEF-vs-ARATS mechanism was originally a temporary expedient designed to play the role of a " white glove " under the circumstances in those years when there was no official contact between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits , and was therefore a measure based on a specific objective historical background and serious political considerations .  
While celebrating the 80th anniversary of CPC founding and marching toward the future , we must , as is required by the three represents , ? closely center round the basic issue of what kind of party to build and how under the new historical conditions and closely grasp the two major historic subjects of enhancing the party abilities of administration and art of leadership and resisting corruption , guarding against degeneration and warding off risks , and push party building to a new stage .  
In the study of the speech , efforts should be focused on studying and understanding the party 's basic experience , the scientific connotations of the important thinking on " three represents , " the requirement for strengthening and improving party building , and party 's historical tasks and fighting targets in the new century .  
At the mass meeting celebrating the 80th anniversary of the founding of the CPC ( Communist Party of China ) , Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out profoundly that , faced with profound changes in the situation at home and abroad , if our Party is to follow the trend of world progress closely , uniting and leading the various peoples nationwide in seizing the opportunities , meeting the challenges , and successfully accomplishing the three great historical tasks , we must be unwavering in carrying out the demands of the " three represents . "  
When fathers of Marxism hold such an open and dynamic attitude towards their classical works , why do we have to be dogmatic , worship books and be restrained to some expositions and specific practical programs they proposed in specific historical conditions and concrete situations ?  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech delivered at the celebration of the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China points out the Party 's historical task and objective in the new century and provides a powerful ideological weapon and enormous spiritual driving force that encourages the majority of Party members to live through all kinds of tests and forever maintain the advanced nature of Party members .  
Grasping the historical trend and keeping in step with the times , the CPC , armed with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , has done everything for the people , relied on them , kept blazing new paths for revolution , construction , and reform , continuously united the tremendous strength of the people of various nationalities who are advancing bravely , and continued to win their deep love and respect .  In the revolutionary war years , party members shed their blood and laid down their lives ;  
Japan would have difficulty achieving a genuine sentimental reconciliation with its Asian neighbors , and Japan 's international image also would constantly be damaged if it should be unable to lay down this heavy burden on its own by correctly approaching history and properly handling historical issues .  
Chen Yusu said : In May 2000 and January 2001 , General Secretary Kim Jong-il twice visited China at the important historical moments at the turn of the century , and held cordial meetings and important talks with General Secretary Jiang Zemin . This further increased the mutual understanding , trust , friendship , and cooperation between the two parties and the two countries , won warm support from the Chinese and Korean peoples , and also produced a positive impact on the international situation .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's 1 July speech adheres to the unity of the historical and current views , the unity of moving forward and developing Marxism and the unity of the theory and reality .  This important speech comprehensively , systematically and profoundly reveals the rich content , the scientific spirit and the mutual relationship among the " three represents " and explicitly points out the guiding and theoretical significance of the " three represents " on Party-building and the political , economic and cultural development of our country .  
In the new century , we shall be facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges .  The CPC , which shoulders the three major historical tasks , has once again set forth hopes and requirements for the younger generation .  They are required to " love the motherland , love the people , cherish lofty aspirations and broad vision , give full play to their wisdom and resourcefulness and realize their life values on the broad stage of reform , opening up , and modernization , and score deeds worthy to the times and the people . "  
To improve the party 's leadership and party building , we must first proceed from these two major transformations to earnestly study theoretical and practical issues facing party building under the new historical conditions and study the laws governing the rule of the country by the Communist Party , socialist construction , and the development of human society that underlie these issues so as to better advance party building .  
You have been fulfilling the general demand of Chairman Jiang 's " five phrases " , meeting high standards , and completely improving the quality of the troops bearing in mind the historical mission of " fighting to win " and " maintaining the true qualities , " thus outstandingly accomplishing all tasks bestowed on you by the people , forging the veteran Tibetan spirit of " being particularly able to bear hardship , to fight , to endure , to remain united , and to dedicate yourselves , " and producing large numbers of advanced role models .  
They point out that the establishment of the strategic partnership marked by equality and trust was a correct historical choice , and it has decisive significance for strengthening cooperation between the People 's Republic of China and the Russian Federation in all areas , for consolidating friendship between the Chinese and Russian peoples , and for building a just and rational international new order .  
This term , the most conscientious and advanced elements , applies to that portion of people who are proficient in scientific Marxist theory , who understand the law of social development , who define their historical mission , and who represent the basic interests of the overwhelming majority of the people .  
The historical mission for the current period put forth by our Party is , through reform and opening-up , to further liberate and develop the productive forces , promote national economic , political and cultural development in an all-around way , continuously improve people 's material and cultural standards of living , strive to build China into a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , modernized socialist country , and strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people .  
After Comrade Jiang Zemin examined the current domestic and foreign situations and the mission of our Party , and after he analyzed how to persist in keeping the Party 's nature one as the vanguard of the working class in the new historical conditions so as to safeguard our Party 's advanced nature , he put forward this extremely profound explanation , making clear the orientation of Party construction in the new period .  
This great historical process is a necessity in the social and historical development of Tibet , is a common aspiration of the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet , and is also a brilliant example as how the CPC has applied the basic principles of Marxism for the resolution of China 's national issues .  
In the first 10 years plus since the implementation of reform and opening up , the gap between the level of Tibet 's economic and cultural development with the inland and the inland as well as the coastal developed areas in the east showed a trend of further widening instead of shrinking because Tibet was restricted by natural conditions and because of historical reasons .  
Diligent and wise , Tibet 's people of all nationalities have , in the course of long historical development , made outstanding contributions in creating a splendid culture of the Chinese nation and founding our unified , multinational country .  In the past half century in particular , they have written a magnificent chapter of Tibet 's development and progress , adding a new splendor to the community of the socialist motherland .  
In the long historical development , the hardworking and intelligent people of all ethnic groups in Tibet have made remarkable contributions to creating the shinning cultures of the Chinese nation and to building our unified multinational country .  The brilliant chapter of Tibet 's development and progress in the past 50 years that you have written has added new glory to the big family of our socialist motherland .  
Whether from the historical , cultural , or geographical angles , or from the political and economic reality angle , Taiwan 's future lies with the mother mainland , and its security is determined by the close ties of people on both sides of the strait and by ultimate peaceful reunification .  
China and Malta are situated far from each other , and they are different in terms of national situation , size , population , and historical background .  However , their relations over the nearly 30 years after they established diplomatic ties can be held up as an example of equal treatment , mutual respect , and peaceful coexistence between a big country and a small nation .  
Wen Jiabao pointed out that during the " Ninth Five-Year Plan , " through comprehensive agricultural development , we improved agricultural production conditions , protected and improved the ecological environment , raised comprehensive agricultural production capabilities and efficiency , and increased agricultural citizen income .  We thus made important contributions to the historical transformation from the long-term deficiency in chief agricultural products to an overall balance and years of surplus .  In our practice we also created many effective experiences .  
In the new historical conditions , society will be diversified and the situation will become more complex .  In light of this , only with a clear theoretical understanding can one take a firm political stance , take initiatives , and hold loftier spiritual ideals .  
We have a system to establish political commissioners and political institutions .  We also have a system to base Party branches on the military units at the company level .  The availability of and the adherence to these systems enables our military to ensure the military remains under the Party 's firm control despite the dynamic historical conditions and constant changes in members of the military .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important speech , he pointed out , persisted in being guided by Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , applied the party 's ideological line of emancipating the minds and seeking truth from facts , systematically and comprehensively enunciated the scientific content of the " three represents " principle , provided profound answers to major issues to be resolved in order to enhance and improve party building under new historical conditions , and further clarified the party 's historical tasks and objectives of striving in the new century .  
It is understood that in the view of the top Chinese leadership , the core of the " three represents " thinking ( the CPC represents the developing needs of China 's advanced social productive forces , the forward direction of advanced Chinese culture , and the fundamental interests of the broadest masses of the Chinese people ) lies in : Demanding the CPC continue preserving its advanced nature , winning popular support , and maintaining and consolidating its position as a ruling party under the new historical conditions .  
As commanding organs for the entire army , the four general departments put forward : We must attain a high standard in putting the " three represents " into practice and - - with a strong sense of responsibility and the sense of urgency in a race against time - - break new ground , make advances , and make innovations with keen determination to comprehensively advance the building of a more revolutionary , modern , and regularized army and struggle hard for accomplishing the historical mission entrusted to our army by the party and the people .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important " 1 July " speech comprehensively , systematically , and incisively revealed the scientific implications of the " three represents " thinking .  On the basis of comprehensively summarizing the historical experience in party building over the last 80 years , he profoundly analyzed the social , economic , and political changes which have taken place since the introduction of the reform and opening-up program .  He also briefly defined the party 's nature , aim , and missions anew , showing us clearly the way forward .  
In the new century , China and Japan should , on the basis of the spirit of " taking a warning from history and looking forward to the future " and the principle determined in the Sino-Japanese Joint Statement , Sino-Japanese Treaty of Peace and Friendship , and Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration , continue to hold the overall bilateral relationship from strategic and historical heights , eliminate disturbances , and overcome obstacles ; and to work hard to open up a new aspect of good neighborliness , friendship , and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Japan .  
At the exhibition , more than 2,000 valuable pictures and 500 cultural relics , displayed in chronological sequence of historical development , vividly depicted the brilliant achievements scored by the people of all nationalities throughout the country in carrying out revolution , reform , construction , and reform under the leadership of the party 's three generations of central collective leadership with Comrades Mao Zedong , Deng Xiaoping , and Jiang Zemin as the core .  
Recently , at an interview by a Hong Kong reporters ' delegation , Raidi , executive deputy secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Regional CPC Committee and chairman of the Standing Committee of the autonomous regional people 's congress said : After the passing of the 14th Dalai Lama , we will find the reincarnated child , according to historical conventions and religious rituals that were formed hundreds of years ago .  
Raidi said : Successive Dalai Lamas first searched for a few candidates for a relevant reincarnated child , according to historical conventions and religious rituals , before selecting one of them according to the ceremony of drawing lots from a golden urn and confirming the child after the approval of the central government .  Any act that runs counter to historical conventions and religious rituals would be regarded as invalid .  
Proceeding from the profound changes in the domestic and international situation faced by our party and from major historical tasks shouldered by our party , the speech systematically and penetratingly expounded the scientific connotation and the spiritual essence of the important idea of " three represents . "  
In carrying out political structural reform , we must take into full account China 's historical background , level of economic development , and cultural and educational standards , and must also help to preserve national unity , ethnic solidarity , and social stability .  
In carrying out political structural reform , we must take into full account China 's historical background , level of economic development , and cultural and educational standards , and must also help to preserve national unity , ethnic solidarity , and social stability .  
Any historical assessment of Japan 's war of aggression has been subjected to rigorous historical examination by every successive postwar Japanese government , but their annual statements marking the " Day the War Ended " ( they dare not call it the " Day of Surrender " ) have all been disappointing .  Disregarding strong domestic and foreign opposition , Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi insisted on paying his respects at Yasukuni Shrine , where a large group of war criminals is enshrined .  
However , due to historical and practical reasons , some backward cultures , and even decadent cultures that corrode people 's mind and endanger the cause of socialism , have emerged in society .  These cultures corrupt social values , weaken the will of people , poison young people 's mind , have caused great harm to society , and have aroused the strong resentment of the masses of people .  We must make great efforts to rectify this situation .  
The important thinking on " three represents , " the party-building theory for a communist party and especially a communist party in a ruling position , and the thesis on combining the long-term struggle objective of the communist party with the contemporary historical tasks are all important theoretical subjects related to all branches of culture and social sciences .  The theoretical research work of the academy must deal with every issue and every link through in-depth study and understanding .  
Because Japanese society widely considers that neighboring countries all have requests and think that Japanese economic aid and science and technology are critical to many developing Asian nations , therefore even if people have been " offended " on the historical issue , this is of no significance and will not hinder Japan from becoming an " international country , " to the point of being a permanent member of the UN Security Council .  
The important thinking of ' three represents ' has creatively enriched and developed Marxism , reflected in a concentrated way the whole view and new historical achievements of our party in upholding and developing Marxism over the last 80 years , and fully shown that the Communist Party of China has proved itself to be a Marxist political party which is firm and sober in theory , highly mature in politics , and composed and self-confident in practice . "  
It is of typical significance , unique value , and rich historical connotation in correctly approaching the historical missions of Marxism to scientifically analyze our party 's strenuous explorations over the last 80 years and the profound scientific connotations of the important thinking of " three represents . "  
Second , the party 's basic theory , basic line , and basic program as well as numerous other principles and policies at the initial stage of socialism are extremely invaluable spiritual wealth attainted by the party after scientifically having summed up domestic and international historical experience , positive and negative .  
He said : By adopting a foreign policy of going our own way , the Bush Administration will disrupt international security , hurt our economic and environmental protection interests , and stop a historical chance for us to agree with China and Russia on limiting weapons and reducing nuclear weapons .  " These examples demonstrate that a country 's unilateral actions can not possibly form a lasting strategic framework that has the submission of all other countries . "  
General Secretary Jiang 's July 1 speech , he said , is important because it provides our party with a powerful ideological weapon for understanding , strengthening , and improving itself under new historical conditions and provides a strong spiritual force for our great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  Studying the speech is not only an important political task for the entire military now , but also a long-term strategic task .  
Today , Chinese Ambassador to Japan Wu Dawei said here that in the past few months of this year , with the occurrence of such events as the historical issue , Lee Teng-hui 's visit to Japan , and the Japanese prime minister 's action of paying homage at Yasukuni Shrine , Sino-Japanese relations have been bogged down in the most difficult condition over the past 30 years since the normalization of diplomatic relations .  The Japanese side should create favorable conditions for getting Sino-Japanese relations out of this predicament by resolving the current existing problems .  
as published ] " and that he himself was " a citizen of a fallen state " shortly after escaping to Taiwan . Now the Taiwan authorities ' so-called " Republic of China " is in fact nothing but a historical issue left from the civil war between the Kuomintang [ KMT ] and CPC . It is illegitimate according to either domestic or international law and it fundamentally has no right to represent China .  
Owing to the historical , geographical , natural conditions , and other reasons , it has generally formed into three regions , i.e . , eastern , central , and western regions in terms of economic development level , of which the eastern region is the highest , the western region is the lowest , and the central region is in between .  
He emphasized the necessity of giving prominence to key points , linking with the reality of the armed forces , closely centering around the two historical themes of " being able to win " and " not changing color " facing the PLA , thinking deeply about how to keep abreast of the new trends in the world 's military development and how to bring about development in big strides in the modernization of the armed forces , and putting forward suggestions and proposals that show real knowledge and deep insight .  
It is of major practical significance and far-reaching historical significance .  Through two decades of reforms and opening up , China 's comprehensive national strength has notably increased and a socialist market economic system has been preliminarily established .  Thus , conditions are ripe for accelerating the development of China 's western regions .  
Due to the historical link of nationalities , religion , cultural and geographical position and because of the resurgence of Turkism and Islamism in central and western Asia , those separatists who escaped from Xinjiang years ago are engaged in separatist activities in countries in central Asia . Xinjiang 's separatists have also used Turkey as their base of operation .  
The historical contribution of the Taiwan Strait area and the Western Pacific coastal area in the 21st century , and whether it will create wealth or engender more conflict , will be decided based on whether the leaders of Taiwan , poised at a crossroads , can accurately judge the trends of the times , distinguishing true historical opportunities from false , in order to successfully negotiate the difficult situation in which they find themselves .  
He said : The one China principle is an inevitable conclusion of China 's historical development over 5,000 years , is the objective condition shaped in the history of cross-strait relations , is the basic norm respected and observed by the international community and international laws , and is a fact commonly accepted by the 1.3 billion Chinese people ( including most Taiwan compatriots ) and tens of millions of overseas Chinese compatriots .

This is an important development of the party building theory made by the third generation of leading collective with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core .  It is also a practical issue that must be studied and resolved in order to uphold , strengthen , and improve party leadership under the new historical conditions .  The Shanghai municipal party committee must continue to play well the role of the core of leadership , commanding the whole situation and coordinating the efforts of all quarters .  
However , I believe that Ch'en Shui-bian 's inaugural speech addressed only minor issues and not the major one and that it avoided the important issue while dwelling on the trivial , if we judge the speech against the backdrop that Taiwan is part of the Chinese territory , that people of Chinese descent at home and abroad demanded that he make known his position on the issue of one China , and that he shoulders the historical mission of maintaining peace and stability across the strait .  
" We are of the opinion that the two sides can create a favorable condition for reaching an ultimate reasonable solution to the issue , so long as they respect historical facts and make friendly consultations based on the principle of mutual understanding and mutual accommodation . "  
Nevertheless , with a guilty conscience , he did not dare to use expressions like " two countries " but carefully chose a neutral expression such as " the two sides of the Taiwan Straits . " He said that " the same historical experiences should have laid a solid foundation for the people living on the two sides of the Taiwan Straits to gain mutual understanding and commonly seek freedom , democracy , human rights , . .  
Second , our country 's economic restructuring has entered a crucial stage , and industries are in a historical stage of large-scale readjustment .  If we do not set up and improve the social security system , it will be impossible to realize the fundamental reform of state-owned enterprises , there will be no way to readjust the industrial structure , and it will be difficult to maintain social stability .  
The separatist forces have disregarded the historical trend of China 's reunification , and pleaded with foreign forces in a vain attempt to bring about " Taiwan independence . "  This is completely a futile effort out of their wishful thinking .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin praised highly the visit of General Secretary Kim Jong-Il at the important historical moment of the turn of the century .  He maintained that the current visit is of important significance to further improvement of mutual understanding , trust , friendship , and cooperation between the two parties and two countries , and to the promotion of development of Sino-DPRK friendly relations [ zhong chao you hao guan xi ] oriented toward the new century .  
However , Annette Lu , a person who holds a master 's degree in law , has disregarded the historical facts and legal documents at the current moment when cross-strait relations are facing a severe test .  She has confounded right with wrong , and replayed in an unscrupulous manner the " old tune " of " Taiwan independence . "  
At this important historical juncture of the turn of the century , how to promote China 's scientific and technological progress and innovation , bring into play the important role of the number one productive forces of science and technology , continually provide a strong impetus for China 's economic and social development , and enable China to see even greater development in the acute international competition of the future are the significant tasks to which we must give careful consideration .  
This is the most basic requirement of dialectical materialism and historical materialism , as well as the scientific methodology of Marxism . Marx , Engels , Lenin , and Comrades Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping were all adept at putting forward new ideology and theories based on actual development changes .  
Deng Xiaoping first readjusted the past practice of using the social system and ideology as a line of demarcation and advocated proceeding from the national strategic interests in handling state-to-state relations , transcending the similarities and differences in social systems and ideology , giving no thought to historical resentment , refraining from engaging in ideological disputes , and developing relations with all countries in accordance with the norms of international relations .  
The " three represents " show that on the three questions that determine our party 's historical status and role , our party 's program , line , principles , and policies have conformed to the laws of social development and adapted to the tide of the advance of the times .  It is precisely for this reason that our party has occupied its rightful position in history , has continually promoted the onward advanced of Chinese society , and has been extensively supported and esteemed by the people of all nationalities throughout China .  
Countries differ in many ways , in their social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural heritage , economic development , standard of living , religious beliefs , and values .  Therefore , it is not possible to expect all countries to develop after a single model or system .  
The North and the South have markedly enhanced their mutual trust .  When problems occurred , Kim Chong-il and Kim T'ae-chung exercised restraint and took the initiative to express their goodwill toward each other .  Their unremitting efforts and correct decisions have eventually been crowned with the historical summit .  
The changes in the political situation in the peninsula and the process of peaceful reunification are linked with its own unique historical conditions .  This issue has also given us some enlightenment .  Personnel contacts and economic , trade exchanges can enhance understanding and mutual trust .  
Li Peng said : China similarly respects the general principle of the international community on human rights .  However , we feel that as countries have different social systems , economic conditions , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , and religious beliefs , they do not share an identical understanding of human rights .  This is very natural .  
T'ao Mu-lien , an expert in East Asia studies in the University of South California , has indicated : The fact that the " two Koreas " have held talks and have signed a historical declaration is of a major political and historic significance to pushing the Korean Peninsula towards the direction of peaceful reunification .  
He said , joining the WTO will usher in a new historical phase for China 's reform and open up .  Under the multilateral , stable , unconditional most-favored-nation principle extended by the WTO to its members , China can enter into international trade and economic cooperation and create the favorable international environment for the development of its national economic and foreign economic and trade relations and promote the country 's national economic development .  
When the " 4 June " incident took place on the mother mainland in 1989 , the statements made by the then new Taiwan leader involved the phrases with Chinese historical complex , such as the " free Republic of China " " supported its patriotic compatriots , " who should " closely unite as one " to " realize democratic reunification . "  One-China that Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo followed during their rule of Taiwan for decades can " carefully be observed " in their statements .  
Since people 's spiritual and cultural demands are restricted by historical , social , or personal factors on the one hand , and is plastic in nature on the other .  Therefore , guiding people 's spiritual and cultural life is both necessary and indispensable .  
Unremitting efforts should be made to build leading bodies of courts at all levels into a strong and powerful core of leadership that meets the " three represents " demand and that is able to shoulder the trans-century , historical , and heavy tasks so as to ensure that the judicial authority of the state is firmly grasped in the hands of the judges who are loyal to the party , the people , the Constitution , and the laws and in an effort to obviously improve the overall quality and judicial expertise of the courts .  
He emphatically pointed out : His thesis that our party should " always be a requirement in the development of advanced productive force in China - - - - a faithful representative of the fundamental interest of the greatest majority of the Chinese people " means that such a historic mission should be carried out as a dynamic historical process .  
This is a scientific appraisal made in a historical perspective and based on reality and great foresight .  It will largely encourage the business circles and all other social sectors in Hong Kong to make concerted efforts with collective wisdom , jointly support the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( SAR ) government headed by Tung Chee-hwa in its administration by law , thus create a brighter future for Hong Kong .  
In the new historical period , Chairman Jiang , based on the developmental changes in the domestic and foreign situation , summarized the new experience in our army 's modernization development , creatively putting forward the scientific concept of " ideological and political development " , stressing that we must put ideological and political development in the premier position among all the army 's development projects , and he gave a series of important instructions in regard to strengthening military ideological and political development under the new situation .  
In his speech , Jiang Zemin put forward and expounded on how to understand the historical process of the development of socialism and capitalism , the impact of the practice of China 's socialist reform on people 's thinking , the influence of the contemporary international environment and international political struggle , and other major issues that have a direct bearing on the mental state of cadres and the masses .  He urged all party comrades to jointly conduct in-depth study in an effort to acquire scientific knowledge in the ideological and political sphere .  
the effective protection and the active use of cultural relics and historical records ; the respect and protection that has been showed and extended to customs and folkways as well as to the freedom of religious belief ; an all-round inheritance and development of culture and arts ; a comprehensive engagement in Tibetan studies ; and by the rejuvenation of the Tibetan medicine .  All these have attested to the full that the Tibetan culture has undergone an unprecedented development , and this is a fact that allows of no doubt .  
It clarifies the historical tasks shouldered by the ideological and political work in the new century .  It profoundly expounds a series of major theoretical and practical issues , which are of fundamental and overall importance in nature .  
Under new historical conditions , the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and continuing to draw on fresh experiences , has put forward many new and important ideas and points of view , mapped out a series of interrelated moves , and creatively inherited and developed the theories of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping on party building .  
In the historical process of the new emerging out of the old , mankind 's advanced culture consciously represents the mainstream of the times , the orientation of social development , and the will of the people and is an active and dynamic spiritual force for guiding and promoting historical progress .  
This requires us to have an insight into the general international situation and a profound understanding of China 's conditions .  It requires us to put forward a correct political line and formulate feasible principles and policies based on a clearly defined historical mission .  
During her recent inspection tour of Guizhou , Wu Yi , alternate member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and state councilor , emphasized the necessity of seriously studying a series of important instructions given by General Secretary Jiang Zemin on developing the western region , firmly seizing the historical opportunity for developing the western region , further emancipating the mind , changing concepts , boldly using foreign and domestic funds , opening up wider , and promoting development .  
She hoped all cadres and people of Guizhou will further seek unity of thinking on reform and opening up , change concepts , increase understanding , maintain a good spirit , seize the historical opportunity for developing the western region , make progress on one 's own initiative , make unremitting efforts to improve oneself , and work hard in a down-to-earth manner .  
Nevertheless , at the same time , the Taiwan authorities have refused to make appropriate efforts to respond to the two proposals put forward by the mainland of the motherland on clearly promising not to practice the " state-to-state theory " and clearly promising to adhere to the common understanding reached between ARATS and SEF in 1992 that both sides may verbally express their respective views on " adhering to the principle of one China by both sides of the strait . "  They disregarded historical facts .  
In the formulation of urban and rural development plans , we must take into account the national economic and social development plan as well as the natural environment , resources , historical and present conditions and future development of various localities in drawing a comprehensive layout .  
As a kind of comprehensive planning , urban and rural planning must properly handle the relations between the part and the whole , the near term and the long tem , needs and possibilities , economic development and social development , urban and rural construction and environmental protection , modernization and protection of historical and cultural relics , and so on .  
A city is an organic body that is constantly developing and renewing itself .  Our task is to ensure the economic and social development of cities and raise the level of their modernization while protecting their historical and cultural legacies .  
The effective protection and rational utilization of scenic and historical resources are of great importance to the improvement of the ecological environment , the development of tourism , the promotion of ethnic culture , the stimulation of patriotic passion , and the enrichment of people 's cultural life .  
As the social systems , historical backgrounds , cultural traditions , economic levels , living quality , religious beliefs , senses of value , and so on of all countries in the world differ in thousands of ways and it is impossible to ask every country to indiscriminately copy one model and one system .  
General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important speech shows great foresight , has the overall situation in view , contains rich and profound ideas , possesses the distinct features of the times , and aims at very definite objectives , which is of momentous practical significance as well as far-reaching historical significance to intensifying and improving the party 's ideological and political work oriented to the new century .  We must study the gist of the speech and put it into practice in a conscientious manner .  
The party 's ideological and political work must be continually strengthened and improved in light of the continually changing reality in the new historical period , and can not be relaxed or weakened in the slightest .  
In the new historical period , departments taking part in the cooperation in science and technology for national defense have carried out reform at a deeper level , quickened development , readjusted their structure , laid a more solid foundation , improved quality , ensured supply , striven to raise their technological level and increase their ability to ensure supply , and ensured the comprehensive fulfillment of their tasks in the development of new products and in their cooperation in production .  
Third , the two countries shared common historical experiences .  China and Burma have constantly shown sympathy for and supported each other in their efforts for independence and liberation , safeguarding of national independence and sovereign and territorial integrity , and national construction .  Common national fates have closely linked the two countries together .  
Speaking of developing a tourism industry , Ismail Amat stated : Located along a vital communications line on the Silk Road , Xinjiang has peculiar and beautiful natural scenery , rich folk customs and habits , unique historical or cultural heritage , as well as infrastructure facilities , which are beginning to take shape , and thus has great potential for developing a tourism industry .  
Facts in history and international laws and norms all provide undeniable evidence to prove that Taiwan is China 's territory since ancient times .  Even though the two sides of the straits now are still in a temporary state of division due to historical reasons , this does not change the fundamental one-China fact .  This is also the written position maintained by the Taiwan authorities thus far .  
Particularly in the extraordinary 20th century , the unyielding and hard-working Asian people have written another grand epic of political awakening and economic takeoff through their unremitting efforts for prosperity .  They have thus strongly promoted the historical progress and social development .  
Recently , individuals in economic circles have pointed out that the major turnaround we are seeing in macroeconomic operations shows that the various macroeconomic regulatory measures - - primarily the aggressive fiscal policies - - implemented by China are having a significant positive effect , creating a golden historical opportunity for China 's economic development .  
In the new historical period , the Peasants ' and Workers ' Democratic Party firmly supports the line , principles , and policies adopted by the CPC since the 3d plenary session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , conscientiously performs its functions as a political party participating in the government , and does effective work for promoting national economic and cultural development , safeguarding the political situation of stability and unity , and promoting the great cause of the motherland 's peaceful reunification .  
In the historical conditions in which the world is at a big turning point and in which tremendous changes are taking place in China , the key to fulfilling the grand , trans-century objectives set at the 15th CPC National Congress and advancing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in an all-round way lies in building a contingent of high-quality cadres who can meet the requirements of the " three represents . "  
He said , the MCPONP is an unprecedented historical meeting .  The fact that presiding officers of various national parliaments are getting together for this grand meeting is not only of an important symbolic meaning .  It also has a tremendous actual significance .  
Our party can certainly shoulder the historical heavy task of leading China 's socialist cause so long as we keenly grasp the demand for the development of China 's advanced social productive forces and the direction of China 's advanced culture and the fundamental interests and benefits of the overwhelming majority of people in China , do a good job in various work according the requirements of the " three represents , " and further improve the building of out party .  
This is extremely unwise .  The US and Chinese electoral systems can not be completely similar , because our historical traditions , economic and cultural development standards , educational level and social systems differ .  
In particular , since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee , the party central leading body with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core has set forth comprehensive and profound theses on cadre supervision around the two historical themes of enhancing the party 's leading and ruling capability and enhancing the party 's ability to resist corruption and degeneration and overcome risks , and has set forth explicit guidelines , basic principles , targets , and requirements for cadre supervision work in the new period .  
and have also played an important role in promoting a democratic and scientific policymaking process .  Facts prove that to conduct investigation and study on selected major questions of economic and social development in a planned way is a good form for the democratic parties , the Federation of Industry and Commerce and non-party personages to participate in the administration and discussion of state affairs and exercise democratic supervision ; and it is also a good way to do the united front work under the historical conditions .  
In line with Chairman Jiang 's important instructions , the all-military political work meeting has put forward the historical missions of ideological and political construction in the military in the new situation - - to provide powerful spiritual motivation for winning future high-tech wars , and to provide a reliable political guarantee for maintaining the nature , inherent qualities , and style of the people 's military .  
He said : In the contemporary era , new knowledge keeps emerging in vast multitude , science and technology are advancing with each passing day , and the social productive forces are considerably elevated , which have produced enormous impacts on the world 's political , economic , cultural , and social lives , so that human beings are confronted with new , tremendous historical changes and leaps .  
General Secretary Jiang 's important speech at the central ideological and political work meeting , from a higher starting point , with a broader vision , and in a deeper sense , has brought to light the profound historical background , complicated social environment , and many other formidable challenges facing ideological and political work , and has raised our understanding of the life-line position of ideological and political work to the new height .  
At present , China 's economic structural reform has entered a crucial stage of storming fortified positions , in which the state-owned enterprise ( SOE ) reform is gradually deepened , the industrial structure is in a period of large-scale adjustment , and reform , opening up , and modernization are faced with new historical missions , for which a stable social environment is especially necessary .  
Since in history imperialism used Catholicism and Protestantism to serve its national political interests , certain foreign missionaries relied on the unequal treaties to commit all kinds of outrages and caused over 1,500 large and small missionary cases [ jiao an ] , for which many Chinese lost their lives , and a number of Chinese Catholics also became innocent victims ; these historical wounds are still there in the hearts of the Chinese people and the Chinese Catholic Church .  
This book series has condensed the changes of the Chinese nation in a century .  It has especially displayed in a concentrated manner the historical facts about the earth-shaking struggle waged by numerous revolutionary martyrs under the leadership of the CPC for national independence , the liberation of the people , and the cause of socialist construction , and has vividly recorded the lofty revolutionary spirit of the Chinese communists of heroically fighting for the interests of the motherland and the people , fearing no sacrifice .  
The Chinese Communist Party has united and led the various ethnic groups of China and carried out an indomitable and extremely hard and bitter struggle , always passing on the torch .  They overturned the " three mountains " that oppressed the Chinese people and created a new historical era in which the Chinese are their own masters in independently constructing socialism .  
Wang Zhongyu pointed out that this time , the Chinese Olympic delegation has made historical breakthroughs , displayed fully to the whole world the spiritual style and features of being united and forging ahead of the Chinese people , greatly encouraged the patriotic fervor of the people of all ethnic groups across the country , increased the national cohesive force of Chinese at home and abroad , and further enhanced the high prestige of the socialist motherland .  
Qian Qichen said : Shanxi Province boasts very rich tourist resources .  In recent years , Shanxi has entered tourism into the list of the province 's superior industries , increased the work intensity of transforming the advantages in tourist resources into the industrial advantages , initially formed a few tourist zones with special characteristics , and taken firm control of the tourist infrastructure construction , environmental protection , ecological construction , historical relics protection , and the deep-level development of tourist serial products , with a view to repeatedly optimizing and upgrading tourism .  
Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is mutually beneficial .  Japan 's yen loans to China and its official development aid have played and will continue to play an important role in China 's reforms , opening up , and modernization ; the attitude of the Japanese Government on the historical problem is generally speaking continuing to make progress , and Japan is now taking a more responsible attitude in handling the problems of chemical weapons left behind in China .  
We should take Marxism , Mao Zedong Thought and Deng Xiaoping Theory as guidance , adhere to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts , and use the broad vision of historical materialism and dialectical materialism to observe the world , understand the overall situation , study new issues and sum up new experiences in order to continuously improve the party 's level of administration and improve its ability in controlling the overall situation of economic and social development .  
Under a new situation , we always insist on the forward direction of advanced Chinese culture and push the prosperous development of socialism 's culture and art to satisfy the growing need for peoples ' cultural spirit , and provide the insured thoughts , motives of spirit and intellectual support for economic development and improvement of the whole society , and build a nice social atmosphere and human cultural circumstance , above are honorable and difficult historical responsibilities of the cultural and art workers .  
An analysis of historical experiences and current realities of China and foreign countries throughout history will show that whether or not the nationality issue is handled well is of great importance to national unity , economic development , political stability , and social progress .  
The series has a clear-cut theme and rich contents .  It has historical depth , distinguishing features characterizing our times , and a clear objective .  It is effective teaching material for conducting political and quality professional education for cadres .  
Li Peng said that as the social system and development level of various countries are different and their historical and cultural background and concepts on value differ in a thousand ways , it is not at all surprising that they have divergent views on some problems .  The best way of solving the problems is to conduct exchanges and dialogues on the basis of friendliness , equality , mutual respect , and the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences .  
Under the new historical conditions , increasing mutual understanding and trust between the two peoples and expanding bilateral cooperation in various fields are of specially great importance to ensuring that relations between the two countries move forward in a steady and stable way and that friendship between the two peoples will continue from generation to generation .  
Wu Bangguo said : As a traditional industry , the coal industry has to shoulder a heavy historical burden .  In the current process , in which great changes have taken place in market supply and demand and the old economic system is being changed into the new , it is difficult for coal enterprises themselves to completely overcome difficulties they have encountered .  The government must make efforts to create an essential external environment and conditions in all aspects and give them specific support and assistance .  
China and Russia , two neighboring powers , share similar historical and cultural origins and have similar views on many major international issues , including the establishment of a just and reasonable international political and economic new order as well as the establishment of a multipolar world .  
He briefed the Russian guests on China 's Tenth Five-Year Plan , and stressed that China and Russia should pay attention to going with the historical trend of rapid scientific and technological development and make concrete efforts to intensify bilateral economic , scientific and technological exchanges and cooperation so as to lay a solid foundation for furthering bilateral friendly , mutually beneficial and cooperative relations . 
truthfully recorded the historical process of the motherland 's thriving development ; and provided effective media support for economic development and for comprehensive social progress .  Journalist workers often work under stress and harsh conditions .  
We must seize historical opportunities , accelerate reform and development of the journalistic cause , increase strength and vitality , win over the masses , and occupy the market .  We must make General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's " Three Represents " as a major ideological guide , earnestly promote the building of the ranks of journalist workers , so that our journalistic workers will become honest recorders of the progress of the times and become active builders of material and spiritual civilizations .  
Comrade Deng Xiaoping , chief architect of our country 's socialist reform and opening up , led all party comrades in emancipating their minds , seeking truth from facts , observing the characteristics of the times and the current international situation in an all-round way , summing up foreign and domestic socialist construction as well as historical and immediate experiences , and conducting difficult explorations , thus making important achievements in the theory and practice of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
Zhu Rongji said : Not long ago , President Jiang Zemin made a historical visit to Cambodia and reached extensive common understanding with King Norodom Sihanouk and Your Excellency Prime Minister on strengthening the traditional good neighborly friendship between China and Cambodia . The Chinese side wishes to make joint efforts with the Cambodian side to implement the " Joint Statement " signed by the two sides to strengthen friendship and cooperation in various fields . 
The " four educations " proposed by Comrade Jiang Zemin has grasped the fundamental issues which need to be urgently resolved in the ideological and political building of the army under the new historical conditions and embody a high degree of integration between political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity and between carrying forward the excellent traditions and propagating the spirit of the times .  It is also the basic engineering work and path for strengthening the ideological and political building of the army in the new era .  
The fruitful achievements of the " four educations " in the People 's Liberation Army and the armed police force have provided beneficial inspiration for strengthening and improving the ideological and political work in our Party and our military during the new historical period .  
We should do well the double-support work under the new situation , unite with and mobilize the broad masses of servicemen and people to strive for the fulfillment of our party 's historical tasks .  It is of important and profound significance to boosting our economic strength , to increasing our defense capabilities , to carrying forward our socialist ideology , ethics and culture , and to practicing our party 's fundamental aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .  
The plenary session pointed out that the current stage of the anti-corruption struggle in our country is carried out under the historical conditions of deepening reform , opening up wider to the outside world , changing the economic structure , and interwoven social contradictions .  
. facing this unprecedented ecological crisis , we must establish an intense sense of historical responsibility , premising our actions on the future development of mankind , taking as our starting point the sustainable development of our posterity and future generations , and pursuing a comprehensive approach and taking action .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of " three represents " was precisely put forward from the high ground of the future and destiny of the party and state on the basis of a sober understanding and accurate grasp of the domestic and international situation , the historical tasks shouldered by the party and the reality of party building , as well as on the basis of a thorough analysis and profound summary of the positive and negative experiences of the building of proletarian political parties , especially the building of our own party .  
All party comrades , and all levels of leading cadres before all , must remain committed to the historical , practical , and developmental viewpoint of Marxism , insist that practice is the sole criterion for testing truth , display history-making initiative and revolutionary creativity , and make persistent efforts to study and tackle new problems .  
This cult organization has moved against the historical current , is completely antagonistic to the scientific world , has tarnished human civilization , and has obstructed social progress .  These have determined its inevitable fate of a rapid destruction .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : Beijing must fully take its past into consideration , base itself on the present situation and have the future in mind in its urban planning and development .  While making utmost efforts to protect local historical and cultural relics , it should strive to accelerate the transformation of the old city and strive to make the city more modernized .  
He said that since the two countries established diplomatic relations 45 years ago , the friendly cooperative relationship that has been established on the basis of mutual respect , equality , and mutual benefit has made long strides and that the Sino-Syrian relations , having withstood historical upheavals , have become a model of unity and cooperation between the developing countries .  
Li Tieying pointed out in his speech , at the historic moment of the turn of the century , standing at the plane of historical materialism , Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " has made a new and scientific summation of our party 's nature , purpose , and tasks , and embodied the innovative spirit of making efforts to open up new realms in Marxism geared to the 21st century .  
Taipei Mayor Ma Ying-jeou yesterday told Hong Kong 's elite and international figures that the people of Hong Kong are assured under " one country , two systems , " and he is pleased to see the successful implementation of " one country , two systems " in Hong Kong . However , he added that Taiwan 's historical conditions and political situation are different from those of Hong Kong , so , if " one country , two systems " is compellingly implemented in Taiwan , the people of Taiwan will feel resentful .  
Closely integrated with the new , historical conditions , the entire party must conscientiously put into practice the basic strategy of governing the country according to law and governing the country by ethics , always adhere to the principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both , " further attach importance to and step up the building of socialist ethics while continuing to step up the building of democratic legal system .  
At this historical juncture , in using its social resources and in its industrial restructuring , Hong Kong must put greater stress on cost-effectiveness and on increasing its value-adding ability .  It is wise to allow an international financier to plan financial and industrial work , because he is in a better position to : understand the needs of various industries , create new ideas , amass talents , create new industries , and achieve optimum allocation of resources .  Antony Leung will , like his predecessor , handle financial matters with circumspection .  
The meeting emphasized [ as received ] that at present the vast theoretical workers must all understand the significance of shouldering responsibility , and - - on the basis of a summation of historical experiences , as well as investigation and research on realistic conditions - - strive to promote theoretical innovations and systematic innovations .  All the vast theoretical workers should make the necessary contributions required to create new prospects for the construction of the Party in the 21st century .  
A historical document made available to the public for the first time here shows that in 1945 after victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan , a representative of the then Chinese Government officially accepted the entire land and administrative right of Taiwan from the Japanese colonialists , who were occupying Taiwan at that time , thereby once again proving that Taiwan is part of China and that the so-called " theory on Taiwan 's undecided status " is basically untenable .  
Theoretical study classes and Marxist philosophy lectures were organized at all levels to help leading cadres systematically study the theory of dialectical materialism and historical materialism and to guide grass-roots officers and servicemen and cadets in military schools and academies to master the basic viewpoints of the materialist and atheist theory of Marxism .  
He said , an important guiding idea on drawing up and instituting the 10th FYP is to take system innovation and science and technology innovation as the motive force in driving economic and social development , and this is also a scientific conclusion derived from the historical experiences of reform , opening up , and modernization in China .  
NPC Deputy Wu Xiyuan said : The system of the people 's congress , the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultations under the leadership of the CPC , and the system of regional autonomy of minority nationalities are great political achievements that our party has attained and developed during the course of leading the people to carry out a long-term struggle , are the core contents of our socialist democracy with Chinese characteristics , and are a historical choice made by all the Chinese people . 
Like the whole country , over the past five years , Jiangsu scored brilliant achievements in its economic and social development , and on the whole the province completely attained the goal of enabling its people to live a relatively comfortable life with the county as a unit and realized a historical leap from just having sufficient food and clothing to living a relatively comfortable life .  Southern Jiangsu and some areas along the Chang Jiang have started ahead of time to stride toward the third-step strategic goals .  
People are in the main approaching a historical change from having enough food and clothing to enjoying a relatively comfortable life .  The average annual economic growth reached eight percent .  Economic development has brought actual benefits to people of various nationalities in Xinjiang .  
Now , we have drawn a lesson from our painful experience .  The new round of industrial revolution in today 's world , like a tidal wave , is not only posing a grim challenge to us , but also providing us with a historical opportunity whereby we can catch up with the new revolution in science and technology and achieve leap-forward development of the productive forces .  
After entering the 21st century , the deepening of interdependence between nations has surpassed the limit of human historical experiences , and a " global community " has dimly appeared in an embryonic form .  It is time for the United States , as the designer and protector for the security and economic order of the international community , to discard the diplomatic pattern of self-centered unilateralism and to rely on the coordinating and managing functions of multilateralism .  
The tremendous cohesion and the centripetal force formed through the common historical origins and cultural traditions of the Chinese nation have been encouraging one group after another of noble-minded patriots to advance wave upon wave and dauntlessly struggle for the reunification of the motherland .  
" Hong Kong 's social , political and historical conditions are different to most , if not all .  That a degree of care and attention is required , particularly in relation to the unique situation embodied in One Country , Two Systems , and the specific intent and spirit of our constitutional imperatives , i.e . the requirements of the Basic Law . "  
Yet , you always put the basic interests of our country and Hong Kong as well as those of Hong Kong people in the first place .  You have not only accepted the historical challenge and mission courageously , but also accomplished the task entrusted to you by history with outstanding achievement .  I am pleased to note that you have played a crucial role in maintaining the long-term stability and prosperity of Hong Kong .  
The new museum is located at the ruins of the Lei Yue Mun Fort , which was a defence work built by the British army in the 19th century .  The SAR Government has preserved and maintained the historical relics , and has rebuilt it into a museum for the benefit of the public , so that they may have a better understanding of Hong Kong 's coastal defence .  It is undoubtedly another cultural contribution to our community .  
We must point out that the preparation and construction of this museum has been no simple task .  While it is necessary to preserve the invaluable historical relics , it is also essential to make appropriate alterations and provide additional facilities to meet modern architectural standards .  Without the precious efforts of Mr Pau and his professional staff , this would not have been so successfully achieved .  On the other hand , the experts of the Provisional Urban Council have made great contributions in studying Hong Kong 's history and preserving invaluable historical relics .  
" Hong Kong is a commercial and financial centre with distinctive architectural landmarks of high professional standard , " he said .  " The Bank of China Tower , the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank Building , and the Convention and Exhibition Centre are superb landmarks on the Hong Kong skyline , indicative of the vibrancy and the attractiveness of this city , " Dr Leung said , " These are balanced by buildings with historical significance , such as the Western Market and the Flagstaff House Museum of Tea Ware , "  
The key areas of collection and compilation included materials on the educational , social , economical and historical aspects of Hong Kong . As services provided by the Urban Council in Hong Kong in over a century are closely related to the Hong Kong society and the livelihood of its people , their historic value will certainly be of interest to the general public and will surely be included in our collection .  
" After the reunification , the link continues and the cultural exchange programme in heritage conservation between Hong Kong and the Mainland was largely expanded .  Our joint efforts in field studies , archaeological surveys , excavation and restoration of historical building projects resulted in the discovery of a wealth of new artefacts and information .  These have greatly improved our understanding of Hong Kong 's history and its cultural , historical and economic connection with the Motherland . "  
Mrs Yau noted that the PRO selected and preserved records and historical materials that are of enduring value to the community , to provide reference and research services to help the public to gain easy access to its valuable collections on many diverse topics and formats .  
The public , professionals and the property development sector also expressed strong support for a three-pronged approach in urban renewal , including the redevelopment of dilapidated buildings ; the rehabilitation of buildings requiring repairs ; and the preservation of buildings and areas of historical , cultural or architectural interest . 
Jointly organised by the Home Affairs Department , the Heung Yee Kuk and the South China Morning Post , the Director of Home Affairs , Mrs Shelley Lau , said : " The Most Beautified Village Contest was intended not just to encourage contesting villages to carry out certain superficial improvements to their environment .  Instead , it is aimed more at effecting long-term improvements with considerable stock attached to the village 's greening activities , maintenance and preservation of its historical relics , and the ambience of the village , apart from general environmental improvements . "  
The Thematic Exhibition Hall occupying 1,000 square metres was already opened in late 1998 .  The Standing Exhibition Hall under fitting-out will be devoted to " The Story of Hong Kong " .  With 7,000 square meters of display area , this exhibition hall will present the natural and cultural changes as well as historical development taken place in Hong Kong over the past six thousand years .  Upon completion of works , the public and visitors can look into the past of Hong Kong and know more about its magnificent natural environment and cultural heritage .  
Members considered the results of a number of simulations under the model and observed that , while they were not a perfect substitute for historical experience , simulations offered two main advantages : they allowed operations to be tested under extreme conditions ; and they provided opportunities to experiment with the design of the system .  
The panel of judges comprises five experts of local history .  They will judge based on systematic use of collected materials ( especially the primary source ) , objectivity in analysis , relevancy to the theme , concrete analysis of the study subject 's historical development and quality of production .  
There were many complicated technical and architectural problems to tackle in this project , such as geotechnical structures , electrical services installations , preservation of the historical remains and natural environments as well as special environmental conditions required for the preservation and display of artefacts that have to be taken into consideration .  
In conclusion , he stressed that regulatory measures in overseas jurisdictions were varied because of their different historical backgrounds and social needs .  Overseas legislation would not be wholly applicable for Hong Kong and information collected in the research exercise was thus for reference of interested parties only .  
The Chief Curator of the Museum Dr Joseph Ting Sun-pao noted that the exhibition was the soul of the Museum and also a showcase of the dedicated hard work done by the Museum staff in the past 26 years in collecting , preserving and researching the history and development of Hong Kong . He also noted that with a rich mixture of ecological settings , panoramic screens , dioramas , interactive programmes and artefacts , the exhibition outlined the natural environment , cultural heritage and historical development of Hong Kong in a life-like manner .  
" It is no longer true that all Hong Kong people are too wrapped up in making money to pay heed and appreciate their heritage .  Perhaps a majority of them still does but a significant minority is demanding spiritual sustenance from Hong Kong 's rich heritage , be it archeological relics , historical buildings , traditional and cultural practices and all manners of antiquities .  
As an interim measure and pending the finalisation of a long term resources allocation model by HA , hospital expenditure may be allowed to exceed the historical budget allocation if the Chief Executive of HA ( CE / HA ) is satisfied that the hospital management has taken appropriate measures to control its expenditure and that the budget deficit is justified on the grounds of real service needs , and taking into consideration the total requirements within the cluster which the hospital belongs .  
It involves selecting a list of the major historical storms which had induced severe landslips or flooding , computing the rainfall amounts brought by these storms to areas of different sizes , and maximizing these rainfall amounts to those that would be obtained if the water vapour content in the storms attained the climatological maximum .  
Focusing on cultural , historical and social changes of Hong Kong and blending oriental and western cultural experiences from ancient times to the contemporary world , the Company aims to create multi-faceted artistic works .  With distinctive stage languages , styles and directions , the Company hopes to reflect the " fanatic " situation of Hong Kong in the new millennium through their productions .  
At the legislative level , sites and structures with outstanding historical and architectural / archaeological values are declared as monuments , and stringent statutory restrictions imposed to prohibit demolition and limit alteration .  
To give people a clearer impression of the technological achievements of ancient China , the National Science Hall has spent 2.5 years in preparing an exhibition , which opened March 15 , based on Chinese scientific achievements . The exhibition includes original objects , and specimens together with models and charts prepared from historical documents .  
Situated at the confluence of three rivers in the southwest corner of Taipei County , Sanhsia is an area rich in both history and natural scenery . Once a flourishing agricultural trade center and forty years ago a booming coal-mining town , Sanhsia has over the years been supported by the local tea industry and the commerce which the rivers bring . Today , one of the few places where Ching dynasty architecture and a traditional tea market ' can still be seen , Sanhsia offers much of historical significance to the visitor .  
New construction of buildings and roads is a continual danger to the city 's treasured historical architecture . Tainan County is wide and level , with an area of approximately 68 miles . With the sea on one side and fertile plains on the other , Tainan has long been favored as both a fishing and agricultural center . Its fishery fleet brings in more than 30,000 tons of fish per year .  
The materials can be divided into several major categories : chia-ku wen remains ( oracular bone inscriptions ) , ancient artifacts , original editions , government documents from the Ming and Ching dynasties , local records , and modern historical documents .  
But the historical drama played out on this beautiful stage during the following century , in which the chief actors were the Chinese , the Dutch , the Spanish , and the Japanese , has nearly vanished into the mists of antiquity . Not only is the story little known among the general public , but the field is practically unexplored among academic researchers as well .  
The main reason that scholars on Taiwan have been lax in studying the island 's seventeenth century history , Dr . Nakamura feels , is the shortage of historical materials available to them . During the seventeenth century the aborigines still lived by hunting and fishing , and the Han Chinese immigrants were mostly poor farmers and fishermen who left no written records behind , while the historical documents of the Cheng clan ( descendants of the Ming loyalist Koxinga ) were destroyed during the Ching dynasty .  
From transient visitors who left their hometowns for a temporary stay there , they have made themselves into the sector of the populace with the most economic clout on the island , but owing to special historical and geographical factors , they have been unable to shake off the psychology of transience .  
Thinking about all this from the angle of historical geography , I think northerners are used to being ruled by nomadic tribes , and the physical environment makes northerners more open-minded ; southerners , on the other hand , are the stubborn guardians of Chinese cultural traditions , so to speak , they opened up the south when they fled there to escape foreign domination , so they have a strong " spirit of resistance . " Q : Of what benefit were your two years of fieldwork ?  
Highly experienced editor Liao Chingsung , who has worked with all the new directing talent , remarks : " Society was just entering a better off phase , and with basic living requirements taken care of the audiences wanted to have more information . " The new directors were on the scene to present social and historical aspects hitherto ignored or considered taboo , at the same time as providing something for the new urban middle classes to spend their money on and talk about .  
" These 18 ob jects serve as a pretty good representation of Ming art from both inside the imperial court and out , " says National Palace Museum Vice Director Chang Lin-sheng . The Emperor Hsiao-tzung of the Ming Dynasty , for instance , with its subject 's kindly , refined expression and its harmoniously matching background , is a work of great historical value and a masterpiece of the imperial academy .  
For example , Tang dynasty IOUs , contracts and accounts of interest rates provided economic historians with important evidence . All kinds of censuses , land records and documents of civic associations brought to light the pattern of land transfers and civil activities . Yet the mass of Buddhist sutras and ancient literature was even more important for instilling new life into literary , historical and philosophical research . Tunhuang studies had begun .  
It was just unfortunate that the manuscripts came to light at the height of the wave of enthusiasm among Western scholars for archaeological research in Central Asia at the end of the nineteenth century . With the chaotic Ching court possessing neither the means nor motivation to preserve the historical relics , close to half were bought - - or misappropriated - - by foreigners and scattered throughout the West .  
The formal features of overseas Chinese buildings in Malaysia come from southern Fukien , reflecting the deep historical ties that the local immigrants have with China proper .  
A . With any kind of historical research , especially recent or contemporary , for which many of the people involved are still alive , it is comparatively easy to be coolly objective . Yet it is also , therefore , difficult to get a true picture and description .  
Today Taiwan has become famous around the globe as one of the Four Little Dragons of Asia , while the mainland has shocked the world with the bloody suppression at Tienanmen . China has entered an unprecedented historical period . In a rapidly changing international situation , with close economic and trade ties across the Taiwan Strait , we in Taiwan must squarely face the chaos and disorder appearing in society during a transitional period of democratic constitutional reform .  
Wu is the executive director of the foundation and its painful opening announcement was like a short summary of his work : " The Chinese Communists established the reform-through-labor brigades some 40 years ago . Their inmates still include so-called counter-revolutionaries , class enemies , those deemed to be against the party and socialism , religious figures , " historical " counter-revolutionaries and members of the Tienanmen democracy movement .  
Since the 1960s women in Taiwan have been entering the labor market in droves , making a major contribution to the island 's economic miracle . There are equal educational opportunities , greater opportunities in the work place , and an ever more diverse society . . . . These have allowed Taiwanese women to break through the historical Chinese mold for women as weak , dependent and subservient , revealing active , independent and self-motivated women striving for personal achievement .  
In films depicting ancient events like Mulan Enlists , they employed the incidents and the words of historical figures to either encourage patriotic sentiment in their viewers or to vilify the traitors who had shamelessly sold out their country . Although this infuriated the Japanese and their Chinese collaborators ; there was nothing specific that they could cite as a violation . This made them intolerable . "  
For apart from the historical space-time and special political and social circumstances constituted by the discourse , the " special context " which he has chosen is on the one hand inherent in the very phylogeny of the sub-genres within modern fiction , and on the other hand is a basic turning point in the development of Chinese and Western culture , highlighted by all the theories of contemporary culture and literature .  
Faced with a historical and culturat situation of apparent " change and decay in all around , " his section title From Fin-de-si ? cle to Fin-de-si ? cle , and the Four Predictions which he goes so far as to put forward , are actually a sign of his deep sense of sympathy for the time and concern for his faraway country , although this is not necessarily expressed in gloomy , sorrowful language .  
Disturbing the grave site is equally as regrettable as the loss of the objects inside the graves . When relics are discovered without relation to the excavation area and its surrounding environment , their archaeological and historical value is damaged . "  
God 's Dice collects eight of Kuo Cheng 's recent stories together . Material ranges from the middle-class escapist rhapsody of " God 's Dice , " the hell bent for leather adolescent days of " Flying Sword , " and the sordid circus antics of the political arena in " Put on a White Face , " to the driven historical mission of " The Last Proclamation " and the deranged baby killing of " How to Execute an Infant . "  
However , Chou Yu-kou says she had no wish to take on the solemn mission of the " biographer of a historical figure , " but rather that as a news reporter she simply wished to make discussion of political topics more free and information more open . Also , by writing in a style " closer to real life and to ordinary people , " she hoped to give the general public a closer understanding of politicians ' joys and sorrows and the way they think .  
But the old trails run deep into the furthest recesses of the mountain ranges , and were often cut along hunting trails and the tracks worn by wild animals , so that they are difficult for most people to reach , and with little in the way of historical records , searching them out is an extremely difficult task .  
With their saddled roofs and swallowtail ridge ends , the delicate carving on the wood and stone of their facades , and their lively chiaochihtao ( decorative ceramic panels showing scenes from historical stories in relief ) , they are a fine example of the Southern Fukienese building style .  
The essence is entirely in the trailThese small foot paths and trails have gone from being the indigenous people 's " settlement trails " in earliest times , to being " military affairs roads " or " barbarian management roads , " to being the " fitness trails , " " historical sites " and " scenic routes " of today 's national park . Their roles have often changed , but their importance is the same as of old .  
We saw old women who were living proof of the traditional model , mature women caught at the crossroads of tradition and contemporary society , and women who have crossed the historical divide and are actively creating their own space for the " new generation . "  
Over the last 80 years , the entire internal and external layout of this Japanese-occupation building has remained unchanged . Seeing the sunlight streaming in from the courtyard , casting the pattern of the long rows of windows into its quiet and lonely red-carpeted corridors , one feels a trance-like sense of historical space and time welling up irresistibly inside one .  
Q : Your book puts forward quite a few interesting observations . One of these was that certain illnesses are exclusive to Taiwan , such as " ghost phobia " and " taboo phobia . " Also , you observed that China 's historical phenomenon of communal speech-making seems similar to the modern group therapy sessions currently popular in the West .  
Hong Kong textbooks , which tend to adopt a pragmatic approach , do their utmost to avoid ideology . When describing historical incidents they mainly confine themselves to facts , and when talking about factors leading to conflicts they also do their best to avoid either laudatory or derogatory language , and try to bring out both positive and negative aspects .  
Increasingly frequent interaction between mainland China and Taiwan , their respective political climates , and the new world order taking shape in the post-Cold-War era are of course important historical backdrops , but the ominous tone of the book 's title , and related historical events which the author used as examples , were factors leading to the sensation surrounding T-Day Many people who had never even read the book joined in the debate , some were even frightened to the point of making preparations to emigrate .  
Among the historical materials in the National Palace Museum relating to Liu Mingchuan , one historical incident is particularly worthy of note : In 1884 the French , after failing in an attack of Keelung , attacked Fuzhou . The naval battle there , which took place in the afternoon of the third day of the seventh month of the lunar calendar , lasted only half an hour ( some say only seven minutes ) before the Qing 's southern fleet was defeated .  
When the Chinese wallpaper that was admired for its fresh colors and lively flowers and birds came under the dark aesthetic of the Gothic search for historical roots , it was described as having " harsh colors " and being " too lavish in imitating nature . "  
For instance , in recording oral history about the February 28 incident , people previously put the stress on external facts , such as witnesses who saw people being tortured , etc . Now the focus has turned to the suffering imposed by the entire process and how the experience affected people inside . This is a change in historical perspective .  
The report that was published at the time clearly stated the entire range of the site , and furthermore requested relevant units to " quickly plan preservation of certain areas and designate them protected historical landmarks . "  
Furthermore , too many units are in charge of historical landmarks and cultural artifacts , so that no one knows whom to follow . For example , historical landmarks are administered by the Ministry of the Interior , but antique objects inside protected historical buildings are administered by the Ministry of Education . The central , provincial , county and municipal governments all have " cultural personnel " with the same general function . The resulting mish-mash of authority and responsibility means that in the end the affair falls into the pattern of no one managing at all .  
Taking the February 28 incident for example , historical data on the incident has been reconstructed bit by bit from oral testimony . Because of inadequacies in the relevant documentary materials , it is only through set after set of interviews that basic evidence has been acquired . Thus we can learn , for example , what happened in each locality , and find out about the lives of those killed or injured .  
Should other historical reconstructions , for example those about Taiwanese soldiers or the February 28 incident , be seen in a similar light ? Another easily overlooked pitfall of oral history is that the viewpoint of the interviewer or editor will be imposed on the interviewee , or cultural or humanistic viewpoints will be superimposed and unwittingly enter the thinking of the respondent . These external ideas and interpretations may shape the memories of the interviewee , so that he or she ends up spouting someone else 's point of view without even realizing it .  
" Having been stripped of rank , status and family , all these men had left was direct and honest communication with others , " Yu writes of those banished to the northeast . ( page 48 ) Relying on a rich historical imagination , Yu finds the spirit of exile in scant lines of poetry the exiled have left behind and shows the traditional noble spirit of the Chinese literati in their efforts to help others in times of trouble .  
Wei recalls that he started reading the magazine in his freshman year at college , before people were free to speak as they pleased , yet the magazine was very bold about what it published . The historical documents were more stimulating and comprehensive than his formal history education at university .  
Deputy Director of the Academia Historica Chu Chung-sheng believes that Liu Shao-tang 's collection and organization of historical materials has definitely made a " comprehensive " contribution to Chinese history , especially that of the period of entrenched hostility between the ROC and the PRC after the civil war . Many major figures in modern history did not make it to Taiwan , and from this point the accounts about them become like a kite whose string has been snapped . Fortunately , some material on these historical personages has been recorded in Biographical Literature .  
While warfare provided partial impetus for the invention of ingenious new weaponry , " the emergence of the wooden ox was no historical accident , " asserts Wang Jian , conveying his enthusiasm for the history of Chinese mechanical science . " It was just one among a series of technological inventions . " During the Spring and Autumn period the brilliant craftsman Lu Ban created an unusual carriage for his mother , driven by a wooden figure .  
It is an historical asset that is part of the collective memories of the people who live in Taiwan , and also provides living instruction about the history of railroads here , and could also be a concrete way for the government to show their concern for Taiwan 's native culture . " It has more meaning from the perspective of cultural preservation and education . "  
While they wait for the museum , much of the historical heritage has been disappearing , particularly over the last decade . Many branch lines have closed , and a number of wooden stations which had great character have been torn down and replaced . Many precious carriages , after being withdrawn from service , have not found a happy retirement home , but have been sold off for scrap at a price of NT $ 5 per kilogram . " In some cases they did n't even keep one ! "  
In October last year it was reported that Taichung Station was to be moved underground , and that the old station building , which dates from the Japanese occupation era , might be demolished . The RCS joined with several other cultural and historical associations to put on a campaign to plead for the life of the 80-year-old station , including an event in which groups rode trains from both north and south to meet in Taichung . Finally they managed to get the station building designated a Grade 2 national monument by the Ministry of the Interior .  
Meanwhile , the main regulations governing Taiwan 's relations with Hong Kong have been largely completed . July 1997 will not merely be a starting point for Tung and the people of Hong Kong . Taiwanese , mainland Chinese , overseas Chinese , and Asia-watchers everywhere are waiting with bated breath . Tung is indeed bearing an unprecedented historical burden .  
As always on other inspection tours of historical sites over many decades , Professor Lin Heng-tao wore his " patented " uniform : a plastic Tianlan washing powder bag and a pair of big , battered old leather shoes . But what was different was that when this old gentleman-now after all in his eighties-appeared on the scene with bent back , clutching a walking stick and with a nurse tagging along behind , some people were deeply shocked .  
Taiwan in those days was wilderness , but the wide-open land and bountiful resources continued to attract Han Chinese from the coastal areas of Fujian and Guangdong . According to historical sources , the population of coastal Fujian and Guangdong in that era was highly concentrated , with mountainous areas outweighing habitable ones , which further intensified the attraction of Taiwan for the Han .  
The Academia Sinica is quite confident in stating that researchers of early and medieval imperial Chinese history , for instance , can regard the on-line Twenty-Five Books of History as primary sources . For researchers of late imperial China from the Song dynasty on , because there are abundant historical materials , the materials of this archive are not the only ones available , but they certainly should not be overlooked .  
In September 1994 the Cultural Committee of the Preparatory Committee began to formally discuss such matters as the names and emblems of government departments and agencies , arrangements for public holidays , the design and issue of postage stamps , the content of school textbooks , recognition of academic qualifications and so on , and also affirmed the principle of removing the visible trappings of colonial rule . Since then , wave after wave of actions to remove historical symbols has swept through both the public and private sectors .  
Leaving aside the earliest relations between man and elephant , it was beginning in the 16th and 17th centuries , when Europeans first penetrated the continent , that the African elephant began to face mass slaughter . After three centuries of killing , the elephant population was devastated . In Capetown , South Africa , for example , when the government established the national park in 1931 , there were only 11 elephants , compared to the historical peak when at least 100,000 elephants roamed the grassy plain .  
" To be honest , from a greater historical perspective , it would be pushing it to call Wistaria House a ' real ' historic landmark , " says Huang Fu-san , director of the Academica Sinica 's Institute of Taiwan History . However , the Taipei city government decided to list Wistaria House as a landmark . The committee is trying to set a new example whereby historic landmarks are judged not only by external criteria , but by their individual " personality " and history as well .  
Architecture scholar Wang Chen-hwa says that there are three kinds of historic building restoration : The first is untouched preservation , leaving a building how it is without touching a thing . Secondly , when a building has urban historical significance , there is restored preservation . Thirdly , if the building is still connected to people 's lives and is usable , a preservation method that involves active utilization of the building can be adopted . " Historic buildings are living and changing all the time , " he says .  
" There does not need to be a conflict between the needs of urban development and historical building preservation , " says Tseng Shu-cheng , an assistant professor in Tamkang University 's Architecture Department . Preserving historic buildings or spaces is not intended to stop time and halt development . On the contrary it is intended to use their historical essence to make a new and creative use of the space .  
Given that , based on historical experience , forces in an amphibious assault are only about one-third as effective as on land ( i.e . effective fighting capability declines by two-thirds ) , unless the PRC develops transport and supply ships capable of carrying and supporting large numbers of troops , it would be very difficult to invade Taiwan .  
" I hope in the future we can trek once per year , passing through traditional lands and places of historical importance , to understand how the West Rukai spread . We will also survey the natural resources . " Sasala says that elders told him many things he did not know-about things that happened long ago , and that place names were often derived from commonly used plants . Creating a foundation of shared knowledge among the generations marks the beginning of transmission of the tribal culture .  
Huang Chien-yi also reveals that in a future textbook edition which is still at the experimental stage , historical and mythical exemplary personages have almost disappeared , and the few remaining representative persons are all taken from daily life . The old style of teaching loyalty and filial piety by expecting children to model themselves on saints and sages is to disappear .  
By the same reasoning , qi which condenses with sufficient harmony may be unchanging and maintain its form eternally . Humans live between heaven and earth , and can participate in the processes by which heaven and earth are nourished and life created and changed . The Yi Jing ( Book of Changes ) lays great stress on the continuous burgeoning of life within the vast universe . Thus we can see that there is a historical background to the continuous emergence of ideas concerning elixirs of immortality and fairylands peopled by immortals .  
Lu Dongbin was a Tang-dynasty historical figure who trained himself in the Daoist arts in hopes of becoming an immortal . He has long since passed into popular lore as an immortal with a strong preference for the company of women . He is well-known for his flirtations with a famous courtesan , and for his frequent drunken revelry at the Yueyang Pavilion .  
Liu Tseng-kui , a research associate at the Academia Sinica 's Institute of History and Philology , created History Links ' basic structure out of his personal collection of website bookmarks , accumulated over years of combing overseas websites for historical data for his research . In the course of his research , Liu discovered that while there was no dearth of literary and historical websites in Taiwan , there were few online collections of links to such sites . He therefore assembled his own site last year , dividing his vast collection of bookmarks into categories .  
Professor Rolf Trauzettel of the University of Bonn also observes that the ideas of Confucianists of different historical periods were not entirely the same , and that these ideas were often encumbered with political aims and made into instruments of rule by those in power . Early Confucianist thinking was basically constructed on the level of morality and personal integrity , so it is unlikely to have had either a positive or a negative influence on China 's modernization and economic development .  
" The fact that aboriginal cultures are ' living cultures ' allows the Sheng Ye Museum to adopt an unusual style of exhibition , " explains Hsu Kung-ming , associate research fellow at the National Museum of Natural Science . " Unlike many other museums which must rely on displays of historical artifacts , the Sheng Ye Museum pays equal attention to collecting reproductions of antique styles , modern works of aboriginal art , and exhibiting displays created by contemporary craftsmen .  
Amidst the excitement and fury of a new tide of literary activity , 26-year-old Wang Anyi published The Falling Rain , a romantic short story about Wenwen walking through the rain in hopes of running across a boy she had once happened to meet . According to Sung Ju-shan , " Under the communist regime , with its stress on historical materialism , no one had ever before published a story that focused on the emotions of an adolescent girl .  
Chung 's favorite subject is an ancient gate built in Neipu 's Fungtien Village in the 26th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing dynasty ( ca . 1901 ) and recently declared a historical building . But in his paintings the gate differs somewhat from the way it looks today . " I paint it in the colors it had when I was a child . The houses have been repainted several times since then and have lost their original feeling , " says Chung , who grew up in Neipu .  
Viewing this demographic shift within its proper historical context , however , sheds a different light on the issue . Water resources were seldom located in the plains ; rather , they were most accessible along the middle reaches of rivers . This was a key reason why Taiwan 's early Hakkas chose to live in the hills .  
" Hsinchu residents seem conservative and parochial on the surface , " says Chen Mei-chun , a researcher with Dandelion Workshop , " but once you have made contact you find that they can be very flexible , and highly spontaneous . " When Chen was studying at Tsinghua University she spent some time filming a documentary and collecting historical material in the Chincheng New Village , a military dependants settlement just across from the university .  
A half-century ago , our image of the Han period still rested entirely upon what we could learn from historical records , but all that changed beginning in 1972 thanks to a series of major archeological finds at a number of tombs dating back to the Han dynasty . A huge quantity of silks , wooden tomb figurines , bamboo slips used for writing , and other burial items cast an entirely new light upon the way Chinese people lived two millennia ago .  
Over 70% of Tungshih 's population is of Hakka ancestry , and both civic organizations and ordinary people have preserved large numbers of Hakka artifacts and much historical material . After the earthquake , the Taichung County Hakka Cultural Association realized that these valuable cultural and historical assets might be destroyed by the bulldozers as damaged houses were demolished . They urged the Tungshih Township authorities to slow down the demolition work , to give them a few days ' time to save what they could .  
From the time of Emperor Wu Di onwards , in the middle period of the Western Han dynasty , the government and people really began to focus on developing education . The rank of " Doctor of the Five Classics " was created , a purely academic post that involved historical and political research but had no specific political functions . As time went on , however , incumbents of the post began to be drawn into administrative matters and take on a political role .  
The DPP does not carry the historical burden of this conflict , and has already relaxed its ideological limitations . I was born and raised in Taiwan , and all my family and assets are here in Taiwan . My fate is linked to the fate of the vast majority of Taiwan 's people . I think this is the basic reason why the DPP is better positioned to deal with cross-strait relations than the KMT .  
Liu Shao-tang , who in the course of his life rescued or brought to light countless quantities of Republican-era historical materials , and was variously described as " single-handedly the equal of a nation " and " head of the ' unofficial Academia Historica , ' " never sought fame or fortune , and was always affable , cordial and sincere .  
As Liu Shao-tang explained in Volume 64 , No . 2 : " From the struggle between Sun and Huang in the early years of the Republic , through the chaos of the warlord era and the North-South standoff , to the periods of cooperation and conflict between the Nationalists and the Communists , Yu witnessed countless political struggles . He saw how much historical data was distorted or destroyed , how right was turned into wrong and black into white , and how whoever won the battles also won history .  
The situation in the US made me aware of the gap between rich and poor , and I came to realize that race has a lot to do with it . The tension between whites and blacks in America is very obvious , and my academic training gave me a way to analyze the situation and place it in its proper historical context . I learned that gender is n't the only dividing line in society ; there are also class and racial divisions .  
On the subject of cross-strait relations , Chen stressed that the people of Taiwan and mainland China share a common ancestral , cultural , and historical background , and he stated his belief that the leaders on both sides have the wisdom and creativity to jointly deal with the question of a future " one China . "  
Anything to lift us above the humdrum reality of daily life . It 's the same old story : events get embellished with every telling until they enter the realm of myth . For example , look how folklore has handled the characters of Zhuge Liang and Guan Gong . The historical record shows that the real Guan Gong did n't even have moustache , let alone the bushy beard that he 's now credited with in the popular imagination .  
Moreover , Kurth draws parallels between the main character in Notes and Taiwan 's current situation in the world : " That Taiwan is under permanent siege , threatened by a larger mass , mainland China , is an obvious but essential metaphor in Chu 's novel of gay men facing the truth about their mortality . Living on borrowed time and borrowed culture , caught between the ersatz pleasures of the West and the call of historical destiny . . . . "  
Lan Po-chou believes that Taiwanese historiography needs to be developed concurrently on an official level , through the full opening of archives , and on an individual one , through oral history . Only by rigorously pursuing both these lines of historical inquiry in tandem can the true history of Taiwan be recovered .  
The " one priority " was arts education . The " two legs to walk on " was a reference to the importance of state-run professional opera troupes and the encouragement of private theater troupes . And the talk about " three items of equal importance " meant that traditional opera , contemporary opera , and newly composed works dealing with historical subjects were all equally deserving of attention .  
When the KMT was voted out of the presidency last year after a half century in power , many worried that the Republic of China had come to an end , but our national identity is only clearer now that the Taiwan-oriented DPP has come to power . The ROC comprises the territory of Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen , and Matsu . Only a ruling party free of historical baggage can take the bold surgical steps needed to rid the country of long-festering tumors .  
But the name has historical significance . When the earliest Han Chinese settlers moved into the local area ( today part of Shihkang Rural Township ) , there was frequent conflict between the Chinese and the Aborigines . To minimize disputes , a Chinese official ordered a large moat dug just downstream from where Tuniu Elementary is located today . Next to the moat the Chinese piled up 19 large defensive earthen mounds .  
Chen Yuh-jean says there is no need for frustration . World Heritage guidelines place special importance on the agreement and cooperation of local residents . " So long as people are enlightened about the real value of the old Mountain Line , " he says , speaking of one of the sites less likely to make the final cut , " and preserve its historical and cultural value and develop only economic activities that are compatible with those values , then ten years from now it may find itself at the top of the list . "  
But the reason why the Chin-kuashih-Chiufen area can be considered a world heritage asset , argues Monica C . Kuo , president of the Chinese Institute of Landscape Architects in Taiwan , is that its historic impact extended far and wide . From a historical perspective , the gold produced in Chinkuashih and Chiufen profoundly influenced the economic and colonial history of Asia in the first half of the last century .  
Academia Sinica professor Chen Kuo-tung , who served as chief editor of Leaves in the Wind , is quick to concede that the historical materials in the book have to be taken with a grain of salt , but argues that it makes a valuable contribution by bringing together scattered impressions of Taiwan that Westerners have had over a span of more than three centuries , thus giving local readers a chance to understand what their homeland has looked like to foreigners .  
" Although salaries were very low , the work had a clear objective and someone was looking out for us in our lives . It was like growing up in a warm family , and none of the men who worked together in Lintienshan will ever forget it , " says Chuang Ming-yi , a true second-generation Lintienshaner who was born here , grew up here , currently works in the forestry work station , and is also in charge of the Lintienshan cultural and historical workshop .  
Not long after the founding of the cultural and historical workshop , Chuang Ming-yi 's own mother fell ill with cancer . During the two years of running back and forth between the mountain town and hospitals , Chuang developed a deep understanding of life and death .  
She has done nearly 30 serials , totaling more than 1000 hours . While she has worked in numerous genres , including wuxia ( stories of Chinese chivalric martial arts masters ) , historical , period , and romantic , she is especially well-known for wuxia dramas . Virtually every one of her wuxia serials has won or been nominated for several Golden Bell Awards , setting the standard for this format .  
Ever since Hero premiered in the mainland , the debate surrounding the film has become all the more intense . Many mainlanders were more than a bit dissatisfied with director Zhang Yimou 's presentation of history , specifically questioning the historical veracity of his portrayal of the infamous first Qin emperor ( Qinshihuang ) as an enlightened ruler who saved both China and its people . Hong Kong audiences had their own gripes with the film .  
In imposing its rule over Taiwan , Japan deliberately gave concrete forms to its imperial authority , as we can see from many historical documents . For example , there were precise rules governing the number of buttons , the weapons , and the shoes of ordinary policemen . With the adoption of such detailed forms , throughout society a new body language took shape that expressed degrees of authority . You can still see this in the body language of older people .  
Yao observes that given its special historical background Taiwan has shown an innate ability to integrate elements of Eastern and Western cultures and believes that how this quality is utilized will determine whether Taiwan is able to create a new culture . However , if people blindly restrict themselves or fall into the trap of " material determinism " wherein form transcends essence , or excessively highlight regionalism , either one can just as easily lead towards the dead end of " exclusive localism . "  
Many years ago , Nanfang Shuo became interested in the origins of language . Taking vocabulary often seen in the reporting of news events as his starting point , he set about tracing the historical origins of certain words and phrases whilst also discussing the process by which their meaning in society has evolved . For example , researching the Chinese expression for " mafia " ( heidao , literally " black way " ) Nanfang Shuo conducted a textual search of references to black and the metaphorical implications of the color to Chinese people .  
The Cultural Bureau of Taichung County last year organized the teachers ' pilgrimage group so as to disseminate understanding of the religious meaning of the pilgrimage and its transforming spiritual power . This year it added groups of volunteers who explained the cultural and historical significance of the festival and recounted their personal experiences with the majesty and power of the tradition .  
It occupies an area of nearly 12,000 square meters , and cost NT $ 380 million to build . The idea for its design came from the historical vicissitudes of the archeological discoveries , and from the first peoples who crossed the sea in boats to come to Taiwan . The museum is built in three disparate architectural styles , representing the connection between mountains and sea , between past and present . The arched steel-framed structure symbolizes the sea , with the structural layout employing outward radiating lines to indicate the ocean .  
Unlike most temples , which have employed tile and concrete for a speedy reconstruction , the Paoan Temple used good materials and hired skilled artisans . A grade-two historical site , the temple was restored in a slow and careful manner .  
Yet , while his improvements on traditional designs were meeting with great approval , they were n't satisfying his creative desires . From an early age he had been a great lover of painting and very familiar with historical folktales , so he decided to leave the ranks of craftsmen , breaking free from the shackles of tradition , and to adopt innovative styles using Western realism to create new works that more richly displayed a purely artistic creativity .  
Because of my personal interest in collecting , I 've spent over 20 years doing field research . I 've come in contact with a lot of extremely valuable first-hand materials and seen many aspects of our past that do n't get mentioned in formal historiography . As a result , I 've come to feel strongly that history does n't really come alive unless you approach it from a lot of different angles and look at historical development as something pushed forward by an entire people .  
For 40 years the authorities labeled this tragic historical event as an uprising against legitimate authority . It was only in 1987 , after the lifting of martial law , with the formation of the " 228 Peace Promotion Association , " that efforts got underway to reverse unjust verdicts , rediscover the historical truth , and achieve reconciliation in society .  
When combined with the growing leisure farming industry , this restoration takes on even more importance . All along the 9.6-kilometer Niutou-Sanhsing section of the Taipingshan railroad , a variety of beautiful natural vistas greet the eye-soaring mountains , creeks and valleys , fields , villages , and small towns . All this has great tourism potential , and aside from spurring the growth of peripheral industries such as accommodation and food service , it also has a great historical importance .  
Thinking back on his childhood , Yeh says that his father often used the free time outside the busy farming season to recite Chinese historical serial novels to his neighbors . Yeh was deeply influenced by his father and loved reading . Under the supervision of NTNU professor Tang Tsu-chung , he read a lot of biographical literature . For this reason Yeh learned that modern Chinese history is made up of heroic figures whose successful deeds were all made possible by " idealism , hope , and determination . "  
A related inscription can still be found near the Fuyu Temple located in the old part of Tanshui . In order to familiarize people with Taiwan and the Customs Museum , whenever Yeh travels or undertakes on-site study in Taiwan or abroad , he distributes the promotional brochures he carries around , hoping that people will visit alternative historical sites and museums , which are often not on the beaten track . Then they will realize the truth of the saying that " when historic figures have faded away , the city will remain .  
Nonetheless , when you push open one thick , heavy , lacquered door after another , you are welcomed not by some literary or historical figures of the Republican era , but by dazzling and brightly lit restaurants with spacious , modern decor in an " alternative " style .  
It is important to remember that of the types of evidence commonly used in historical research-documents , maps , archeological finds , anthropological tools ( plant life , DNA ) , social structure and language-only documents and maps can be accurately dated and can be used to directly determine historical facts ; the other types can only provide indirect data which , while decisive in supporting documents and maps , in itself can only suggest inferential conclusions .  
Rising almost 4000 meters above sea level , Yushan is not only the tallest peak on Taiwan , it is also the source of the three major river systems that provide water for the island , has the most intact ecological system , verdant forests , varied flowers and fauna plus the nearby historical relics of Patungkuan and the rich cultural history of the Aborigines . " It is natural that this area is a topographical symbol of Taiwanese identity , just like Mt . Fuji in Japan or the Alps in Switzerland , " says Professor Tai .  
It was also at this time that the family adopted corporate management methods . On display alongside the shoulder pole-with its dark , shiny surface hinting at a long history-are a number of other important historical mementos from the company 's past , including a ceiling beam , a brick , and a foundation stone quarried in northern Taipei 's Chili-an district . All these items were taken from the original building before it was torn down to be replaced by the new company headquarters building .  
" Hard " thinking , based on military aggression and economic hegemony , has long dominated the fate and historical development of mankind , several times leading the world to the brink of extinction . Therefore Lu placed special emphasis on the spirit of cooperation and sharing , on " soft thinking " that can lead to win-win situations , pluralism , and mutual coexistence and prosperity . She urged that the Pacific be managed as a " soft ocean " of sustainable development .  
Built to last " This project has struck a balance between using modern preservation techniques and traditional crafts . The utmost effort has been made to restore the original historical appearance of the site , and the careful attention to detail is highly significant in both religious and architectural terms . "  
Hungary is a small nation that al-ways held itself aloof from the rest of the world , but was also plagued by countless calamities , and was time and again " liberated " by foreign nations . After the great catastrophe of the Tatar ( Mongol ) invasion , Hungary enjoyed several centuries of peace and growth . In the 16th century , the Ottoman Turks invaded Hungary , and occupied it for 150 years . The Turks left a historical legacy of Turkish baths and Byzantine architecture , which remain to this day . . . .

Morocco , which opted for dialogue as a fundamental principle in its policy vis - - vis its neighbours , propounded that principle in international forums as the best means of avoiding armed conflict and sought to settle all problems by peaceful means , remains convinced that its historical ties with Spain , coupled with the two countries ' common economic interests , will help overcome the difficulties that stand in the way of a solution to this dispute . 
A decisive factor in the success of those nonviolent revolutions was the experience of social solidarity ; in the face of regimes backed by the power of propaganda and terror , that solidarity was the moral core of the power of the powerless , a beacon of hope and an enduring reminder that it is possible for man 's historical journey to follow a path which is true to the finest aspirations of the human spirit .  
In particular , the Secretariat would be requested to provide orally an estimate of the cost of the relevant document before it is demanded by Member States , stricter page limits would be established , oral reports would be encouraged , the Secretariat would be asked to consolidate reports on related topics , repetitive historical material would be eliminated and the use of paperless technology would be promoted .

The current session of the General Assembly is particularly important in the historical development of the United Nations , not only because we are celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the creation of an exceptional institution of universal scope , which was established to analyse , debate and seek solutions to problems of common concern to mankind , but also because current circumstances lend themselves to reflection regarding the future of our Organization .  
These variable criteria are subject to historical , human , demographic , political , economic , territorial and other changes .  
In this spirit , before I described some specific reform recommendations my delegation is advancing in connection with the current agenda item , it would be helpful to the Assembly 's consideration of these ideas for me to preface them with four essential points : the diagnostic framework ; the historical context ; and the premises and the paramount objective that underlie our proposals .  
The successful peaceful transition of South Africa to a democratic and non-racial society with human rights safeguarded by an entrenched Charter of Fundamental Rights has nevertheless left cultural , economic and social inequalities reflecting historical deprivation .  
Needless to say , the tragic events triggered by the military coup d ' \ x { 5f4b } at during the night of 20-21 October 1993 can not be viewed in isolation ; they should be considered in the light of their historical , political , economic and social background .  
When I left Rwanda , with mixed feelings , I was convinced that the Rwandese people , with the help of the international community , including the help of the United Nations and African neighbours , would surely be able to master their own future and destiny , on the basis of an in-depth analysis and digest of the historical experience and lessons .  The Rwandese people are faced with a very arduous task of rehabilitation and reconstruction .

While agreeing with such an approach from a historical point of view , members of the Committee believe that it can not form a basis for viable technology-related policy and that the main thing is not to look for a uniform comprehensive category or a definition of what constitutes science and technology for development , but rather to identify the real cause of the drawback to building the endogenous scientific and technological capacities of developing countries .

In order to be able to understand these political ramifications in their historical context , we must consider this phenomenon in the context of the flexibility and inflexibility that characterize the structure of the contemporary system of international relations .  That is because the crisis afflicting current international political relations has been caused largely by the persistence of complex political and historical dilemmas that have continued to interact within a system of international relations based on visions formulated by the allies before the end of the Second World War .  
Because we are small and peaceful , and because we have a lengthy history , we bring to the United Nations a vision of the world that is patient and optimistic , and it is our belief that if we have lived in our territory without bellicose conflict for more than 700 years , the same is also possible beyond our borders , for , in the end , the men and women who live in Andorra are different from the rest of mankind only in their collective historical experience .  
It is nevertheless regrettable that historical factors and the constraints imposed by the external economic environment , including a reduction in official development assistance , the heavy debt burden , deteriorating terms of trade , and increased barriers impeding access to developed country markets have prevented any fundamental improvement in the economic situation .

Factors which give rise to racism and racial discrimination were examined at the seminar on the political , historical , economic , social and cultural factors contributing to racism , racial discrimination and apartheid held at Geneva from 10 to 14 December 1990 .

The Council reviewed the economic developments under way in the international arena and reached two basic conclusions : that globalization is inexorably making its presence felt in the world and leaving its stamp on this historical era ; and that this fact makes it imperative to establish strong economic entities that are able to cope with it and the developments it brings with it without falling prey to economic convulsions that are prejudicial to the prosperity of citizens .  
Affirms that globalization is a complex historical process of structural transformation , with numerous interdisciplinary aspects , and has a direct impact on the full enjoyment of all human rights , in particular the right to development , at both the national and the international level ;

No absolute laws about such a complex , multifaceted and controversial historical process are likely to be found , but a few tentative historical and theoretical lessons can be drawn .  
The ambivalence in capitalist development analysed by great theoreticians has in general been confirmed by historical experience : positive and negative , creative and destructive , beneficial and detrimental features are combined in this system , and their relative weights have been changing at different times and in different national and international contexts .  
Among general lessons is the importance of historical and contemporary diversity of national economic systems and trajectories within each great systemic family , and in the process of shifting from the socialist to the capitalist family ( Chavance and Magnin , 1998 ) .  
Recognizing that States have developed different cultural and historical uses for firearms and that the purpose of enhancing international cooperation to eradicate illicit transnational trafficking in firearms is not to discourage or diminish lawful leisure or recreational activities such as travel or tourism for sport shooting , hunting and other forms of lawful ownership and use of firearms that are recognized by States Parties ,

I have been struck by the deep historical resonances of this process , for when the United Nations was established at the end of the Second World War , part of its rationale as an organization was to have been the impartial and objective resolution of international problems , free of the old cycles of retribution through resort to aggression .  
Unless the imposition of cultures and artificial borders by colonial Powers is recognized as an essential historical factor in many current conflicts and unless the right to independence and self-determination is accepted and the diversity of cultures and models comprehended , conflicts will continue .  
The forthcoming worldwide celebration of this epic turning point in time is an occasion imbued with profound historical , religious , spiritual and cultural dimensions of high importance for our people , for the other peoples of the region , for the faithful and for the entire international community .  
The Second Protocol goes further to develop the Conventions protective powers with regard to military involvement and the need to strengthen the system of protection for those categories of cultural property deemed of vital importance to mankind or whose exceptional cultural and historical value is recognized by national legislation .  
My delegation reaffirms its strong conviction that it is necessary to strengthen and extend every possible form of cooperation among all countries within the framework of mutual respect , respect for international law and the relevant international conventions , in order to ensure , at the international level , the protection and restoration of archaeological , historical and cultural treasures .  
We hope that international efforts will bear fruit and that the restoration of cultural properties to their legitimate owners will be encouraged , so that our various cultural heritages , which not only have historical and ancestral value but which also represent the intellectual and moral heritage of future generations , can be preserved .  
They are unilateral attempts to change the legal , historical and demographic composition of the occupied territories and are aimed at imposing a fait accompli on the ground prior to the final status negotiations to determine the fate of the Palestinian people and its attempt to establish its independent State on its national soil , as other peoples of the world have done .

The historical and , alas , still actual misuse of religions and moral philosophies with a universal intent for purposes of domination and control should not obscure the evidence that the sharing of a common humanity is fundamental to the human race .  
Since the Summit , policies and programmes to achieve social development have been implemented within the context of national economic , political , social , legal , cultural and historical environments .

Fourthly , conflict prevention actions , whether of an operational or structural nature , should be sensitive not only to existing local conditions , but also to the historical and cultural contexts of a potential conflict .  
This infamous decree lunatic , ludicrous and amply reflective of a pre-planned , diabolical scheme by the ruling Pakistani junta , the main force behind the Talibanization of the region is aimed at the annihilation of the historical and cultural identity of Afghanistan .  
It is thus absolutely incomprehensible to us that , in this day and age , the mind of a human being could entertain the senseless idea of destroying , in cold blood and for reasons having nothing to do with public utility , archaeological monuments whose value to humanity resides not only in their artistic merits and historical interest , but also in the venerability they derive from their association with one of the most ancient religions in the world .  
Some delegations expressed the view that the brief historical summary on the consideration in the Legal Subcommittee of the question on the definition and delimitation of outer space , which the working group had requested the Secretariat to prepare , would be most useful for the continued discussions in 2002 , as it would assist in identifying positions that had developed over the years under the item and reduce the likelihood of a repetition of previous discussions .  
Last but not least , Iraq must , once and for all , close its painful chapter in relation to Kuwait , by showing full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the State of Kuwait and returning its historical and cultural heritage , including Kuwaiti archives , as well as repatriating missing Kuwaiti persons .

In 1975 , after enduring periods of foreign domination , colonization and neo-colonialism , his countrys multi-ethnic people had chosen a political system suited to their historical , economic , social and cultural particularities .  
This inadmissible claim highly simplifies a complex historical and social matter ; it ignores the military and financial autonomy of the paramilitaries and the extremely clear and increasing instances of lethal acts of aggression against public servants .  
Recalling that , according to the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights , the international community must treat all human rights globally in a fair and equal manner , on the same footing and with the same emphasis , and that while the significance of the national and regional particularities and various historical , cultural and religious backgrounds must be borne in mind , it is the duty of States , regardless of their political , economic and cultural systems to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
Recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial Powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation , and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;  
Stress the negative economic consequences of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , conscious that the economic difficulties of Africa can not be explained exclusively by foreign factors and historical events and aware that it is nevertheless a reality that those factors and events have had profound crippling effects on the economic development of Africa and that justice now requires that substantial national and international efforts be made to repair the damage ;  
Affirm that the first logical and credible step to be taken at this juncture of our collective struggle is for the World Conference to declare solemnly that the international community as a whole fully recognizes the historical injustices of the slave trade and that colonialism and apartheid are among the most serious and massive institutionalized forms of human rights violations ;

We recall the historical fact that among the most hideous manifestations of racial discrimination the African continent and Diaspora have suffered , namely the slave trade , all forms of exploitation , colonialism and apartheid , were essentially motivated by economic objectives and competition between colonial powers for strategic territorial gains , appropriation and control over and pillage of natural and cultural resources ;  
We recall that , without the necessary political will to recognize and assume responsibility for historical injustices and their contemporary forms and repercussions [ modern slavery and slavery-like practices , ] programmes of action against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , as well as the anti-racist slogans and measures adopted at the World Conference and at the regional and national levels , will not change deeply ingrained prejudices or achieve the noble goal of a genuine human family based on equal dignity and opportunities ;  
[ Calls upon all relevant United Nations organs to endeavour to bring the foreign occupation of Jerusalem by Israel , together with all its racist practices , to an end , and to ensure the recognition of Jerusalem as a city of reverence and religious sanctity for the three major religions of the world which should serve as a focal point of historical and cultural inspiration , a symbol of civilization and religious dialogue and an epitome of tolerance and equality ] ;
