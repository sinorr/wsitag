" In the past , the focus of what scholars came in contact with in music was this type of political , ritual music .

That concern was evoked by the fact that the situation in the occupied territories was growing worse each day , as shown by the total blockade of the territories and the restrictions imposed on freedom of movement , which , in turn , had a catastrophic impact on the economic and social situation , health care , education and freedom of religion . 
Accordingly , Israel is unable , at this juncture , to commit itself to a total ban on the use of anti _ personnel landmines until effective alternative measures are available to ensure the protection of civilians threatened on a daily basis by terrorists , and to ensure the protection of Israeli defence forces operating in areas of armed conflict .  
After extensive consultations , the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me that , since no additional resources had been authorized under resolution 1111 ( 1997 ) , the needs of vulnerable groups would be met outside the framework of the resolution .  I am glad to report that the United Nations has been creative in preparing the plan for the three northern governorates and was able to increase the resources for some key sectors through reallocations within the total amount of funds available .  
As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on sources for the financing of development ( see A / 52 / 399 ) , there has been a shift in the composition of financial flows to developing countries from public to private sector sources , with the latter now accounting for an overwhelming share of the total ( albeit not for all individual countries ) .  This situation is unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future .  
Despite the adoption of the Paris Declaration and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s , [ 29 ] there has been a decline in real terms of total official development assistance for least developed countries and continued marginalization of those countries , and their number has increased from 41 to 48 without a proportionate increase in support measures despite national and international efforts .

While no one can yet accurately estimate the total number of items at large or which areas are contaminated , historic estimates have assumed 3-million anti-personnel landmines , and recent government estimates suggest that as much as 13,000 square kilometres ( a quarter of the land surface of Croatia ) , are being treated as suspected mined areas . 
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .

Even though the total number of peacekeeping operations and their average size have been reduced in recent years , peacekeeping is still the key instrument available to the United Nations in discharging its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
Albania has a peculiar history of chronic isolation , of almost total estrangement from the rest of the world , of great potential , human and natural wealth , while being , at the same time , underdeveloped and poor .  Our difficulties of growth are directly linked to the legacies of former rules and half a century of communism , of non-existent , non-functioning or malfunctioning democratic institutions , both during and after the collapse of communism and its structures , as well as with our mentality .  
However , in spite of some positive developments in the area of arms regulation and disarmament in the past year , we can not be too sanguine about these achievements in the absence of any real or substantial progress made in the area of the further reduction of nuclear weapons leading to their total elimination .  
It was a positive contribution by the Court to the realization of the goal of total elimination of nuclear weapons , which must be pursued by the international community if we are to eliminate the possibility of this planet , and all the people on it , being annihilated by these horrendous weapons of mass destruction .

We also express our commitment to all the various tracks of the peace process without exception , with a view to guaranteeing Israel 's total withdrawal from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories , including the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Beka'a valley , and respect by Israel for international law and for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its rights to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State on its national territory , with Al-Quds as its capital .  
Given the limitations of tax administration systems in developing countries , the introduction of " objective income criteria " for the computation of taxable income , whereby taxable income is imputed on the basis of combined criteria , including , inter alia , the number of transactions , the total value of purchases and the size of the commercial unit , has proven to be effective in broadening the tax base with minimum political costs .  
Historical data on consumption of fuelwood are scarce but it is estimated that today some 1.8-billion-m3 , more than half of the total volume of wood produced , is consumed as fuel . 7 Fuelwood consumption is leading in some areas to deforestation , soil impoverishment and further hardship for the poor , who are dependent on the natural resource base for their day-to-day survival . 
Developing countries are concerned that private capital flows are concentrated in a few developing countries ( 12 countries accounted for about 80 per cent of total private flows and three quarters of FDI in developing countries during the first half of the 1990s ) , mostly middle-income countries in Asia ( which accounted for about two thirds of the expansion of total private flows ) and Latin America that have adopted outward-looking strategies and sound macroeconomic policies .

Since enrolment rates increased faster than population growth , the net enrolment ratios continued to rise in all developing regions .  
While noting the recent trends , including the decrease in the establishment of new peacekeeping operations , the total number of personnel involved in and the average size of operations , the Special Committee considers it essential for the United Nations to be able to continue to maintain international peace and security , in accordance with the Charter , inter alia , by effectively planning , deploying and managing current and future peacekeeping operations .

While it is estimated that only half of the total natural ( and semi-natural ) forest area is currently available for wood production as a consequence of economic and physical inaccessibility , there are no apparent constraints in production and consumption at the global level .  
Request countries , with the support of international organizations , particularly UNEP and the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) , to make a comprehensive assessment of the current status of protected forest areas , including total number , extent of each area , objectives of establishment , effectiveness of management , IUCN system equivalent category , and basic biological and social information available ; 
Recent statistics show that 12 countries , which owe about half the total third world external debt , are responsible for more than 70 per cent of global annual deforestation . 2 The debt burden provides an inducement to liquidate forest capital for much-needed foreign exchange .

" In the past , the focus of what scholars came in contact with in music was this type of political , ritual music .

" Sadly , the average person does n't know very much about this , " laments Nelson Yang . Because in the past mountain climbers or naturalists neglected the history of the opening and development of Taiwan 's mountain areas , people have focused only on the flatlands and shoreline that make up just one fourth of the total land area of the island .

With regard to the interim report on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions prepared by the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights ( A / 51 / 457 ) , he noted that the Special Rapporteur , in paragraph 99 of his report , emphasized that Governments must respect the right to life of all persons , even when they demonstrated total disregard for the lives of others .  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons , must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,  
Indonesia 's experience illustrated the region 's rapid transition from an economy where , just over a quarter of a century ago , 60 per cent of its population had been classified as poor to one where an annual average growth of 7 per cent had been sustained over two decades , and where the incidence of absolute poverty now affected less than 14 per cent of the total population .  
Notwithstanding the modest level of funding that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) has received for activities in this sector , the total collapse of the rural infrastructure , the destruction of irrigation systems and the presence of mines in prime agricultural land , WFP has had remarkable success in assisting in the relaunching of food production .  
Noting with very deep concern that the total economic blockade imposed against Burundi seriously penalizes the most vulnerable social groups , particularly the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons , the tens of thousands of returnees , the sick , women , children and the elderly ,  
Makes an impassioned appeal to the United Nations system and to intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to join in providing assistance to those segments of the population most gravely affected by the embargo and whose already grim economic , material and health conditions are being greatly exacerbated by the total blockade imposed against Burundi , namely , displaced persons , returnees , the sick , women , children and the elderly ;  
Although the final account on the construction at ESCAP was to have been submitted to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session , as reported in document A / C . 5 / 50 / 17 , it was expected that there would be additional charges against the project for minor retrofit of main vehicular entrance , final finishes and so on before the exact total project cost could be known .  
Noting with very deep concern that the total economic blockade imposed against Burundi seriously penalizes the most vulnerable social groups , particularly the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons , the tens of thousands of returnees , the sick , women , children and the elderly ,  
Makes an impassioned appeal to the United Nations system and to intergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian organizations to join in providing assistance to those segments of the population most gravely affected by the embargo and whose already grim economic , material and health conditions are being greatly exacerbated by the total blockade imposed against Burundi , namely , displaced persons , returnees , the sick , women , children and the elderly ;  
At its fifteenth session , the Committee , taking into account the criteria of preference to be given to those States parties whose reports had been pending for the longest time , the need to give priority to initial reports and the desirability of a balance of reports in terms of geographic and other factors , decided to consider at its sixteenth session a total of eight reports of States parties : four initial reports , two second periodic reports and two third periodic reports .  
At later stages of planning , the Secretariat will require more detailed information , such as the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number and types of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , and information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . , ammunition ) , and any specific handling instructions .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per annum during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
Upon enquiry , however , the Advisory Committee was informed that , based on past experience , it was expected that the actual ratio of recurrent administrative costs to the actual total pensionable remuneration would be in the neighbourhood of 0.18 per cent of the pensionable remuneration , in line with the provision estimated for administrative costs in the actuarial valuation of the Fund since the 1986 valuation .  
The fund was established with a base level of $ 20-million and may extend up to an amount equivalent to 10 per cent of the total budgetary estimates for voluntary repatriation for the preceding year .  
Costa Rica endeavoured to be a worthy representative of its Group in that most important organ and to advance the basic values of its own foreign policy : the promotion of human rights , respect for international humanitarian law , respect for the principle of non-intervention , total compliance with the prohibition of the use of force and the promotion of democracy as the ideal means of implementing the right of peoples to self-determination .  
Member States have an ongoing commitment to the principles of the United Nations Charter and the norms of international law , which are founded on total and mutual respect for the territorial integrity and political systems of other States and non-interference in their internal affairs ; the non-use of force ; and the peaceful settlement of conflicts through negotiations .  
For these reasons , Costa Rica supports the creation of a broad region called The nuclear-weapon-free Southern Hemisphere and adjacent areas on the basis of a proposal for resolutions put forward by Brazil , which should include a total ban on the transport and transfer of nuclear materials for bellicose purposes and of atomic waste .  
Regarding energy as a substantive topic , it was considered vital to take into account a number of pertinent issues , such as the uneven distribution of fuel and energy resources , the interactive management of energy , energy savings , the problems related to biomass sources from contaminated forests and the need for a total energy system , and the special needs of small island countries .  
In his introductory statement , the Deputy Secretary _ General of UNCTAD outlined the major global economic and technological changes that were occurring , and noted that although some developing countries were able to reap the benefits arising from those changes , others , especially the least developed countries , lacked the resource base and technological capability necessary to take advantage of the opportunities offered , and ran the risk of marginalization or even total exclusion .  
Emphasizes the right of children with disabilities to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and urges Governments to ensure the provision of equal access to comprehensive health services and the adoption of holistic approaches to the total well-being of all children with disabilities , particularly children at highest risk , including refugee , displaced or migrant children , children living in situations of violence and its immediate aftermath , children living in disaster areas , street children and children in squatter colonies ;  
When an exceptionally cold winter in the northern hemisphere raised demand , inventories were allowed to fall as the industry expected that Iraq would resume exporting oil under Security Council resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , in which the Council authorized States to permit the import of petroleum and petroleum products originating in Iraq , sufficient to produce a sum not exceeding a total of US $ 1-billion every 90 days .  
Recognizing that the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty and any proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices must constitute disarmament measures , and not only non-proliferation measures , and that these measures , together with an international legal instrument on adequate security assurances for non-nuclear-weapon States and an international convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons , must be integral steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework ,  
During the period under review , the special process received a total of 3,058 cases through non-governmental organizations and field offices , which were considered , processed and transmitted to the authorities allegedly held responsible .  
While the Tribunal conducts an exhumation at an alleged grave site only to obtain evidence in support of indictments , which might often be limited to a certain number of mortal remains , the expert aims at the total exhumation of a given site for the sole and purely humanitarian purpose of identifying as many missing persons as possible .  
Thus , whereas the annual growth rate of the international migrant stock in the developed countries increased only moderately , passing from 2.3 per cent per year during 1965-1975 to 2.4 per cent during 1985-1990 , that of the total number of migrants in the developing countries increased ninefold , rising from 0.3 per cent during 1965-1975 to 2.7 per cent during 1985-1990 .  
Although there are numerous examples of good practices by business and industry , the number of companies that are making strides in becoming sustainable development enterprises is small relative to the global total , a disappointing trend given that business and industry is the single most dominant factor influencing the direction of investments and financial flows , as well as the type of products produced and the processes with which they are made . 
Begin implementation of the rural development investment programme , paying special attention to areas where uprooted population groups are being resettled and areas where poverty is greatest , with emphasis on basic infrastructure ( main roads , rural roads , electricity , telecommunications , water and environmental sanitation ) and production projects , for a total of 300-million quetzales in 1997 .  
The Economic and Social Council , by its decision 1996 / 244 , decided that the Commission at its sixth session , in addition to plenary meetings , should be provided with full interpretation services for a total of 12 meetings for informal consultations on draft proposals and for meetings of open-ended working groups , the precise allocation of time for the different types of meetings to be determined by the Commission at its sixth session under item 2 of its agenda , entitled " Adoption of the agenda and organization of work " .  
Although dependence on imported oil and coal for total energy requirements is not expected to be reduced , natural gas is anticipated to have an increasing role in electricity production and in the residential heating market .  
Meanwhile , as is clear from the above , the international community of States has unequivocally admitted that the Abkhaz separatists are still pursuing " ethnic cleansing " by using the most barbaric methods in the territory under their control , leading to the massive destruction and forcible expulsion of the Georgian population , who had made up half the total population of Abkhazia before the conflict .  
The national communication includes aggregated emission estimates using global warming potentials ( GWP ) , with CO2 emissions contributing 80 per cent of total emissions expressed as CO2 equivalent , methane ( CH4 ) 12 per cent , nitrous oxide ( N2O ) 7 per cent and indirect GHG nitrogen oxides ( NOx ) ,  
As at 13 June , the cumulative total of arms and ammunition recovered and verified by military observers was 10,036 weapons and more than 1.24-million assorted pieces of ammunition , while approximately 3,750 weapons had been reported surrendered to ECOMOG outside the official disarmament sites .  
Emphasizes the right of children with disabilities to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and urges Governments to ensure the provision of equal access to comprehensive health services and the adoption of holistic approaches to the total well-being of all children with disabilities , particularly children at highest risk , including refugee , displaced or migrant children , children living in situations of violence and its immediate aftermath , children living in disaster areas , street children and children in squatter colonies ;  
It believed that the Secretary-General 's statement that it would be possible to absorb the additional cost of $ 2,841,300 gross within the total revised appropriation of $ 2,603,280,900 for the biennium 1996-1997 given the fact that the United States dollar had appreciated to a significant extent since December 1996 was premature , since it was impossible to make precise forecasts of currency movements in the last six months of 1997 . 
Eleven countries , under the leadership of Italy , declared their readiness to send a total of up to 7,200 troops to form a multinational protection force with the mission of facilitating the prompt and safe delivery of humanitarian assistance and of helping create the secure environment needed for the missions of international organizations in Albania , to provide humanitarian assistance and to help in monitoring elections .  
Also appeals to the international community to provide its material , technical and financial support to the non _ governmental organizations and to the groups that are working with dedication to achieve the total elimination of this cultural practice that is harmful for girl children and women ;  
Also appeals to the international community to provide its material , technical and financial support to the non _ governmental organizations and to the groups that are working with dedication to achieve the total elimination of this cultural practice that is harmful for girl children and women ;  
Recognizing the profound spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship that indigenous peoples have to their total environment and the urgent need to respect and recognize the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands , territories and resources ,  
That concern was evoked by the fact that the situation in the occupied territories was growing worse each day , as shown by the total blockade of the territories and the restrictions imposed on freedom of movement , which , in turn , had a catastrophic impact on the economic and social situation , health care , education and freedom of religion . 
Accordingly , Israel is unable , at this juncture , to commit itself to a total ban on the use of anti _ personnel landmines until effective alternative measures are available to ensure the protection of civilians threatened on a daily basis by terrorists , and to ensure the protection of Israeli defence forces operating in areas of armed conflict .  
After extensive consultations , the Minister for Foreign Affairs informed me that , since no additional resources had been authorized under resolution 1111 ( 1997 ) , the needs of vulnerable groups would be met outside the framework of the resolution .  I am glad to report that the United Nations has been creative in preparing the plan for the three northern governorates and was able to increase the resources for some key sectors through reallocations within the total amount of funds available .  
As indicated in the report of the Secretary-General on sources for the financing of development ( see A / 52 / 399 ) , there has been a shift in the composition of financial flows to developing countries from public to private sector sources , with the latter now accounting for an overwhelming share of the total ( albeit not for all individual countries ) .  This situation is unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future .  
Despite the adoption of the Paris Declaration and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s , [ 29 ] there has been a decline in real terms of total official development assistance for least developed countries and continued marginalization of those countries , and their number has increased from 41 to 48 without a proportionate increase in support measures despite national and international efforts .  
It is therefore our common task and responsibility to seize this historic opportunity , provided by the present international environment , to work together for the total elimination of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and for the regulation and control of other conventional tools of killing .  
Women workers are covered by social security , towards which the employer pays the equivalent of 10 per cent of her total monthly pay , while she pays 5 per cent to the social security fund as a guarantee for her future should she suffer an occupational disease or be incapacitated for work or retire from a government post .  
We have noted that the countries involved in the Ottawa process have , of their own free will , arrived at a Convention on the total ban of anti-personnel landmines , and we would like to express our respect for their choice , and our understanding for the humanitarian concern they have demonstrated . 
While no one can yet accurately estimate the total number of items at large or which areas are contaminated , historic estimates have assumed 3-million anti-personnel landmines , and recent government estimates suggest that as much as 13,000 square kilometres ( a quarter of the land surface of Croatia ) , are being treated as suspected mined areas . 
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
The Advisory Committee was informed that for 1996-1997 actual and projected assessments on Member States in respect of peacekeeping operations , excluding the costs for special missions covered under the regular budget , are expected to total $ 2.5-billion . 
The total for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997 was 7,793.14 The Committee was informed that this total included posts for support services and substantive activities ( including posts financed from operational funds posted at established United Nations offices and posts financed from the support account for peacekeeping operations ) .  
Even though the total number of peacekeeping operations and their average size have been reduced in recent years , peacekeeping is still the key instrument available to the United Nations in discharging its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
Albania has a peculiar history of chronic isolation , of almost total estrangement from the rest of the world , of great potential , human and natural wealth , while being , at the same time , underdeveloped and poor .  Our difficulties of growth are directly linked to the legacies of former rules and half a century of communism , of non-existent , non-functioning or malfunctioning democratic institutions , both during and after the collapse of communism and its structures , as well as with our mentality .  
However , in spite of some positive developments in the area of arms regulation and disarmament in the past year , we can not be too sanguine about these achievements in the absence of any real or substantial progress made in the area of the further reduction of nuclear weapons leading to their total elimination .  
It was a positive contribution by the Court to the realization of the goal of total elimination of nuclear weapons , which must be pursued by the international community if we are to eliminate the possibility of this planet , and all the people on it , being annihilated by these horrendous weapons of mass destruction .  
Accordingly , Israel is unable at this juncture to commit itself to a total ban on the use of anti-personnel landmines until effective alternative measures are available to ensure the protection of civilians threatened on a daily basis by terrorists and of Israeli Defence Forces operating in areas of armed conflict .  
This initiative proposes that the Conference on Disarmament negotiate a multilateral instrument committing all States to the objective of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons ; an agreement on the steps required in a phased programme with deadlines leading to their total elimination ; and a convention prohibiting the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and other explosive nuclear devices .  
In conclusion , my delegation takes this opportunity to strongly reaffirm Malaysia 's well-known position of total commitment and unwavering support for , and abiding solidarity with , the Palestinian people in their valiant struggle for a just and lasting peace and for an independent sovereign state of Palestine , with Jerusalem , the sacred city of Muslims , Christians and Jews , as its capital . 
We also express our commitment to all the various tracks of the peace process without exception , with a view to guaranteeing Israel 's total withdrawal from all occupied Arab and Palestinian territories , including the Syrian Golan , southern Lebanon and the Beka'a valley , and respect by Israel for international law and for the legitimate national rights of the Palestinian people , including its rights to self-determination and to the establishment of an independent State on its national territory , with Al-Quds as its capital .  
Given the limitations of tax administration systems in developing countries , the introduction of " objective income criteria " for the computation of taxable income , whereby taxable income is imputed on the basis of combined criteria , including , inter alia , the number of transactions , the total value of purchases and the size of the commercial unit , has proven to be effective in broadening the tax base with minimum political costs .  
Historical data on consumption of fuelwood are scarce but it is estimated that today some 1.8-billion-m3 , more than half of the total volume of wood produced , is consumed as fuel . 7 Fuelwood consumption is leading in some areas to deforestation , soil impoverishment and further hardship for the poor , who are dependent on the natural resource base for their day-to-day survival . 
Developing countries are concerned that private capital flows are concentrated in a few developing countries ( 12 countries accounted for about 80 per cent of total private flows and three quarters of FDI in developing countries during the first half of the 1990s ) , mostly middle-income countries in Asia ( which accounted for about two thirds of the expansion of total private flows ) and Latin America that have adopted outward-looking strategies and sound macroeconomic policies .  
The coalition 's basic aims are : general amnesty for political prisoners ; total respect for the laws in force ; fulfilment by the Government of its international human rights commitments ; adoption by the Government of the measures required to establish a system of free employment and free enterprise ; and free and direct elections .  
The international community as a whole has taken a stand on this subject , in a virtually consensual manner , in endorsing the objective of a total ban on anti _ personnel mines by a very large majority with no negative votes in United Nations General Assembly resolution 51 / 45 L . As you know , France supported that text . 
He has expressed regret that agreements reached without the participation of the people might postpone the transition to 1997 ; he has pointed out that confidence in the political classes has been lost because of their failure to implement the directives of CNS and that , during the first 8 months _ out of a total of 24 _ of the extended period , only one of the prior requirements for elections has been satisfied , namely , approval of the Law on the establishment of CNE in an atmosphere of complete national indifference . 
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
UNIFIL has completed a full review of the damages resulting from the incident that occurred at Qana and the surrounding area on 18 April 1996 and identified the total costs directly attributable to the incident at $ 893,319 , comprising $ 552,474 in damages to the headquarters compound of the Fijian battalion and $ 340,845 in damages sustained in other surrounding positions in the UNIFIL area of operations .  
There is a strong tide of international opinion _ which New Zealand supports vigorously _ that rejects the military use of these most indiscriminate weapons when set against the deadly toll extracted on innocent civilians , as well as the economic and developmental loss in countries already devastated by war , and concludes that only a total ban is an acceptable goal .  
Emphasizes the right of children with disabilities to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standards of physical , psychological and mental health , and urges Governments to guarantee this through free access to health services and the adoption of holistic approaches towards the total well-being of disabled children , which should include :  
It is therefore clear that if there is to be genuine improvement in the disturbing situation in the former Sectors , efforts by both international and local organizations to promote confidence and reconciliation will continue to be needed for the foreseeable future .  1 International observers had estimated the total number of killings which had taken place in the former Sectors in circumstances unrelated to the military actions of August 1995 to be at least 120 ( see S / 1995 / 1051 ) .  
Contributing to the total additional requirements of $ 162,600 under the meal and accommodation budget line item were daily subsistence allowance payments to military contingent personnel ( $ 16,700 ) recorded in part , under this budget line item ( see para . 10 below ) , and charges for meal allowance paid in the preceding mandate period ( $ 48,600 ) .  
On the multilateral level , Austria is a staunch supporter of the efforts to complete as soon as possible an effective , legally binding international agreement on a total ban of anti-personnel landmines .  
Of the total cost estimates contained in the report , 59 per cent are based on standard costs and ratios , while the remaining 41 per cent cover mission - specific requirements ; non-recurrent costs amount to $ 2,517,000 gross , while recurrent costs amount to $ 29,851,000 gross .  
For the three years 1993-1995 , total equity investment flows , including quasi-equities like convertible bonds and bonds with equity warrants , were equivalent to nearly half the FDI flows to developing countries and countries in transition [ 1 ] .  The surge in equity investment in emerging markets took place against a background of structural changes in international capital markets and in the economies of recipient countries .  
The Advisory Committee requested additional information on the proposed requirements of $ 1.1-million for claims and adjustments under budget line 10 , " Supplies and services " , and was informed that the requirements were estimated at the same monthly rate ( $ 91,000 ) as in the initial cost estimates contained in document A / 50 / 696 / Add . 4 and that , as at 2 April 1997 , a total of 78 third-party liability claims amounting to $ 400,000 had been received by UNTAES .  
In 1996 , 58 per cent - or $ 551-million of total income - was received as general resources which UNICEF allocated to Board approved programmes supporting children and women , guided by a needs-based formula ( size of child population , under-five mortality rate , per capita gross national product ( GNP ) ) .  
Thus , it supported General Assembly resolution 51 / 45 S , a logical stance fully consistent with the joint action of the European Union , which is committed to the goal of the total elimination of anti _ personnel landmines and shall work actively towards the achievement at the earliest possible date of an effective international agreement to ban these weapons worldwide .  
Fostering an enabling environment for development implies a concerted effort by Governments at the national and international levels , in collaboration with other actors in development , to ensure that the interplay among those policies , measures and institutions and the sum total of their impact promotes not only sustained economic growth but a development style that is sustainable and broad-based and whose benefits are shared equitably by all members of society .  
In view of the experience gained during the events of August 1996 and the subsequent prolonged state of alert , I have requested the contributors of infantry units to increase their strength by a total of 63 personnel all ranks , bringing UNFICYP 's strength to its authorized level .  28 .  Mr . Han Sung-Joo requested that his appointment as my Special Representative for Cyprus not be extended beyond its expiration in April 1997 .  
All of the major developing regions of the world registered significant increases in primary school enrolments , with the combined total reaching some 545-million in 1995 , representing an increase of nearly 50-million in five years , double the pace of expansion during the 1980s .  Since enrolment rates increased faster than population growth , the net enrolment ratios continued to rise in all developing regions .  
While noting the recent trends , including the decrease in the establishment of new peacekeeping operations , the total number of personnel involved in and the average size of operations , the Special Committee considers it essential for the United Nations to be able to continue to maintain international peace and security , in accordance with the Charter , inter alia , by effectively planning , deploying and managing current and future peacekeeping operations .  
On the multilateral level , Austria is a staunch supporter of the efforts to complete as soon as possible an effective , legally binding international agreement on a total ban of anti-personnel landmines .  
Recognizing the profound spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship that indigenous peoples have to their total environment and the urgent need to respect and recognize the rights of indigenous peoples to their lands , territories and resources ,  
They had also pointed out that total compliance with the principle of shared responsibility ought produce more concrete results and a global and balanced view of the drugs problem which would facilitate the coordination of activities at the national , regional and world level in conformity with the principles of international law .  
The Programme believed that the international capital markets and the private sector played a vital role in the promotion of sustainable energy concepts , since total private sector investments in energy far outweighed all flows of official development assistance to the sector .  
As a sign of Sweden 's continuing commitment to the work of the United Nations in the economic and social fields , the Swedish Government in its budget bill to the Parliament for 1997 - in spite of cuts in almost all other areas of government expenditure - was proposing a maintained total level of voluntary contributions to the Organization 's operational activities .  
The fund was established with a base level of $ 20-million and may extend up to an amount equivalent to 10 per cent of the total budgetary estimates for voluntary repatriation for the preceding year .  
The effects of global warming are of grave concern to small islands like ours , whose coastal areas may become submerged , and whose protective coral reefs are at risk of total destruction .  
A universal and legally binding multilateral agreement , committed to the objective of total elimination of nuclear weapons , could be taken up , as also the convention on the prohibition of the production of fissile material .  
The statement in the World Drug Report that the trade in illicit drugs represented approximately 8 per cent of total international trade and constituted one of the most profitable ways of becoming wealthy , was alarming .  
Under the original proposal for the forthcoming biennium , the total number of posts would be reduced from 10,012 , the number approved for the current biennium , to 8,839 , and that number might be as low as 8,695 if Member States accepted the proposed reforms .  
While voluntary contributions continued to be sought for the RDMHQ , the contributions received so far fell far short of the total of nearly $ 3.2-million that had been identified as necessary for the first two years of the RDMHQ .  
While the report attempted to reflect the total requirements of human and financial resources from all sources , it ought to have been more focused and analytical , and the assertions it contained were not supported by convincing analysis .  
The fund was established with a base level of $ 20-million and may extend up to an amount equivalent to 10 per cent of the total budgetary estimates for voluntary repatriation for the preceding year .  
Recognizing the profound spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship that indigenous people have to their total environment and the urgent need to respect and recognize the rights of indigenous people to their lands , territories and resources ,  
Recognizing the profound spiritual , cultural , social and economic relationship that indigenous people have to their total environment and the urgent need to respect and recognize the rights of indigenous people to their lands , territories and resources ,  
The rise in social spending has encouraged public investment , which increased in 1997 to a level equivalent to 4 per cent of gross domestic product ( GDP ) , which in turn had a positive multiplier effect on other economic activities and on total employment .  
A long-standing request for an additional airport permit , required to collect the diplomatic pouch , was granted to an international driver during the reporting period , bringing the total of such permits held to two .  
It tries to make the discussions at the fissile material negotiations , to take place in Geneva , more meaningful and more fruitful , eventually leading , I hope soon , to a complete , effective , integrated system based on the total elimination of nuclear weapons .  
It was projected that at the end of 1998 , combined cash would total $ 528-million , based on regular budget cash of negative $ 247-million and peacekeeping positive balances of $ 775-million .  
At the end of 1997 , the total external debt of all the developing countries and economies in transition had increased by 4 per cent compared with 1996 , and the tremendous efforts made by the developing countries to improve their performance had not been matched by international initiatives for debt reduction at the international level .  
While it is estimated that only half of the total natural ( and semi-natural ) forest area is currently available for wood production as a consequence of economic and physical inaccessibility , there are no apparent constraints in production and consumption at the global level .  
Request countries , with the support of international organizations , particularly UNEP and the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) , to make a comprehensive assessment of the current status of protected forest areas , including total number , extent of each area , objectives of establishment , effectiveness of management , IUCN system equivalent category , and basic biological and social information available ; 
Recent statistics show that 12 countries , which owe about half the total third world external debt , are responsible for more than 70 per cent of global annual deforestation . 2 The debt burden provides an inducement to liquidate forest capital for much-needed foreign exchange . 
Out of a total quantity of fissile material of weapons _ grade quality , which is estimated at roughly 2,000 tons , almost 1,400 tons constitute so _ called transitional material , in other words , declared or undeclared excess material .  
The Greek Cypriot administration , which tries to present itself as the champion of conservation of cultural heritage , continues , on the one hand , to show utter contempt for what is left of the Turkish-Islamic heritage in South Cyprus , where Ottoman Turkish shrines are under threat of disintegration due to total neglect , and , on the other hand , systematically blocks the flow of any external financial or technical assistance to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus for conservation purposes .  
It was also important to find new ways of gauging international economic performance , not only by using formal economic indicators but also by measuring the informal and even the illegal economy in order to have a true measure of the global , or total , economy .  
The requisite intent has support in direct and indirect evidence , including Khmer Rouge statements , eyewitness accounts and the nature and number of victims in each group , both in absolute terms and in proportion to each group 's total population . 12 These groups qualify as protected groups under the Convention : the Muslim Cham as an ethnic and religious group ; the Vietnamese communities as an ethnic and , perhaps , a racial group ; and the Buddhist monkhood as a religious group . 
Finally , in the smaller translation and editorial units at the United Nations Office at Nairobi and the regional commissions , the total absence of posts at the P-5 level , except those occupied by managers overseeing all conference services at those duty stations , means that all prospects of advancement to the P-5 level of any translator or editor , however competent , is contingent on a transfer to one of the three larger conference centres .
