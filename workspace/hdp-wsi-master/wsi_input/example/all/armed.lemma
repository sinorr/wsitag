It is reported that the two ethnic groups living in the Ituri region , Hema and Lendu , have been in rivalry for a long time , fighting for land resources and the like .  In recent months , there have been continuous mass armed clashes , causing tremendous casulty and losses .  
At the same time the new Russian military doctrine has conferred on the Russian armed forces the functions of defending the state constitution , and striking at the illegal activities of extremist organizations , organized crime , and terrorism ; the original military doctrine laid down that such tasks should be undertaken by Interior Ministry troops .  
The party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core has held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , unswervingly upheld the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and persistently put ideological and political building in the most important place .  The people 's armed forces have maintained their brilliant image of being mighty and civilized armed forces .  The armed forces are constantly scoring new victories in making themselves more revolutionary , modern and regular .  
This is a valuable conclusion drawn from the experience in the practice of the modernization of our armed forces for several decades , and is the correct choice for speeding up the process of making our armed forces more revolutionary , modern and regular .  
The important speech given by President Jiang at the Plenary Session of the PLA Representative Troops fully affirms the achievements made by the military and armed police troops and raises clear requirements for comprehensively promoting the construction of military modernization .  The speech emphasizes that the military must further clearly understand the historical mission it shoulders and provide firm and strong assurance of security for protecting the country 's sovereignty , unity and security , for protecting the people 's labor under peaceful conditions and for reform , opening up and the construction of socialist modernization .  
The circular urges the officers and men of the entire army and the armed police force to unite more closely round the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , work hard , pioneer the way forward , and usher in the new century with a brand-new outlook and outstanding achievements .  
The PLA and armed police units are treating the campaign of learning from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun as an important content of their ideological and political education , organizing the officers and men to learn from the advanced deeds of Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun in light of the realities of army building in the new period , and help the officers and men further their understanding of Lei Feng 's and Li Xiangqun 's lofty spirit .  
The PLA and armed police units are treating efforts to strengthen the ideological properties of young officers and men as the most important part of the campaign of learning from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun ; and are guiding young officers and men to display a " spirit of the nail " [ grasping every available minute and second ] , painstakingly study Deng Xiaoping Theory and materialist dialectics , constantly lay a solid ideological theory foundation , and acquire correct world outlook , outlook on life , and values .  
Sun Yuxi answered that last year , the US-led NATO used force against Yugoslavia , a sovereign country , using the Kosovo issue as an excuse .  This seriously violated the UN Charter and norms governing international relations and set an extremely dangerous precedent of armed intervention in the internal affairs of another country .  
Defense ministers of the five countries exchanged views on the issues of implementing the consensus reached by heads of the five countries , summarizing the situation in executing the agreements on confidence-building in the military sphere and on the mutual reduction of the armed forces in the border areas , strengthening the trustful cooperation in military , political , and security spheres among the five countries , and opposing the national separatism , the religious extremism , and the international terrorism .  After reaching a broad agreement on these issues , they issued a joint communique .  
Adhering to the guiding principle that focuses on unity , stability , inspiration , and positive propaganda , we had a good grasp of the press , broadcast , movie , and television work , armed people 's minds with scientific theory , guided people with correct public opinion , molded people with lofty spirits , and encouraged people with fine artistic works .  
On the basis of its geopolitics and its domestic and foreign " realistic " situation , Russia has gradually formed its own unique " practical containment " nuclear strategy : to prevent the outbreak of a nuclear war and a large-scale conventional war by means of nuclear deterrence and to first use nuclear weapons in a regional war , local war or armed conflict to attain the goal of safeguarding national security and maintaining the status of a big country .  
While urging the international community to exchange experiences , both positive and negative , in promoting and protecting the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups in accordance with the principle of equal treatment , sincere cooperation , and mutual respects , China opposes the practice of exercising armed intervention against other countries by using the nationality issue as a pretext and relying on military superiority and also resolutely opposes the act of carrying out separatist activities under the pretense of safeguarding the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups . 
After the Cold War , peace and development have become major topics that are of common concern to peoples of all nations in the world .  In this situation , Japan has not made more contributions to world peace and development , but has instead used all its armed might to indulge in wars of aggression , expanded its armament without restraint , and attempted to elevate its international status and political and economic interests as a military power .  This obviously runs counter to the historical trend .  
Our military 's scientific and technical strength lags fairly far behind that of the western armed forces , therefore , the scientific and technological resources in the masses of people will be the essential supplement and effective support for our military to win a victory under inferior conditions during a high-tech war .  
Last year , in light of their combat tasks , they again explored such new topics as single-soldier air defense missiles fighting against armed helicopters and tackled bottlenecks in this regard together with an antiaircraft artillery unit .  In light of such characteristics of an armed helicopter as being capable of hovering for a shorter period of time , launching a rapid attack , and so on , they also studied and developed new tactics like continuous shelling , striking specified points , surrounding and annihilating , and so on .  
Leading cadres should use the important concept of " three represents " as a sharp weapon to observe and ponder problems , as the basic criterion for telling right from wrong , and as the basis for making decisions in work ; only thus will they be able to remain sober and steadfast politically , to stand up to various new tests , and to ensure stability and a high degree of centralization and unification in the armed forces and the party 's absolute leadership over them .  
In the face of the " Taiwan independence " forces that are running wild and an adverse international current against China in particular , we must pay close attention to making preparations for a military struggle , keep increasing our defense capacity , do our utmost to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland and to safeguard our state sovereignty and the interests of the people , and ensure that our armed forces are capable of fighting and winning when the motherland and the people need them .  
Around the two historic questions of how to " fight and win " and how one does " not become degenerate , " we now should emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , smash the trammels of outmoded ideas and the old way of thinking , earnestly study new situations and problems , and explore new ideas , new methods , and new ways to solve major practical problems in the armed forces in order to keep raising the level of army building .  
Leading cadres must do a good job in arming themselves with scientific theories and the knowledge of science and technology , keep improving themselves ideologically and theoretically , and increase their ability to lead the effort to strengthen the armed forces through science and technology and to direct modern warfare in order to keep pace with the times and to adapt themselves to social , economic , and cultural development , to the renewal of weapons and equipment , and to the change of modern warfare .  
We must regard the study and implementation of this important thinking a fundamental approach to and a long-term strategic mission for enhancing party organizations ' cohesion and combat strength , for ensuring the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and for accomplishing the two historical tasks of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration . "  We must make unremitting efforts to study and implement this important thinking so as to improve party building in the armed forces and raise the standards of military construction in all areas .  
In the course of studying the " three represents , " party committees of the armed forces and armed police units at and above the army level felt that party committees and leading cadres not only should act as model practitioners of the " three represents " but they should also shoulder the responsibility of guiding the party committees of subordinate military units in meeting the " three represents " requirements and advance party building in the military units in an all-round way .  
Against such a backdrop , we should give full play to the armed forces ' fine traditions and encourage team efforts to solve problems together .  To achieve research breakthroughs , we should form many cooperative collectives with top-notched scientists as the cores .  This means that we should choose a large number of authoritative , reputable , innovative scientists with supervisory ability to head these collectives and organize and coordinate all quarters to tackle difficult technological issues and carry out large , strategic , frontline , and exploratory projects .  
He stressed the need to reinforce the building of party branches according to the " three represents " requirements , and the fundamental key lies in properly performing the function of exercising political leadership , thus guaranteeing the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces and guaranteeing the fulfillment of all tasks with medical service as the central link .  
Taiwan 's armed forces believe that they are bound to lose in any " decisive battle on their beaches and shores " because Taiwan Island is small , shallow in strategic depth , and lacking a room for maneuver , and with the development of modern weaponry , the Taiwan Strait is becoming less and less effective as a natural defense for Taiwan .  
The core of Taiwan armed forces ' thinking of " decisive battle outside border " is : They will offer tenacious resistance on offshore islands , make timely landing raids on enemy shores , take advantage of the advanced performance of their main naval and air weapons to first impose war on the enemy , let war start on the enemy 's shore , and prevent war from reaching their own " doorstep " .  
Firepower warfare has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  As people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have been added to firepower warfare .  The long-range , accurate , highly efficient , and rapid reaction natures of firepower call for profound changes in the military 's principles and types and methods of fighting , and also set new tests and demands on a country 's war preparations and building of armed forces .  
Therefore , the unit , relying on its own efforts in the face of these difficulties , took the initiative in carrying out coordinated training with a transportation regiment of the military region , a helicopter wing , and a naval test base under the support of the military region 's relevant department .  For the first time in the entire armed forces , it conducted a long-distance three-dimensional maneuver for its troops by four transportation methods - - " sea routes , air links , railways , and highways " .  The maneuver was a success .  
Only by paying close attention to building a contingent of qualified personal as a fundamental task will it be possible for us to implement the grand strategy of strengthening our armed forces through science and technology .  
Meanwhile , military lawyers , as political workers , should consider the ultimate goal of their legal services as one of serving the armed forces ' political and ideological construction and increasing the relevancy and effectiveness of ideological and political work in the new period while performing their professional duties .  
Like their civilian counterparts , the legal affairs that military lawyers have to handle involve those relevant to criminal , civil , economic , administrative , maritime , and financial laws , and so they must be totally familiar with the laws and regulations of the country so that they can properly handle the legal affairs in the armed forces and legal affairs that involve both military and civilian departments ;  
In an area where there were high mountains , steep cliffs , long and deep valleys , thick bushes , and ferocious animals , a " special assault group " was faced with a ruthless battle : It had to accurately find a way out by crossing through a primeval forest as deep as 35 kilometers in the pitch-black night within 11 hours without being discovered by the " enemy " forces , who were armed with all types of modern reconnaissance equipment . 
Sometimes maybe only units of a certain armed service are needed , but usually combined forces including active units and reserve forces are needed " .  " In the meantime , the skills and resources provided by multinational forces , regional organizations , international bodies , non-government organizations , voluntary organizations , and private organizations should be adequately made use of , if possible " , to ensure that the US army 's " non-war military operation " will achieve the intended objective .  
Due to people 's being tired of and paying less attention to the conventional battle with firepower , confusion has emerged in military theory and the study of military theory on fighting with firepower has seriously lagged behind .  The situation will influence our judgment and selection in the types of a future war and affect our understanding and policy-making in the structure and building of the armed forces .  
Fighting with firepower has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  When people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have added to fighting with firepower .  The long-range , accurate , highly efficient and rapid reaction natures of firepower call for profound changes in the military 's principle , types and methods of fighting , and also set new tests and demands on a country 's war preparations and building of armed forces .  
This successful exercise , with a landing operation as its backdrop , has showed clearly that the multidimensional combat ability of our army is being enhanced today , as it not only has the means to cope with hard offensives launched by the enemy with such high-tech weapons as cruise missile and armed helicopter ; but also has the right measures to counter soft assaults , such as network attacks , which base on high technologies means .  
Under the new international and internal situations , whether or not the Chinese armed forces can keep pace with the military developments in various parts of the world , can win the high-tech wars that might occur in the future , and maintain the character , true color and work style of the people 's armed forces rest primarily with the construction of party organizations in the armed forces ; and also with the mental state , work style , discipline , organization , fighting capabilities and leadership of party organizations in the armed forces .  
Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the Chinese armed forces ' guiding thought for construction underwent a strategic change .  We have reduced the number of personnel , substantially restructured our sizes , drawn up a strategic policy for military affairs in the new period , and achieved the " two fundamental changes " .  The successes we have achieved have attracted worldwide attention .  
During the process of deepening reforms , we must not waver in upholding all the basic rules governing the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces - - such as the rules on the division of military leaders ' responsibilities and the establishment of political leaders and political bodies in the armed forces - - or rules that the supreme leadership and commanding authority belong to the collective leadership of the party Central Committee , the Central Military Commission , and party committees ( party branches ) .  
It is party leaders who drew up the armed forces ' laws and regulations .  They have shaped and standardized the party 's basic principles for the construction of the armed forces , elevated these principles to the level where they become the will of the state , and used mandatory authority to ensure their implementation .  This is specifically an expression of consolidating and strengthening the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces .  
We should focus on current work assignment and future development all at the same time .  We should ensure that our military talents are equipped with one specialty and many supporting skills and that they are capable of performing alternative work assignments and have a basis for future development .  While focusing on cultivating military talents by using all the facilities and resources the armed forces have , we should also be good at encouraging other sectors to run institutions of higher learning .  
Various logistical supports have also been strengthened .  At present , our reserve forces ' rapid mobilization capability and fighting ability have been greatly improved .  Reserve forces have become a strong contingent of the armed forces of our country .  
have transformed our field equipment support , supply , and maintenance structure from one for ensuring separate support , supply , and maintenance for three armed services or different departments respectively into an integrated structure for ensuring support , supply , and maintenance for three armed services at the same time , which is capable of providing joint and regional support for three armed services ; handling repairs at a base ; and ensuring follow-up emergency repairs .  
It has made one innovation after another and has developed " tools for cooking and distributing hot foods " , " water filters for camp and field training " , " mobile barracks on vehicles " , and " oil heaters for cold areas on plateaus " .  It has laid a solid foundation for solving difficult problems that restrain long distance mobile support for the armed forces .  
The regulations fullyreflect the great importance that the CMC and headquarters have attached to the development of military colleges , and their concern and care for their teaching staff .  The regulations certainly will play a positive part in enabling the armed forces to bring in outstanding personnel , retaining the mainstay teachers , stabilizing their ranks , and improving the system of establishing specialized and technical positions , and strengthening college construction in all respects .  
seriously implement the general requirements that all army units must be qualified politically and competent militarily and must have a fine style of work , maintain strict discipline and be assured of adequate logistical support , and comprehensively promote army building ; resolutely abandon formalism and bureaucracy , make great efforts to encourage the style of seeking truth , doing solid work and going deep into reality , properly grasp all aspects of work , and constantly raise the revolutionization , modernization , and regularization of the armed forces to a new level .  
Internationally speaking , the trend of multi-polarization keeps developing , and the world situation generally tends to relax .  However , the world is not peaceful , as the superpower is still pursuing hegemonism , propagating such absurd views as " human rights overriding sovereignty " and " legitimate humanitarian intervention " , or even resorting to armed aggression and expansion .  
They should learn their lofty passion of fighting for the motherland , their fighting will for struggling persistently and their spiritual attainment of continuous pursuit .  Officers and soldiers throughout the military and the armed police forces should , as the athletes have done , work hard in training , make unswerving efforts , be brave in struggling for " gold medals " in their own posts , and accomplish more magnificent achievements for the People 's Republic of China .  
To meet the requirement for " being armed in two aspects " , members of party committees at all levels have continuously intensified their study .  However , in both the range and quality of their study and the conversion and application of the study results , they still fall short of the demand for " winning the war " .  More conspicuous are the inadequate study of military theories and military high-tech knowledge and the lack of versatile personnel .  
The long-standing logistics support pattern , under which the three armed forces had their individual systems and under which barriers existed between different departments and between different regions , was replaced by a joint logistics system , with military regions serving as a foundation .  As a result , logistics support has been put in place in a timely manner , supplies have never been suspended , none have ever been left out or under-supplied , and logistics resources have been reasonably distributed and effectively utilized .  
In 1950-1954 , armaments good for equipping 22 aviation divisions and 64 infantry divisions were purchased from the Soviet Union , with much of the purchased armaments reaching advanced international standards of that time , resulting in an tremendous improvement in the backward state of our armed forces ' armaments and thus laying a solid material foundation for prevailing in the war .  
Early in the War to Resist the United States and Help Korea , suddenly arriving new armaments were strange to many officers and soldiers because officers and soldiers of our armed forces had rather low scientific and educational levels and had all along used rather crude armaments during long years of domestic war .  Thus , in the second campaign , over 2,000 captured automobiles were destroyed by bombings executed by US armed forces because basically no one was able to drive an automobile to a place under cover .  
With the growing high-tech content in modern armaments , there are increasingly high requirements on our armed forces ' officers and soldiers in connection with scientific and cultural knowledge and military technological qualities .  
Therefore , we must scientifically design and plan the work of personnel training in a strategic manner , on the basis of the conditions of our country and our armed forces and objective requirements of future warfare , in an effort to substantially improve the quality of our armed forces ' military personnel quickly and to develop large numbers of high-quality military personnel ready to be used at critical moments .  
The great development of the industrial revolution early in this century made the organization of the military move away from the traditional model of having the infantry ( cavalry ) forces as the dominant forces , with the structure of the military coming to encompass such elements as artillery , armed , engineering , air defense , and naval forces ; the availability and quantities of the new services and arms of the military , characterized by high technological contents , became important indicators of the level of modernization and combat effectiveness of the military .  
Before joining the war in Korea , our armed forces already had artillery , armored , and engineering units , but such units accounted for an extremely small portion of the military as a whole , with the force structure model based on the dominant position of infantry forces remaining unchanged .  
It was because of the recognition of this point that the CPC Central Committee and Central Military Commission timely showed their determination , organizing and strengthening air force , naval and technical army units on the basis of carrying out fighting and force construction simultaneously , and thus achieved the change from a undiversified military into a composite military , thereby greatly improving our armed forces ' force structure and capability for coordinated operations and providing the equipment and technological foundation for prevailing over a strong enemy .  
On this happy occasion , we would like to extend our warm congratulations and cordial greetings to cadres and people of all nationalities and patriotic people from all social sectors of Qamdo and officers and men of the troops of the Chinese People 's Liberation Army , armed police , and public security troops stationed in Qamdo and our to all revolutionaries of the older generation and retiring comrades who had contributed to the stability and development of Qamdo .  
Faced with the most vicious aggressors who were armed to the teeth and under the circumstances of fighting an extremely brutal war , the officers and men of our army fought in a dauntless-heroism spirit of conquering all enemy and all difficulties .  They crossed ice-covered lands , slept on snow-covered areas , fought a bloody battle , and smashed the myth that the US army was unconquerable .  
All level of party organizations of the armed forces brought into play their roles as the core of leadership and fighting bastions while the broad masses of communist party members acted as exemplary vanguards .  Through forceful ideological and political work , these party organizations imbued all commanders and fighters with party policy decisions and instructions .  
Reporters learned from relevant departments of the General Staff Headquarterstoday that following the construction and development in the past half a century , our armed forces have bid farewell to the era of spreading antidotes by hand and using antidote carts drawn by horses , and have established over 100 systems of modern anti-chemical warfare equipment under nine major series , including the poison-detecting , anti-toxin , cleaning , smoke-generating , and flame-throwing systems .  
In order to develop the capacity for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , an anti-chemical warfare corps school was set up 50 years ago to train anti-chemical warfare cadres for the armed forces .  This raised the curtain of the building of the anti-chemical warfare corps in New China . In the past 50 years , our armed forces have organized troops with a relatively high quality to deal with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
At present , the equipment of our armed forces for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons has the technical means to reconnoiter and monitor attacks by all kinds of nuclear and chemical weapons and to give alarm .  Such equipment also includes advanced equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons , which is based on modern analysis and testing technology , detecting and alarming technology , and digital telecommunications technology , and is represented by armored anti-chemical reconnaissance vehicles .  
Serial equipment and complete sets of equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons in field operation can dash about in toxic and contaminated areas under all circumstances .  This has provided a firm material basis for increasing the capacity of our armed forces for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
The promulgation of the " Regulations on the Operation of the Anti-chemical Warfare Corps " of the new generation marked an important breakthrough made by our armed forces in their research on the characteristics and objective laws of operation under the threats of nuclear and chemical weapons , and marked a change from emphasizing protection on the same plane in the combined operation of the ground force to three-dimension protection in the joint operation of different armed services .  
With the efforts made in the past years , a system for training a new type of anti-chemical-warfare capable personnel has been formed in our armed forces .  At present , major combat equipment , including tanks , airplanes and vessels can better resist nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , and both the armed forces and the civilian basically have complete sets of equipment for protection against such weapons .  
During the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea in the early 1950s , Chinese military personnel had to fight against poison gas .  To meet the need of such an extremely severe situation , China 's anti-chemical scientific research institute , which was still being organized and established then , urgently began to develop the most needed poison-detecting equipment .  The curtain was then raised on the development of anti-chemical equipment for our armed forces .  
Our military personnel also had to rely on domestically made gas masks .  As far as this aspect is concerned , our armed forces now have a series of advanced protective equipment , which is suitable to the physiological feature of all ethnic groups in China and which meets various operational needs .  In addition , China also has a group of world-renowned experts on poison protection .  
The whole military and armed police forces have meticulously been carrying out and implementing Chairman Jiang 's " five-sentence " general requirement , and grassroots construction has been consistently strengthened and developed in a healthy manner of comprehensive progress and overall improvement .  From this implementation and construction have emerged a large number of advanced examples with outstanding achievements and moving deeds .  
In the 1990 ' s , after the end of the cold war , under international disarmament pressure and opposition from peace forces in Japan , Japan instituted the guideline of " reducing armaments on the one hand while improving the quality on the other " in its military building , and worked to build modern armed forces of " the right scale and ample quality . "  
At all times and in all situations , the banner of the Party should treated as the one banner , initiative must be taken in assuming the task of carrying out the Party 's Central Committee 's and Military Commission 's instructions and directives , a perfect mastery of the political issues in the General Political Department and units directly under its supervision is ensured , and a correct line of guidance for political work of the armed forces is ensured .  
It has also listed " enlisting graduates from an ordinary higher learning institution for military service " as a principal channel for recruiting officers and has further clarified or standardized the two other channels for recruiting officers , namely , " appointing office cadres as officers " and " recruiting professional , technological , or other types of personnel from outside the armed forces as officers . "  
At the same time , however , Russia emphasizes that it attaches greater importance to the development of conventional forces , and makes efforts to enhance its conventional combat capability in dealing with regional armed conflicts and partial wars , so as to be able to more effectively counter real threats of various kinds , especially ethnic splittist forces and separatist activities .  
absorbed experiences of success in the reform of the state personnel system and Army cadre system in recent years ; drew on the beneficial practices of foreign armed forces ; and adjusted and reformed the existing system of officers ' service , in a bid to make all the relevant systems better suited to the development of the situation and the times .  
The US military 's joint training is guided by national security strategy and military strategy and based on joint operations theory ; it strives to gradually make the armed forces into a flexible integrated joint force through carrying out joint training based on requirements , to facilitate the completion of multinational , joint , and multi-institutional missions in wartime or non-wartime military actions , and first of all to be prepared to deal with a large-scale and preemptive regional conflict .  
It has also been laid down that the joint combat center is to provide theoretical , exercise , and technical guidance for combined operations training undertaken by the entire armed forces .  
The military , as an armed group responsible for carrying out special political tasks , should not only be ready to physically fight in battlefields to complete urgent , difficult , dangerous and heavy tasks given by the Party and the people , but also live through various tests and make mental and physical contributions to the reform and construction .  
In short , every division of the armed forces should like the Party Committee of the Air Force emancipate their thinking , update their conceptions and promote a reformative and innovative spirit by launching as many competitive policies and measures as possible so that the military will really become a " warm land " attracting the majority of China 's excellent scientific and technological specialists .  
Strongly aware of future dangers , allowing no opportunities to slip , and seizing every minute , we will fulfill our work in all aspects , strive for a leap in China 's military modernization in the new century , and comprehensively enhance the armed forces ' defensive combat capability under modern technological conditions , particular high-tech conditions , so as to better perform the sacred mission entrusted by the party and the people .  
In its 70-odd years of glorious course , our armed forces , under the party 's absolute leadership , have grown from small to big , from weak to strong , and from victory to victory , opening up a magnificent chapter in history , accumulating rich experience in armed forces buildup and combat , and forming a find tradition .  
In the political sphere described by Putin as the " crux of Russia 's rejuvenation , " Russia has , by means of the Federal Constitution , straightened out the relations between the central authorities and various republics , oblasts , and border regions ; curbed the separatist tendency of local regimes ; and severely cracked down on the separatist attempt by illegal armed groups in Chechenya , initially restoring a powerful state power system .  
During the Clinton years , as the US economy was steadily strong , and salary increases for the non-military sector rose faster than did the military 's , making the military less attractive .  This made many talented people reluctant to serve in the armed forces , and various armed forces personnel in key positions to decide against making it a career .  This affected the overall quality of the US armed forces .  
Our military is an armed group for carrying out revolutionary political tasks .  This group should consistently uphold and support the reform , align its interests to the overall interests of national economic construction and serve this construction .  This group should also satisfactorily fulfill its sacred duty of protecting national security and maintaining social stability .  
In the past five years our army has completely fulfilled the strategic task of reducing its personnel by 500,000 , totally ceased all commercial activities of the armed forces and armed police , won great victory in the fight against floods in 1998 , organized with high standards the parade for the 50th anniversary of the PRC , defended national sovereignty , security , and the unity of the motherland , and preserved social stability , and thus provided a reliable guarantee for China 's reforms , opening up , and modernization .  
Deputy Chi Haotian pointed out that great achievements were recorded in modernizing national defense and the armed forces during the Ninth FYP .  In the face of the complex situation at home and abroad , our army held aloft the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , and resolutely obeyed the commands of the CPC Central Committee and CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core ; ideological and political building was further stepped up ;  
We should profoundly understand the great significance of studying , and practicing the important thinking on " three represents " from the level of " the foundation of building the party , the basis of ruling the country , and the source of strength , " vigorously step up ideological and political building , and ensure that the important thinking on " three represents " is truly implemented in building national defense and the armed forces .  
We must focus on maintaining the party 's advanced nature , cohesion , and combat strength , vigorously strengthen the ideological , work style , organizational , and disciplinary building of the party in the armed forces , promote healthy practices , oppose unhealthy practices , guard against lax organization and discipline and the growth and spread of corruption , resolutely overcome formalism and bureaucratism , and build the party organizations at all levels into combat collectives able to withstand severe tests .  
To turn the grand blueprint of the " 10th Five-Year " Plan into brilliant reality and to realize the objective of modernizing national defense and the armed forces , we need to vigorously promote the unremitting fighting spirit and always maintain an elated mental state .  
In his speech , Yu Yongbo pointed out : The current education drive is an important move and practical step taken on the basis of positive education in " three stresses " carried out in party committees at the regimental level and grassroots units of the armed forces to further study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " , improve the quality of the ranks of party members , and strengthen party building in the armed forces .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out that since the United States indeed wants to use Taiwan to contain us , we can only speed up the scientific and technological modernization of our armed forced while developing the economy and striving for peaceful reunification ; we should develop hi-tech weaponry and possess at least three or four types of hi-tech deterrent weapons to counter invading forces .  
Article One These " Regulations " has been formulated in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Law of National Defense , in light of the needs of a future military struggle , and with a view to further developing the Chinese People 's Liberation Army ( PLA ) ' s military scientific research cause ; stepping up military theory building ; and raising the armed forces ' fighting capacity .  
( 3 ) Proceeding from the realities in the country and in the armed forces ; drawing upon beneficial experiences from foreign forces ; emancipating the mind ; seeking truth from facts ; boldly furthering explorations ; bravely blazing new trails ; comprehensively adopting modern scientific methods or means ; and developing a military theory with Chinese characteristics .  
They should also be introduced if they meet relevant requirements .  In short , capable personnel are the basic conditions for doing any work .  As long as the recruitment of such capable personnel is conducive to the building of national defense and to the modernization of our armed forces , we should strive to recruit them without sticking to one pattern .  
Chi Haotian fully affirmed the achievements made by military units and armed police units in participating in and supporting the development of the west .  He emphasized the necessity of gaining a thorough understanding of the strategic policy-decision made by the party Central Committee and CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin and of earnestly strengthening the sense of mission in participating in and supporting the development of the west .  
Our armed forces are a great wall of steel that defends the motherland and are also an important force for socialist modernization .  Participation in and support for the development of the west is the inevitable demand on the armed forces in their process of putting the " three represents [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] " thinking into practice .  
They must pay special attention to giving play to the political advantage of the armed forces and actively guide and help , in various ways , the people of various ethnic groups to be of one heart and one mind with the party , actively take part in the development of the western region , and promote simultaneous progress in building the material and spiritual civilizations .  
The party organization of this unit is strong in uniting and inspiring people .  Now that party members account for a considerable percentage of the military and armed police forces , if this contingent is satisfactorily administered , we will provide a solid foundation for the party 's absolute leadership over the military and provide a reliable guarantee for assuring the completion of every task .  
In the past few days officers and men of the PLA units and armed police stationed in Hainan have expressed strong indignation at the incident in which a US military reconnaisance plane collided with and destroyed one of our military planes , intruded into Chinese airspace without permission , and landed at Lingshui airfield .

In recent years , with the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic system , the party central leadership and the State Council adopted more concrete measures for dealing with the prominent problems that were affecting the order of the market economy and for effecting a fundamental turn for the better in this regard .

China is a socialist country of the people 's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance , and our party is the sole political party of the Chinese proletariat , the core of leadership of the socialist cause , and the creator of our armed forces .  This determines the scientific and correct nature of the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces .  
The true essence and vital point of western hostile forces in distorting the objective relationship between the armed forces on the one hand and the party , politics , and the state on the other and vigorously peddling these reactionary viewpoints is to attempt in vain to remove our armed forces from party leadership and thus finish off our party , state , and armed forces .

While conducting a search operation , search and rescue teams may be shielded by a number of planes , including an early warning plane , an electronic jamming plane , an assault plane , and a fighter plane , and some warplanes conducting a search operation may also be armed with high-speed anti-radiation missiles in light of actual conditions so as to suppress an enemy surface-to-air missile base and guard against a sudden attack by the enemy .  
Since ours are modernized compound armed forces formed by various services and arms and supported by some space technology , if the commanders of our ground divisions have never seen a warship , a fighter plane , a campaign missile , or a tactical missile , and if the commanders of our naval and air units have never learned about the characteristics of a modern ground campaign , we will definitely lose the most basic knowledge support in cultivating such a concept as joint operations .  
Being a law that comprehensively regularizes the work of national defense education and provides the basic standards for organizing national defense education activities among the entire people , the National Defense Education Law should be seriously implemented by all state organs and armed forces , all political parties and social organizations , all enterprises and institutions , and all grass-roots mass self-management organizations .

From northern frontiers bathing in a luxuriant spring to the south land dressing in green , from the coastal areas full of fallen flowers to the high plateaus of melting snow , the armed police units are all carrying out raids with triumphant results .  
The Hunan Command has altogether spent 1,200 man-times for such tasks as cordoning off the crime scene , armed arrests , armed escorts , and armed patrol in the urban areas in coordination with the local public security organs .  The command has successfully handled a number of cases involving sinister and evil forces that were of relatively wider impact , including the Hengyang " 6 December " incident and the Zhuzhou City " 10 March " arrests and mop-up , capturing 12 criminals , seizing one pistol and 50 bullets .  
According to the incomplete estimates of the departments concerned , at present the armed police units , in coordination with the public security organs , have smashed nearly 1,000 sinister and evil gangs and arrested tens of thousands of criminals .  They have thus demonstrated the strength of the police force and given prominence to what is right .  This has held the sinister and evil forces deeply in awe and dealt a blow to their arrogance .  
The armed helicopters conceal themselves by using complicated weather conditions , and make a sudden attack by conducting low-altitude flights and hedgehopping .  The armed helicopters land behind the " enemy " lines , and transport special task forces to press straight on the important target when conducting sabotage operations behind the enemy lines .  This kind of sudden attack is commonly seen in modern warfare , and is called figuratively as the " surgical operation " on the combat field .  
The Russian air force will optimize its setup and organizational structure through merging , reducing redundant commanding organs , and replacing backward weapons and equipment so that it will have the capability to serve as a fighting group in peacetime and to cope with local armed conflicts , thus becoming the principal attacking military service of the Russian armed forces in the new century .  
Meanwhile , upholding the principle of developing weapons and equipment in a coordinated and comprehensive manner , the Russian armed forces are developing currently relatively backward weapon and equipment programs , such as communication systems for field operations , automatic systems , and reconnaissance systems in order to enable the general level of weapons and equipment always maintain its leading position in the world .

62 and 71 airborne brigades according to the " armed forces refining program " .  It is slightly different from foreign exclusive special operations units , such as the US Navy SEALs , French GIGN , and British SAS and SBS .  It is a multipurpose special operations unit responsible for various operational tasks , such as defending mountain regions , anti-airborne operations , and coming to the relief of cities , in addition to such offensive operations as special airborne operations .  
In short , " the armed forces to be with no party affiliation " , " nonpoliticization of the armed forces " , and " nationalization of the armed forces " preached by the Western hostile forces are three poisonous swords , and their sinister intentions are to make our party " lose " its absolute leadership over the armed forces and " lose " its ruling position , to make our state " lose " its socialist nature , and to make our people 's army " lose " its political nature .  
As a huge army of 100,000 strong amassed nearby and as the three armed services , like an arrow on the bowstring , were getting ready to conduct a three-dimensional drill of forced beach landing and attacking , who would have thought that our small car with a nonresident license plate could enter this island in Fujian Province without being subject to any inspection .

They stated : The more the mainland economy develops , the more deterrent Taiwan 's medium-range missiles will have .  
During those warring years , the reason for the strength of the party growing from small to big , the propositions of the party conforming with the popular feelings , and the armed forces of the party developing like a single spark starting a prairie fire was because the party regarded doing everything for the masses and relying on the masses in doing everything as its fundamental line .  As it could fulfill what it said and represented the fundamental interests of the people , it won the hearts of the people .  
The US Defense Department recently submitted a study report to Congress which emphasized that in order to meet the requirements of future war , the US military should attach importance to integrating the combat strength of all branches of the armed forces and organize a combined rapid strike force , so as to make the command system smoother and strike action faster and more effective !  
China must be led by a progressive political party armed with advanced ideology and only thus can national liberation and regeneration be realized .  This is the conclusion drawn from the modern history of China .  
We created a revolutionary path of encircling the cities from the rural areas and seizing state power by armed force .  With the people 's army as the backbone , we relied on the people and armed them .  We persisted in educating the officers and men in the party 's theory and program and defeated the better-equipped ferocious domestic and foreign enemies in the prolonged revolutionary wars .  
We must meet the general requirements of building armed forces that are " qualified politically and competent militarily and has a fine style of work , strict discipline and adequate logistic support , " and follow the military strategy for the new era as our overriding guideline .  We must stress the quality of army-building and strengthen our armed forces by relying on science and technology and run the army according to law in an effort to build the People 's Liberation Army into a strong , modern and revolutionary regular army .  
In conducting their respective theoretical study , ideological and political education , and political theory course teaching , the central study groups of party committees , armed forces , and military academies and schools must allot special time to organize the study of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech and properly unify the thinking and understanding of officers and soldiers on major issues so that they will willingly maintain a high degree of ideological and political unity with the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core .  
Under the current judicial system , the execution of prisoners involves many different departments , including public security , armed police , judges , legal medical experts , bailiffs , prosecutors and civil administration , and their actions are strictly monitored .  The possibility of buying or selling organs is close to zero .  It is even less likely that people will be able to buy organs for 200-500 yuan as the media reported .  
Everyone said that as far as the armed forces are concerned , the most fundamental thing in implementing the spirit of the speech is to resolutely implement the strategic guideline put forward by Chairman Jiang on strengthening the armed forces through science and technology , promote the overall building of the people 's army , make proper preparations for winning partial wars under hi-tech conditions , and make new contributions to defending national sovereignty and territorial integrity , defending the people 's peaceful labor , and preserving world peace .  
Everyone said , in building a powerful modernized and regularized revolutionary armed forces , it is essential to consistently uphold the fundamental principle of absolute party leadership over the armed forces , and resolutely resist the influence of erroneous trends of thought such as " separating the armed forces from the party , " " depoliticizing the armed forces , " and " nationalizing the armed forces . "  
Everyone held that upholding the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces is a great creation of our party and a political strong point unique to our armed forces , and is also the fundamental guarantee for our armed forces always being in an invincible position .  
Cao Gangchuan stressed that implementing the spirit of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech requires fully undertaking the armament mission and duty , while linking this closely with steadfast implementation of policies of the Party 's route , while linking this closely with implementation of the Party 's basic guiding principles in the current phase , while linking this closely with the fundamental achievement of the magnificent objective of socialist modernization by the middle of this century , and making the demands of the " three represents " a part of our armed combat preparations .  
It will guarantee the satisfactory fulfillment of our major scientific research and experiment mission , guarantee the safety and stability of the armed forces .  It is a realistic test of our study and implementation of the spirit of General Secretary Jiang 's important speech , and balance every level of Party committee and leadership levels with the basic standards for official achievements .  
Utilizing their advantages of having a strong capacity of sudden attack , people 's armed forces departments in Gulou , Taijiang , and three other urban districts have organized an ad hoc team composed of 1,000 militiamen to participate in the local " strike-hard " campaign and maintain social security in coordination with public security departments so as to safeguard the fundamental interests of the people .  
All military units and armed police units should offer assistance to areas inhabited by minority ethnic groups , old revolutionary base areas , border areas , and areas bogged down in serious poverty in the central and western parts of the country .  
A rapid response unit will join in the military exercise for the first time .  The special armed unit whose members were transferred from the Beijing Theater 's certain group army , has accomplished various assault training missions in northern China over the last two years .  The unit has been airlifted to the Fuzhou Theater by Russia-made IL-76 transport planes to join in live-fire training .  In addition , the airborne force is now in a predetermined area awaiting orders .  The marine corps has also sent a task force to take part in the war drill .  
Second stage .  The three forces will cooperate in see crossing and landing operations , including simulated missile attacks , air assaults , night airborne raids , naval and ground forces occupying islands and launching sudden attacks , the special armed unit 's sudden attacks on ports or airports , and house-to-house fighting .  This reveals that the PLA 's island-attacking pattern has begun to change from " marine landings " into " airborne assaults . "  Under the new pattern , cracks troops rather than large numbers of troops will be sent to occupy important strategic points .  
The magazine says that in the planned military exercise , the PLA will use the following hi-tech weapons : Feibao medium range fighter-bombers , IL-76 transport planes , Zhi-9 armed helicopters , modern class warships , Kilo class submarines , Dongfeng - 15 tactical ballistic missiles , 63A tanks , S-300PMU1 air-defense missiles , Daoer M1 air-defense missiles , and red earth shells .  
Grasping the historical trend and keeping in step with the times , the CPC , armed with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and Deng Xiaoping Theory , has done everything for the people , relied on them , kept blazing new paths for revolution , construction , and reform , continuously united the tremendous strength of the people of various nationalities who are advancing bravely , and continued to win their deep love and respect .  In the revolutionary war years , party members shed their blood and laid down their lives ;  
A certain airborne unit has put the emphasis of its airborne training reform this year on having a communications support from an officially and systematically organized , well-equipped follow-up airborne signal unit .  It has organized parachute jumping training programs for officers and men of signal unit , including fully armed individual jumping , fully armed and heavy-load unit jumping , and field communications support training in complex terrain and adverse weather conditions .  
Over the past three years , by accepting and resettling a total of 4,008 demobilized military cadres , as well as 270 camp families , the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region has successfully completed the state-assigned resettlement task and basically attained the goal of making the armed forces , the local authorities , and the demobilized cadres feel satisfied .  
The PLA , armed police , and law enforcement units stationed in Tibet are strong pillars and loyal guards who safeguard the motherland 's frontier areas and Tibet 's stability .  They are important forces for building the socialist material and spiritual civilizations in Tibet . They must continue to carry forward their fine traditions and work styles , ensure their own construction , strengthen their unity with the local governments , civilian authorities , and the people , and make new contributions to Tibet 's stability and development .  
The appointment of certain a retired lieutenant colonel of the national armed forces by the name of Liu to be a regimental commander with the rank of colonel in the Nanjing Military Region is the first case in which the Chinese communists have appointed a turncoat of Taiwan 's national armed forces as field commanding officer with real power .  
Through extensive investigation , the unit concerned discovered from information obtained that the Chinese communists are in the process of drawing up a complicated plan for conducting united front work among Taiwan troops , and the case is an experiment to test how well Officer Liu can assimilate into the PLA and whether their plan to form a united front with our national armed forces is feasible .  
According to our intelligence , the Chinese communists have not yet completed the plan for " the encouragement of retired officers and men of national armed forces to cross over to serve the PLA . " The Chinese communists are expected to announce and publicize the completed plan in six months at the earliest or before the presidential elections in 2004 at the latest to break down the morale of our troops .  
These people naturally bear a grudge against the armed forces or the government .  Since military personnel have their deep-rooted political belief and ideology , the top military and intelligence leaders are taking communist China 's military united front work plan for the recruitment of our retired servicemen very seriously .  The unit concerned has in fact identified a certain retired army lieutenant general as a possible hidden target of military united front work by the Chinese communists , as he has been seeking advantage for himself by all means on the mainland .  
To cope with the situation as quickly as possible , the government should increase high-technology weapons , get rid of the thinking of symmetrical operations , change the current situation in which the army amounts to a higher proportion in the three armed forces , and implement as quickly as possible the tactic of downsized troops .  In this way , the situation in which outlays for personnel maintenance accounts for half the annual defense budget and eats up the military investment budget can be avoided and fighting capability will be intensified .  
The US military has to spend a huge amount of fund to sustain the armed forces capable of fighting " two wars . "  This strategy requires that the United States maintain at least 1.4-million troops on active service .  Even with such a massive army , the Pentagon has to admit , the United States can only undertake less than a half of the war tasks .  
To prove that all this is not non-existent , the US Department of Defense recently also announced that it would provide Taiwan a " joint tactical information transmission system " worth $ 725-million and transform Taiwan 's " joint operation command center of the three armed services " and the operation command centers of various types of units , so that the United States and Taiwan could be linked through identical operation command systems .  
Besides , speaking of the US Defense Department 's decision on selling 50 sets of advanced " joint tactical information distribution systems " to Taiwan , Fu Wei-ku stated : The advanced tactical information distribution system will help Taiwan 's three services reorganize and integrate their telecommunication systems , and to share telecommunication equipment and language with " fraternal forces " as well , and this will in turn benefit Taiwan 's armed forces in " joint operations , " and even in " allied operations . "  
It was a mid-summer day .  A certain corvette unit of the navy received the order and rapidly set numerous corvettes and armed fishing vessels at sea in a mixed formation .  After passing through an area covered with islands and reefs , the formation launched a surprise attack and staged a terrific " annihilation battle " in the area where the enemy was operating .  
In order to ensure harbor safety and a smooth navigation channel during wartime , the unit made full use of local fishing vessels in their preparations for military struggles and regarded conducting joint military-civilian sea drills to " launch counterattacks on small-scale enemies " an important study subject .  After repeated deliberations and verifications , the unit drew up a plan to build a combined formation of corvettes and armed fishing vessels and lay down the principle for allocating men and equipment .  
At this jubilant moment , we would like to extend festival congratulations to all officers and soldiers of the army and the armed police force , the militiamen and the reserves , cordial regards to retired old cadres , demobilized servicemen , disabled soldiers and family members of martyrs , who have made outstanding contribution to the building of the people 's army , and high respect to people of all ethnic groups across the country who are concerned about and support national defense and army building ! 
Su Zhirong : In the new era , the PLA has set implementation of military combat preparedness as the primary objective of modernization , with the armed forces building the " two fundamental transitions , " that is : in military combat preparedness , making the transition from dealing with combat situations under normal conditions to achieving victory in combat under conditions of modern technology , especially high technology ;  
Forecasts are that in the not-too-distant future , there will be a major improvement in the academic credentials of the entire armed forces , officers and men at every level , with the tentative plan being that the doctoral degree will be a priority for officers at and above the army commander level , the master 's degree for division and brigade commanders , and a college education for officers at the regimental level and below , and this will become a reality .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized that the general task of the whole party and the whole armed forces is to meet the needs of the new international situation in the new century , gain more relatively peaceful time to develop the economy , science , technology and military to a new level , and increase the comprehensive national strength .  Only in this way will it be possible to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity better and this is the strategic policy .  
After the West 's armed forces led by the United States had sampled the " sweet taste " of victory , they intensified their theoretical research and brought forth new ideas about actual combat : building modernized psychological warfare training centers , and establishing specialized psychological warfare units .  
Afterwards , Su-27 fighters , " Flying Leopard " fighters , and Qiang-5 attack aircraft began their air raids .  Then , special armed units parachuted in for sudden attacks .  Shielded by destroyers , landing-craft vessels , submarines , and armored helicopters , tens of thousands of field army troops , the naval marine brigade , called as the world army No . 1 , and amphibious tanks fiercely attacked the offshore islands off Dongshan Island and Zhaoan Bays and attacked Penghu Island and Taiwan Island in a simulated manner .  
It is precisely these two " leaps " that have provided vast room for the development of the Japanese armed forces .  Thus , the self-defense forces are developing in the direction of long-range and massive weapons .  Moreover , Japan has joined hands with the United States to push ahead with the development of the Theater Missile Defense system in a bid to achieve absolute military superiority with which it " can both attack other countries and avoid attacks from them . "  
A certain brigade 's tactic of shooting aerial targets with light weapons achieved a combat record to be proud of on the battlefields of the War to Resist America and Aid Korea , and it was now to be put to use in attacking armed helicopters .  It had been successful in tests in attacking substitute aerial targets .  Units had demonstrated several times that this achievement uses the inferior to defeat the superior .  
Cadres and soldiers did penetrating research on foreign military equipment and discovered that , considering the defensive and maneuvering capabilities of modern armed helicopters , ordinary light weapons definitely can not shoot them down easily .  
For the sake of ensuring the unity of our motherland , the Chinese armed forces are perfectly capable of monitoring fixed and moving targets along the southeastern coast and nearby waters , to spot , track , and identify medium-sized and larger military vessels .  They are capable of anytime , all-weather monitoring of large warships ( mainly aircraft carriers ) .  
The key to building a system of logistics support that is adaptable to joint operations and to fundamentally eliminating such deficiencies as multiple channeling , separation of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , and operation via separate bodies is to take the road of integration .  This will bring about a new setup of logistics support where support for the three armed services are integrated as one , the system is compatible to both the military and the civilian , and the general-purpose logistics supplies and services are all supported in a unified way .  
However , as far as its essence is concerned , only the pattern of integration of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , which gives expression to the basic connotation of the integration pattern , can in a fundamental way do away with the restrictions imposed by " departments and regions , " thoroughly break down the pattern in which logistics support to the three armed forces is provided separately , and really effect a leap from the joint rear service support to integrated logistics support for the three armed forces .  
The policy of treating a disease by looking into both its root cause and symptoms and tackling a problem in a comprehensive way was further implemented .  Army , armed police , procuratorial , judicial and public security organizations thoroughly broke off relations with their subsidiary enterprises while the work of breaking off relations between the central state organs and their subsidiary enterprises was basically implemented and progress was also made in the work of breaking off relations between the local Party and administrative organs and their subsidiary enterprises .  
It shows the wonderful , exciting , and highly appealing shots depicting the ocean-crossing long voyage of the Navy 's destroyers , the go-beyond-the-limit flights of helicopters , the life of marines in isolated islands , the long-range raid and missile-firing exercises of an airborne unit , and it also shows the good image of the Chinese armed forces being mighty and civilized and their high morale .  The documentary is an authoritative work with which to understand the Chinese armed forces .  
He emphasized the necessity of giving prominence to key points , linking with the reality of the armed forces , closely centering around the two historical themes of " being able to win " and " not changing color " facing the PLA , thinking deeply about how to keep abreast of the new trends in the world 's military development and how to bring about development in big strides in the modernization of the armed forces , and putting forward suggestions and proposals that show real knowledge and deep insight .  
Now , it is basically provided with the capacities of conducting sea-air maneuver and conducting operations in coordination with all other armed forces .  It has played a positive role in resisting the invasion of foreign enemies , defending the security of the sea and the air , safeguarding China 's marine rights and interests , and supporting the economic construction of the state .  
Meanwhile , last year the Central Military Commission strictly prohibited the army and armed police forces from engaging in business or running enterprises and the income from their business operations which was used as welfare subsidies was thus cut .  Therefore , it was necessary for central financial authorities to compensate this lost portion of financial resources for them .  
These non-traditional acts of violence are not accepted as legal national means of war by today 's international military systems and by modern international laws on armed confrontation , because by most countries ' existing laws and moral order , most of those acts are clearly and unmistakably illegal acts of violence .  A country founded on laws and democratic traditions can not regard an illegal act as a legal means .  
The military pointed out that the result of the presidential poll , which led to a change of the ruling party , aroused discontent from military cadres , most of whom are Kuomintang members .  For this reason , Defense Minister Tang Fei and Chief of General Staff Tang Yao-ming both made speeches at the meeting , hoping that the three armed services will submit to the election outcome and focus on stabilizing the situation and reassuring the public .  
The joint statement issued by the leaders of China and Russia in 1997 indicated that " both sides advocate a new concept of security that is universal in meaning , believing that we must abandon the ' Cold War mentality ' and oppose bloc politics , and that we must resolve the differences and disputes between nations peacefully , not resorting to armed force or mutual threats of armed force , promoting the establishment of mutual understanding and trust through dialogues and discussions and seeking peace and security through bilateral and multilateral coordination and cooperation . "  
Last year when Putin acted as prime minister , he took resolute action and ordered that the Russian army recover Chechnya occupied by illegal armed forces .  Although the Russian army suffered heavy casualties , this move received the support of the people and the military .  
Luo Gan , secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission , who is in personal charge of this , has called on the state security departments , as well as the public security and armed police officers , in all localities to draw up meticulous plans and strike hard at the key Falungong elements who stir up trouble , in order to maintain political and social stability .

US Army General ( Greg Hackett ) announced on 4 April that in the next 20 years the US Army will spend $ 38 billion on procuring 1,213 RAH-66 Comanche armed helicopters ; this is the world 's first helicopter of high intelligence capacity , fully digitized and electronic ; it has good stealth capability , advanced electronic equipment , and a high degree of automation , with strong ground attack capability and relatively strong aerial fighting capability ;  
He pointed out that under the unified leadership of the central authorities , the military and armed police , the party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs regarded implementing the central policy decision as a serious political task and assigned it an important position ; they swept into action with a high sense of political responsibility and sense of work urgency , and got a really good grasp of implementation , with the result that this work has continually proceeded in a healthy and orderly way .  
Hu Jintao said that in the past two years the leadership group offices , handover work offices , and military and armed police leadership group offices and their staff at all levels have displayed the spirit of selfless devotion and the style of fighting continuous combat , scrupulously carried out their duties , worked hard , swept into action , done their work in a precise and meticulous way , carried out a great deal of arduous and detailed and highly effective work , and completely fulfilled this political task assigned by the central authorities .  
Hu Jintao pointed out that the key to why the work of withdrawing the military , armed police , and political and legal organs from business activities has been able to fulfill the predicted target in a relatively short time and has consistently maintained stability in the overall situation lies in the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee , State Council , and CMC , in the positive efforts of the large military units , armed police , and regions and departments , and in the effective support of all sectors of society .  
Through carrying out this work , not only have the military , armed police , the party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs undergone testing in stressing politics , taking account of the overall situation , and observing discipline ; we have also found a number of effective measures and summed up a number of successful experiences , which provide a useful reference for unfolding specific items of tidying things up in the future .  
If in the future a problem again arises of some unit of the military , the armed police , or the political and legal organs engaging in business activities , we will hold accountable not only those directly responsible but also the leaders of that unit in accordance with the regulations on building good party style and clean government , and will strictly discipline them .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized at the conclusion of the meeting that the military , armed police , party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs must seriously implement the spirit of Comrade Hu Jintao 's speech , further enhance understanding of the great strategic significance of the central policy decision , and enhance awareness of upholding the decision .  
Chi Haotian said : Since China and Azerbaijan established diplomatic ties , bilateral ties have developed smoothly .  The Chinese armed forces have paid attention to developing friendly ties with the Azerbaijani armed forces .  China would also like to develop multilevel exchanges between the two armies in various fields on the basis of mutual respect , equality , and mutual benefit .  
Chi Haotian pointed out that strengthening preparation for war [ zhan bei gong zuo ] , upgrading the high-tech and high-quality equipment of the armed forces , and making good preparation for properly fighting an " anti-Taiwan-independence " war and opposing hegemonic military intervention at any time are the principle for war preparation formulated by the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission in accordance with the reality that the two sides of the strait are still in a state of war and hegemony has not stopped interfering in China 's internal affairs .  
In fact , the Taiwan authorities have never relaxed military preparations for " armed resistance to reunification . "  They have purchased a massive amount of advanced weaponry from foreign countries and sought to join the theater missile defense system in a bid to establish a certain disguised form of military alliance with the United States and Japan .  
The forthcoming issue of the " Zhongguo Pinglun " monthly , which will soon be published here , has disclosed : Once a situation involving " Three Ifs " as laid down in the " White Paper " emerges , the mainland will adopt in light of its seriousness tactics like armed deterrent , " strike " ( a missile strike at specified points ) , " blockade " ( a sea or air blockade ) , and " landing " ( a joint amphibious landing operation ) respectively . 
As reported , the establishment of military lawyers in the armed forces ' political institutions will be put under the leadership of the chiefs of the relevant units , and political institutions will perform their duties under the leadership of the legal advisory offices of the relevant units and receive guidance from the higher level of responsible judicial departments in professional work .  
Chi Haotian said that since establishing diplomatic relations in 1985 China and Bolivia have enjoyed smooth development of friendly cooperative relations , both sides have expanded exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , military and cultural fields , to which China is satisfied , and is willing to make continuous efforts to further relations between the two states and armed forces in a healthy and stable way .  
After Chen Shui-bian , who had been a member of the opposition party , was elected as Taiwan 's new leader , the outside generally doubted whether or not the armed forces , which had been controlled by the Kuomintang over a long time , would take orders from Chen Shui-bian , who previously was strongly opposed to interference in government work by the military , called for cutting military spending , and exposed the dark side of the military , and doubted whether or not the military would stage a coup d'tat .  
He said that to promote national defense in future , we must " carry out nationalization of the armed forces , establish modern and highly-efficient military strength for national defense , conduct streamlined training for war , increase the combined combat-effectiveness of the three armed services , improve quality , improve welfare , and establish the dignity of the national troops . "  
Only when the masses of the people are educated and armed with these two aspects of advanced culture can the Chinese nation 's ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural qualities be improved unceasingly .  
The party committees and political organs at all levels of the army and armed police held during their study that , guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory , Chairman Jiang 's important speech has comprehensively analyzed the international and domestic situation and the tasks facing ideological and political work , profoundly explained the important role of ideological and political work in the overall situation of reform , development , and stability , and specifically proposed the guidelines and principles for further strengthening and improving ideological and political work .  
During their studies the officers and men of the army and the armed police pointed out that ours is a people 's army under the party 's absolute leadership , and strong and effective ideological and political work is the political strong point in our development and growth and our cherished magic weapon for defeating the enemy .  We must unswervingly assign ideological and political work the primary position in all work .  
Second , the US military has a large number of complex and high-tech weapons .  Therefore , there is a large consumption and costly price for logistical and technical support .  In addition , because of independent purchases systems for various weapons of armed services , the maintenance and upkeep is extremely difficult .  
have intensified our financial support for social security system building ; have continually increased our input in agricultural , forestry , water conservancy , as well as ecological or environmental protection projects ; have comprehensively implemented the CPC Central Committee 's decision on banning the army , the armed police , or the political and legal affairs organs from engaging in commercial activities ;  
intensified the support of the treasury for the development of the social security system ; continued to increase the input into agriculture , forestry , and water resources management , as well as the protection of the ecological environment ; comprehensively implemented the decision taken by the CPC Central Committee to stop armed forces , the armed police force , and political and judicial organs from engaging in business activities ;  
It is necessary to thoroughly understand the new and higher demands set by the " three represents " on the building the armed forces ideologically and politically .  It is necessary to further emancipate the mind , update concepts , courageously blaze new trails , and strive to make ideological and political work more lively , solid and effective in light of the new situation and tasks in order to provide a powerful spiritual motive force and a reliable political guarantee for " winning victories " and " preventing degeneration . "  
In recent years , the Taiwan authorities led by Lee Teng-hui carried out armaments expansions without restraint , stressing augmenting the Taiwan armed forces ' control of the air and command of the sea by relying on the geographical position of an isolated island and under the guidance of the military thinking of " active defensive and effective deterrence . "  The Air Force 's special budget for the purchase of F-16 and " Mirage-2000 " fighters alone was as high as $ 12 billion .  
During the visit , Jiang Zemin urged all departments participating in the cooperation of war industries to implement the principle of " the integration of military and civilian use , and the integration of wartime and peacetime needs , " meet the needs of the new situation of the development of the socialist market economy , adhere to the principle of turning civilians into a part of the armed forces , and establish a vigorous structure for the development science and technology for national defense ;  
Under the complicated struggles , officers and men of the judicial organs and armed police have taken a firm and clear-cut stand , forcefully attacked the national splittist forces and terrorist and violent criminal activities , and maintained stability of the overall social and political situation .  
In fact , since taking office Chen Shuibian has never acknowledged the " one China " principle ; he has repeatedly said that " Taiwan is a sovereign independent state , " blocked cross-strait political contacts and negotiations , and glibly talked about a " decisive battle offshore , " in a bid to reject reunification by using armed force ; and all this is related to the continual wrong signals being given by the United States .  
Seventy years ago , facing the white terror of the Kuomintang reactionaries , Mr . Deng Yanda established the Interim Action Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang , the predecessor of the Peasants ' and Workers ' Democratic Party , and explicitly set forth the political program of overthrowing the Chiang Kai-shek regime by means of armed force and establishing a political power of common people with peasants and workers as the main body .  After Mr .  
The General Armament Department of the People 's Liberation Army recently held a forum of military representative bureau heads of the armed forces , which stressed that the building of the army 's weapons and equipment must match the overall situation of economic construction and national defense construction ; it is necessary to seriously study the new situation and characteristics of the work of military representatives under socialist market economy conditions , and further speed up the reforms in the building of the army 's weapons and equipment .  
The meeting maintained : During the Ninth Five-Year period , our army 's logistics construction and reform progressed in a comprehensive way , with key areas highlighted , and developed in a coordinated way ; while living an austere life , logistics officers and soldiers throughout the armed forces worked hard , made innovations while opening up new ground in work constantly , and accomplished something significant .  Hence , considerable progress was made in logistics construction .  
more than 10,000 officers and men of a certain infantry division swam across the choppy sea fully armed and rapidly landed on shore ; amphibious armored combat vehicles struck ferociously at targets on the opposite shore , made a forced beach landing , and crushed all resistance .  
In addition to striving to stabilize the political situation , plan economic reform , pacify Chechnya , reorganize the armed forces , and declare war on the increasingly influential financial oligarchs and local warlords , he has also been actively and steadily readjusting Russia 's foreign policy and intensely pursuing a pragmatic diplomacy .  
To cut off Chechnyan rebellious armed forces ' foreign aid and route of retreat and to create conditions for a comprehensive and complete settlement of the Chechen issue , Putin has been working actively to obtain the understanding and support of the international community .  
The CMC stressed the need to finish all the tasks of reducing the size of the armed forces by half a million in the last year of the three-year deadline .  Moreover , the armed forces should concentrate their limited financial resources on striving to effect , in the shortest possible time , a complete change from a manpower-intensive and numerically large type to a technology-intensive and quality-based efficient one to ensure that they can cope with a hi-tech local war that may break out at any time .  
Practice has proved that the success or failure of UN peacekeeping operations depends on whether they are carried out in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter , and in particular , whether they follow the principles of respecting national sovereignty , refraining from interfering in other countries ' internal affairs , gaining the consent of the parties involved , maintaining a neutral stand , and refraining from using armed force except in self-defense .  
The secret national defense budget for next fiscal year will total more than 58 billion yuan .  To strengthen their combat readiness in the electronic and communications arenas , the plans proposed by the armed forces include completion of an electronic counterattack shelter network and an online defense system .  Geared against Chicom 's active efforts to develop electromagnetic impulse attack , there will also be a " project to protect against electromagnetic impulse . "  
With regard to measures against missiles , although the TMD system being developed is a thing in the far distant future , in the next fiscal year the national armed forces will still invest more than 6 billion yuan to build up joint air defense and counterattack capabilities .  
After the explosion occurred , relevant leaders of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and Urumqi City promptly went to the scene of the explosion to direct rescue operations .  Several hundred public security personnel , armed police , and military personnel stationed in the area as well as more than 100 medical personnel swiftly plunged into fire fighting and rescue work .  The injured people were sent to nearby hospitals for emergency treatment .  
According to reports , along the journey of advancing into the new century , all units of the military have rode on the strong east wind of the central ideological and political work meeting , earnestly acted in the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's important speech , and with higher standard and full of enthusiasm , striven to produce new results in strengthening and improving ideological and political education in the armed forces and to create a new situation .  
He has demanded that the Taiwan armed forces establish the strategic idea of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " and develop offensive weapons such as air-to-ground missiles , based on the notion of " repelling the enemy on the opposite shore " ; and for the first time Jinmen was included in the " Wan An exercise " on 16 August .

Chi Haotian said : Sino-Colombian relations have enjoyed a smooth development since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1980 , and the two sides have increased exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , and cultural fields .  The two armed forces have also further developed their relations on the basis of bilateral ties .  
Modern war is a huge war of attrition , and Taiwan 's limited arms will be used up very rapidly , whereas the mainland has tremendous potential for fighting a war of attrition , and this determines that Taiwan will be unable to wage protracted war with the mainland ; and given the consumption of large numbers of arms and men , Taiwan will not be able to sustain the fight for long and its armed forces will collapse .  
In the separation of government functions from enterprise management , for example , problems arising from the running of commercial enterprises by special interest entities were solved when the military , armed police and political and legal organs were ordered in 1998 to disengage themselves from commercial operations .  
The army , the armed police , the CPC committees and governments at all levels , and procuratorial , judicial and public security organs , treated the implementation of the policy decision as a serious political task .  They took vigorous and resolute action and worked in a down-to-earth and meticulous manner .  
A group of military commanding talents is in the making , who have had a modern scientific and cultural knowledge and a modern management knowledge and who are capable of using modern weapons and are capable of organizing and commanding combined operations among different arms and services .  A new enhancement has been noticed in both the military and political qualities of the officers and men of the three armed services .  
It has focussed on the major theories and practical issues related to the preparations for military struggle , thus further defining the orientation and thinking of deepening the training of troops through science and technology .  The training of troops through science and technology represents a profound revolution in the military affairs of China 's armed forces at the end of the 20th century .  
The whole army should use as its guidance Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " as well as on strengthening the armed forces and improving their training through science and technology .  In light of the military strategic principle in the new period as well as the goal of realizing the preparations for military struggle , the whole army should continuously deepen its ideological understanding .  In addition , the whole army should ensure that it follows correct orientation during the whole process of training of troops through science and technology .  
We must unswervingly focus on economic development by grasping opportunities and accelerating development .  This is a scientific decision made by the CPC Central Committee after making a correct judgment of international and domestic situation .  Facts related to China 's social development and national defense construction have proved that only when we have developed our economy , can we enhance our overall national strength and can the modernization of our armed forces have solid material foundation and strong personnel support .  
Only by so doing , can they better implement their sacred mission entrusted by the party and the people .  They said : In accordance with the guiding spirit of the " proposal , " we will focus on the overall construction of the armed forces , strive to push forward socialist spiritual civilization construction as well as democratic and legal construction .  
Recently , to allow " information to be commonly shared " and enhance our three-dimensional penetrating ability in gathering information from across the strait , the Ministry of National Defense even merged the three services ' intelligence collection systems and streamlined the information transmission methods to enliven the armed forces ' coast-based systems of early warning , wartime command , observation , communication , search for carrier terminals , and reconnaissance , thus establishing a very careful entity as well as a mobile and flexible reconnaissance and communication system .  
The most important point is whether the entire people possess a strong combat will .  This is also the core of the policy of " national defense by the whole people . "  As long as the people throughout the country strengthen their mental defense , reinforce the all-people 's defense mechanism , do not fear communist China 's propaganda offensive and military threat , and remain a backing for the government and armed forces , the armed forces will certainly have confidence and ability to ensure the country 's security .  
2 .  The two sides agree to maintain frequent exchange of visits and contacts between top leaders of the two countries .  The two sides also agree to further strengthen the friendly exchanges and cooperation between their governmental institutions , parliaments , political parties , armed forces and non-governmental organizations with a view to enhancing mutual trust and friendship and promoting an all-round , steady , and in-depth development of the bilateral relations .  
The regular meeting of the general staff departments of the Chinese and Russian armed forces to discuss international and regional situations and issues of common interest is an important component of the Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership and a specific embodiment of the further development of relations between the two armed forces , and it will help both sides not only strengthen mutual understanding and trust but also coordinate their stand and strengthen their cooperation in international affairs .  
At the end of the visit , Chi Haotian said he was accorded a warm reception by the Algerian Government and armed forces during the visit .  He also had fruitful talks with leaders of the Algerian Government and armed forces on issues of common concern .  The visit has enhanced mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples and armed forces of the two countries and achieved complete success .  
Wu Shih-wen said : The budget of our national armed forces for this year was cut to NT $ 27.19 billion from the previously projected NT $ 320 billion in consideration of the government 's funding shortages or lower than 17 percent of the government 's total budget , the lowest ratio in recent years .  Therefore , he appealed legislators " not to be too hard " as to further cut the budget .  
The conference was attended by the principal party and government comrades of the provinces , autonomous regions , municipalities , cities given separate listing in the plan [ ji hua dan lie shi ] , and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps ; the principal responsible comrades of departments concerned of the CPC Central Committee , and of ministries , commissions , and relevant units of the State Council ; and responsible comrades of the PLA general departments and the armed police .  
In addition , the vast numbers of public security and judicial cadres and policemen as well as armed police officers and men have devoted to their posts and indomitably fought against crimes , making great contributions to safeguarding social and political stability .  On behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council , Wei Jianxing expressed his sincere solicitude and high respect to all public security and judicial cadres and policemen as well as all armed police officers and men in the country .  
Their common goals are : Actively explore China 's enormous market , strive hard to bring China into the world economic and international political systems dominated by the West , use the game rules formulated by Western countries , which are led by the United States , to restrain China , maintain the status quo in the Taiwan Strait , prevent armed conflict in the Taiwan Strait , strengthen ties with regional allies , and step up the efforts to contain and guard against China in the security domain .  
It was learned that during PLA 's scientific and technological training activities , this platform has been utilized many times , and its advanced function and fine effect has been highly appraised by the PLA general departments and well received by offices and men of various armed forces .  
he laid very great stress on the question of how to fight to win a partial war under hi-tech conditions , and demanded that the armed forces have a clear understanding of the new situation , further enhance their awareness of hardship , and step up their training with a high degree of political responsibility and the sense of urgency of seizing the day ; they should also make military training more targeted and narrow the gap between training and actual combat . 
Revolving around the political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity of troops , the entire military and armed police force regard resisting " red lanterns and green wine " [ feasting and revelry ] and preventing the erosion of decadent ideology and culture as a breakthrough point to vigorously grasp the education and consolidation of ideologies , styles , and disciplines as well as the internal and external relations .  
The fruitful achievements of the " four educations " in the People 's Liberation Army and the armed police force have provided beneficial inspiration for strengthening and improving the ideological and political work in our Party and our military during the new historical period .  
Over the educational practice of the last six years , the party committees and political organs at all levels of the entire military and the armed police force have justifiably and loudly upheld high quality and style , explained well large principles , propagated advanced things and developed healthy tendencies in a large way , and refuted erroneous ways and rectified unhealthy tendencies in a clear-cut manner , thus creating a strong public opinion and excellent ideological atmosphere about taking the overall situation into consideration , emphasizing the dedication , and observing disciplines .  
According to the white paper " China 's National Defense in 2000 " published in mid-October of this year , since 1995 China has declared two rounds of military cuts , which resulted in the cutting of a total of 1.5 million personnel from the military , thereby significantly reducing the size of the military and streamlining military establishments .  Now the established size of the entire military is kept under the level of 2.5 million personnel , and consequently the Chinese military has embarked on the road toward streamlined armed forces with Chinese characteristics .  
Because of the increasing tighter budgets for national defense and because the navy hoped to include the budget for purchasing Kidd-class warships into the investment budget checked and verified by the Headquarters of the General Staff to avoid increasing government spending or squeezing out investment budgets of friendly armed services , the naval personnel told the US side at the very beginning of the talks that they could only buy three warships instead of four if the prices could not be reduced .  
The " Yining incident " occurred on 5 February 1997 , when nearly 1,000 young Uygurs held a march in Yining demanding that the government authorities release a number of young Uygurs arrested for writing an antigovernment article ; the march turned into a riot , with the young Uygurs shouting Xinjiang independence slogans and attacking Chinese and setting fire to the bodies of Chinese they had beaten to death ; large numbers of public security personnel and armed police came out to suppress them , and calm was eventually restored next day .  
Those attending the evening party and watching the performances also included leading comrades of relevant departments of the central and state institutions , the national leading group for the double support work , Beijing Municipality , the four general departments of the People 's Liberation Army , the major units of the armed forces stationed in the capital city , the armed police force , and the General Office of the Central Military Commission .  
First , give priority to preventing , cracking down hard , and punishing corruption in the antigraft , discipline inspection , procuratorate , supervisory , court , auditing , judicial , customs , public security , armed police , and army systems ; since these are state dictatorship organs , on the one hand the state has to ensure that they " eat imperial grain , " and on the other hand the state demands that they must fairly enforce the law and ensure honest government .  This is the precondition for opposing corruption in China .  
Le Kha Phieu spoke highly of the fruitful cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and military fields between Vietnam and China and appreciated China 's great achievements in reform and opening up .  He also said Vietnam attaches great importance to China 's experience and believes that the friendly cooperation between the two countries and the two armed forces will surely develop better in the new century .  
and uncertain factors that may affect international peace and security will continue to increase .  We must keep a strong sense of crisis , and lose no time in doing a good job in all fields , striving to advance the modernization of our armed forces by leaps and bounds in the new century and comprehensively enhance the defensive combat capacity of our armed forces under the conditions of modern technology , especially high technology , thus better fulfill the sacred tasks assigned to us by the party and the people .  
When inspecting Fort Stewart military base as commander-in-chief of armed forces for the first time on Monday this week , Bush announced that the military expenditure for the next fiscal year would be increased by another $ 14 billion , bringing the total US military budget to $ 31 billion .  
In recent years , thanks to the sustained boom of the US economy , the pay in nonmilitary sectors has been increasing rather fast and the appeal of the armed forces has diminished .  Outstanding talent is unwilling to serve in the military and those who are already in the military are not contented .

As Chinese know from their own books , " The Chinese armed forces held Shanghai amidst bitter fighting from August to November , and even then the Japanese were unable to completely rout the Chinese . " But in the relevant Japanese film , the viewer only gets two images - - " Fighting has spread to Shanghai , where our forces are heavily engaged , " and " Valiant naval airmen who gave their lives " - - that gloss right over actual events .  
It is no accident that jeeps traversing the mountain forests today are able to climb steep slopes and ford streams . The fact is that overcoming dangerous obstacles is part and parcel of their basic nature . During World War II the American armed forces produced a powerful " general purpose " vehicle which could be driven across sand , mud and gravel , which could cross shallow rivers and climb steep slopes .  
The Investigation Bureau has received a tip that organized crime might be involved in the development of a radio communications system and related equipment , a project being carried out by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology on contract to the armed forces .

The same holds true regarding the level of technical expertise required to carry out its operations . "  
Hau Pei-tsun , a former premier as well as chief of the General Staff , was a member of the armed forces for most of his career . Speaking about his experience as chief of the General Staff , Hau has stated that the military already has a perfectly sound procurement system , and that the important thing is the ethical standards of the officers in charge . If top generals get involved in politics and start engaging in tricky power plays , the military will naturally fall into disarray .  
In military affairs , after the PRC unilaterally broke off negotiations in 1995 , they initiated a series of missile tests in the Taiwan Strait . According to the ROC Ministry of Defense , in recent years the PRC has continually seen Taiwan 's new generation of military capabilities as its primary hypothetical enemy and undertaken numerous military exercises based on this premise . In addition , the national defense report just issued by the PRC emphasized repeatedly that the possibility of using armed force against Taiwan could not be excluded .  
According to the PRC 's national defense white paper for this year , mainland China has realized that there is a global trend toward domination of the battlefield through high-technology weapons . Therefore , the PLA is aggressively " moving along the path of a streamlined , high-quality military with Chinese characteristics . " The PRC plans to reduce its total armed forces by 500,000 men within three years , so that the PLA will stabilize at a level of about 2.5 million personnel .  
Before the war , he only hunted animals , or perhaps would take part in an occasional " headhunting ceremony . " In either case , he acted on his own behalf , or at most on behalf of his tribe in times of armed conflict with neighboring tribes . After the war broke out , though , he was acting on behalf of the entire nation . The sacrifices he made were for a society that extended far beyond the confines of his tribe , and his actions took on a totally different significance .  
As for gangs and secret societies , these are organizations which have existed among the common people in China since ancient times . They began to grow more widespread in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties , and particularly after the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns [ 1723-1795 ] , they spread all over China like a cancer . I call them " local armed fighting groups , " and in fact what they did was to fight and grab territory .

Sadly , " because these grass-roots anti-Japanese movements had no clear political objectives and the fighters had no military training , the years of rebellion all came to naught , " says Chien Jhiung-jen , a professor of humanities at Providence University and author of the book The Taiwan People 's Party . From these bloody lessons , Taiwan 's gentry realized that there was no future in armed resistance , and so began the non-violent approach to challenging the colonial regime .

This is why we hope that the United Nations , through the recently established United Nations Mission in Guatemala ( MINUGUA ) , will continue to contribute , directly or indirectly , to securing a prompt conclusion to negotiations aimed at bringing a speedy and definitive end to the domestic armed conflict that has plagued Guatemala during more than 30 years of struggle which is as tragic as it is pointless .  
As the international community is aware , the Agreement signed at Chapultepec , Mexico , in January 1992 put an end to the armed conflict in El Salvador , marking the conclusion of the first phase of the peace process but the beginning of a complex and difficult period of transition during which the commitments made served as the framework for a developing political , economic and social process , which we are convinced will culminate in the consolidation of democracy . 
The Executive Committee expressed its deep concern and preoccupation with the immense human suffering and loss of life in recent crises and the scale and complexity of current refugee problems , and deplored the incidence of armed attack and of murder , rape and other violations of fundamental rights , as well as refoulement and denial of access to safety .  
The Committee regrets that the headquarters of the General Intelligence Department has been recognized as an official prison , that the armed forces officers are granted the capacity of public prosecutors , that they have the capacity of detaining suspects incommunicado , whether military persons or civilians , until the end of their interrogation for periods of up to six months , and that detainees are deprived of access to judges , lawyers or doctors .  
Morocco , which opted for dialogue as a fundamental principle in its policy vis - - vis its neighbours , propounded that principle in international forums as the best means of avoiding armed conflict and sought to settle all problems by peaceful means , remains convinced that its historical ties with Spain , coupled with the two countries ' common economic interests , will help overcome the difficulties that stand in the way of a solution to this dispute .

While on the subject of youth issues , we should refer to the importance of devoting special attention to the neediest categories of society , especially the handicapped and those who live in rural areas in which only basic services are available to the young , as well as the inhabitants of areas with particular difficulties , such as those under occupation and those afflicted by armed conflicts .  
We share the Secretary-General 's positive outlook , which is based on the prospect of the region 's being free of armed conflicts and effecting institutional changes capable of supporting new programmes of social and economic reforms that will make it possible to consolidate sustainable development .  
All of us here are aware that threats to international peace and security arise from the deterioration of the social , economic and institutional fabric of States , and that their worst effects , such as internal armed conflicts , drug trafficking , corruption and the inevitable sequel of those ills , poverty , are the seed-bed in which international conflicts tend to germinate . 
Indeed , given the presence and the flow of refugees and displaced persons on our territory , and aware of the importance of international solidarity which was manifest during the ecological catastrophe at Lake Nyos in Cameroon in 1986 and of the need to confront unpredictable situations in an uncertain future , my Government decided to establish within Cameroon 's armed forces a specialized unit for peace-keeping and humanitarian assistance operations .  
As I have said on other occasions , this state of affairs is aggravated by armed conflicts , civil wars , the AIDS pandemic added to other devastating or debilitating endemic illnesses , such as malaria and by emergency situations , such as famine , drought , natural disasters , desertification and so on .  
For our part , in addition to supporting the Assembly resolutions on the subject , we have declared a unilateral moratorium on mine production , and with regard to a case which affects us directly the mines planted by our armed forces on the Malvinas Islands in 1982 we have offered our cooperation and financial help to the United Kingdom for their removal , which is proceeding with the greatly appreciated cooperation of the United States .  
All armed action or repressive measures of all kinds directed against dependent peoples shall cease in order to enable them to exercise peacefully and freely their right to complete independence , and the integrity of their national territory shall be respected .  The Declaration , which was adopted without a dissenting vote , was an expression of the world 's desire to speed up the liberation of colonial peoples .  
I fear that there are States in which regular armed forces , insurgent groups or civilians are engaged in mine laying right now , and that , as I speak , arms manufacturers in some States are exporting mines , indifferent to the likelihood that they will be used recklessly and wantonly in breach of fundamental humanitarian principles on the protection of civilians from deliberate or indiscriminate attack .  
By this I mean , for example , earmarking for the armed forces imposts on exports of raw materials such as oil or preferential treatment for businesses controlled or owned by the armed forces , which may also be stockholders in major public and private companies .

" Expressing grave concern that the number of armed conflicts has not decreased since the end of the cold war , and that international and ethnic conflicts are an ongoing reality in nearly every region , resulting in violations of human rights , especially those of women and children , including massive loss of life ,  
Countries should take urgent measures to avert the ongoing rapid environmental and economic degradation in developing countries that generally affects the lives of women and children in rural areas suffering drought , desertification and deforestation , armed hostilities , natural disasters , toxic waste and the aftermath of the use of unsuitable agro-chemical products .  
Among these are chronic hunger , malnutrition , illicit drug problems , organized crime , corruption , foreign occupation , armed conflicts , illicit arms trafficking , terrorism , intolerance and incitement to racial , ethnic , religious and other hatreds , xenophobia , and endemic , communicable and chronic diseases .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger and disability , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
In order to counter the instability posed by the production and proliferation of weapons , women 's non-governmental organizations have called for reductions in military expenditures world wide and for the elimination of the international weapons trade , questioning the morality of a militaristic culture and armed conflict as a means of resolving disagreements .  
These unconstitutional and illegal acts , which in essence , constituted political and legal aggression against a sovereign State , namely the Azerbaijani Republic , have never been repudiated by the Republic of Armenia , thus proving that Armenia should bear sole responsibility as the organizer and principal agent of the aggression against Azerbaijan . During this seven-year war , the armed forces of the Republic of Armenia have committed thousands of crimes in Azerbaijani territory .  
Any armed attack on the civilian population is obviously prohibited , and that prohibition does not end even if the indirect aim is to achieve military objectives , unless there is a pressing military need and , at the same time , a certain proportionality between the military objective to be achieved and the expected and foreseeable harm which may be caused to the civilian population .  
These confidence-building measures , which could lead to an informal suspension of offensive military operations , would constitute a demonstration of good will aimed at alleviating the suffering of the civilian population in areas affected by the armed confrontation , protecting human rights and facilitating the work of MINUGUA as well as all national entities devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights . 
Let me assure you that the Government is prepared to propose the necessary transitional or definitive amendments to the electoral law and is already working on the various legal formulae which , once the armed conflict is over , would enable URNG members to be reintegrated into society on a basis of full legality and without any restriction on their civil and political rights .  
Notes with concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes also that there is as yet no process or timetable for concluding the National Convention ;  
The Conference also took a position against violations of the human rights of women in armed conflicts and considered , inter alia , that systematic rape , sexual slavery or forced pregnancy are violations of the fundamental principles of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
Undoubtedly the establishment by the Security Council of ad hoc tribunals such as those for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda marks a momentous progress in the fight against human rights abuses and fleshes out the basic demand for international justice as a means of contributing to real and lasting peace in countries torn by armed conflict and beset by large-scale disregard of human dignity .  
Many countries allocate considerable proportions of public expenditures for food subsidies , but the bulk of those allocations go to civil servants , the police , families of the armed forces , and factory employees - in sum , largely to urban areas where they benefit middle - income groups , while the rural and urban poor benefit only marginally .  
Expressing grave concern that the number of armed conflicts has not decreased since the end of the cold war , and that international and ethnic conflicts are an ongoing reality in nearly every region , resulting in violations of human rights , especially those of women and children , including massive loss of life ,  
Among these are chronic hunger , malnutrition , illicit drug problems , organized crime , corruption , foreign occupation , armed conflicts , illicit arms trafficking , terrorism , intolerance and incitement to racial , ethnic , religious and other hatred , xenophobia , and endemic , communicable and chronic diseases .  
The first use of armed force by a State in contravention of the Charter shall constitute prima facie evidence of an act of aggression , although the Security Council may , in conformity with the Charter , conclude that a determination that an act of aggression has been committed would not be justified in the light of other relevant circumstances , including the fact that the acts concerned or their consequences are not of sufficient gravity .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the [ universal ] human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , including women migrant workers , women in poverty living in remote communities , [ destitute women ] , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and women living under foreign occupation or alien domination or where acts of terrorism occur , are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
international humanitarian and international human rights instruments to prevent all forms of violence against women in situations of armed and other types of conflict and undertake full investigations of all acts of violence against women committed during war , in particular [ systematic rape ] and sexual slavery , prosecute all criminals responsible for war crimes against women and provide full redress to women victims ;  
Encourage the future development of peace research involving the participation of women to examine the impact of armed conflict on women and children , and the nature and contribution of women 's participation in national , regional and international peace movements ; engage in research and identify innovative mechanisms for containing violence and for conflict resolution for public dissemination , for use by women and men ; ( d ) bis Develop and disseminate research on the physical , psychological ,  
Even though reliable statistics on the exact numbers of disabled persons in the region have yet to be compiled , indications are that in recent years cases of disability have increased dramatically in a number of African countries as a result of natural disasters , protracted internal armed conflict , famine and malnutrition , and the resurgence of once-controlled diseases such as tuberculosis .  
As a result of this most irresponsible approach to the fate of their country and its people on the part of the leaders of the armed groups , the peace process in Liberia remains deadlocked : the cease-fire has been broken , and an increase in hostilities has been reported , accompanied by human rights violations on a massive scale .  
The Constitution of El Salvador , amended pursuant to the peace agreements , gives the President of the Republic the power to use the armed forces for the maintenance of domestic peace , tranquillity , order and public safety " in exceptional cases , where the normal means [ for that purpose ] have been exhausted " .  
Subparagraph ( c ) was viewed as calling for further clarification : it was suggested that an exhaustive list of offences should be provided , to dispel the confusion created by the terms " serious violations " and " grave breaches " of the Geneva Conventions and to indicate whether the provision covered not only international but also internal armed conflicts taking into account the statute for the Rwanda Tribunal and the current reality of armed conflicts .  
It also demanded the immediate withdrawal of Bosnian Serb paramilitary units from areas surrounding that town and the cessation of armed attacks against it , requested the Secretary-General to take steps to increase the presence of UNPROFOR in Srebrenica and to arrange for the safe transfer of the ill and wounded , and decided to send a mission of Council members to ascertain , first hand , the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
The Council declared that Sarajevo and other such threatened areas , in particular the towns of Tuzla , Zepa , Gorazde , Bihac , as well as Srebrenica , should be treated as safe areas by all the parties concerned and should be free of armed attacks and from any other hostile act .  
The prudent action of the military authorities , who were aware of the guerrilla presence in the city and promptly informed MINUGUA , postponing the arrival of army troops at those points until after the URNG forces had withdrawn , avoided an armed confrontation that could have seriously endangered numerous civilians .  
We note with regret that half a year has passed since the signing of the Accra agreement , but that the Liberian parties have not implemented its basic provisions , thus demonstrating a clear disregard for the future of their own country and for the aspirations of its people , a people essentially held hostage to the personal political ambitions of the leaders of the armed factions .  
New hostages have been taken , United Nations observation posts manned by brave put poorly armed Dutch peace-keepers have been stampeded over , dozens of civilians have been murdered and hundreds have been wounded in the unprotected city , some of them while they were actually in the hospital : the inevitable and , as always , the favorite target of Karadzic 's artillery .  
The armed conflict in the north and south-west , which forced most of the country 's development projects to a brutal halt , coupled with the dire socio-political situations prevailing in Ethiopia and Somalia , accelerated markedly the deterioration of Djibouti 's economy .  
The mandate included the following : all violations of human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , and in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ; all forms of sexual harassment , exploitation and trafficking in women ; the elimination of gender bias in the administration of justice ; and the eradication of harmful effects of certain traditional or customary practices , cultural prejudice and religious extremism . 
The Federal Government expects and demands that , proceeding from Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , the international community , and the Security Council in particular , take immediate and resolute measures to put an end to the aggression and the killing of the innocent civilian population and the prevention of ethnic cleansing and to see to it that Croatian armed forces withdraw to the separation lines established by the relevant resolutions of the Security Council .  
At a time when the Croatian authorities have resorted to the cruellest means - massive armed aggression - with a view to realizing the basic premise of their policy , that is , the creation of the ethnically pure State , Mr . Grani _ is attempting to divert the attention of the international community away from the humanitarian catastrophe and tragedy of the Krajina Serbs who have been forced to flee their ancestral homes .  
There have also been infamous cases in which State intelligence authorities or security forces , opposition groups , armed domestic resistance movements or criminal organizations hire mercenaries to engage in illegal actions such as forming paramilitary forces for purposes of repression , organizing death squads or providing military protection for illicit drug trafficking , smuggling or arms trafficking .  
Although the use of such a device conceals the mercenary 's real status , information such as the origin of the contractual relationship , the payment , the type of services agreed upon and the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports , may serve as evidence in establishing the true nationality of persons involved in an armed conflict who are justifiably suspected of being mercenaries .  
Beginning in the 1960s , during the decolonization of Africa , the active presence of bands of mercenaries constituted a resource for the colonial interests that wished to remain in the region , hindering the process of self-determination from which new African States were emerging or giving rise to situations of destabilization and war in which the mercenary ingredient played a primary role in intensifying and internationalizing the armed conflict .  
While mercenaries are typically present in situations of armed conflict , it would be incorrect to limit the description to those cases alone , since it applies to any situation in which the sovereignty of States , the self-determination of peoples , political stability and the human rights of populations are affected in a premeditated fashion by operations in which the active agent is a foreign mercenary specially hired to carry out unlawful criminal acts .  
The international community should give further thought to the background and habitual course of the conflicts in Africa and support African efforts to secure rapid , effective agreements guaranteeing the right to self-determination , fundamental freedoms , democracy and development for all these peoples who , despite the attainment of independence some years ago , are unable to find peace with justice and development , mainly because of violence , foreign interests and armed conflicts .  
The presence of foreigners and alleged mercenaries in the 1991 war in Croatia and in the war in progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1992 coincided with serious violations of international humanitarian law and the human rights of the peoples affected , and psychological warfare played a fundamental role in the development of the armed conflict . 
Similarly foreigners who joined the armed forces of a State as regular and permanent members and received material compensation similar to that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in those armed forces , and who are not motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain or material compensation , should not be classified as mercenaries .  
The Code , reaffirming the continuing validity of the comprehensive concept of security , set politically binding norms and principles guiding the role of armed forces in democratic societies and the relation , among States as well as the relations of States vis - - vis their nationals in the military field .  
Although the threat of global conflict has been reduced , wars of aggression , armed conflicts , colonial or other forms of alien domination and foreign occupation , civil wars , terrorism and [ extremist violence ] continue to plague many parts of the world .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women in poverty living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
The impact on women of environmental and natural resource degradation , deriving from , inter alia , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , drought , poor quality water , global warming , desertification , sea-level rise , hazardous waste , natural disasters , toxic chemicals and pesticide residues , radioactive waste , armed conflicts and its consequences ;  
The Islamic State of Afghanistan would like to assure you that the freedom-loving people of Afghanistan do realize their prime national obligation to liberate the western parts of Afghanistan , including occupied Herat , and to force the Pakistani militia out of the area by a general and resolute armed struggle , in favour of the country 's political and administrative unity .  
NULLThe meeting stressed the humanitarian element of the ever-growing problem caused by the presence of land-mines and other unexploded devices as a result of armed conflicts and expressed deep concern over the serious social and economic consequences for the populations of mine-infested countries .  
We are fully aware of the vital necessity of making all possible efforts , to put an end to existing armed conflicts , to avert such conflicts in the future and to overcome the remaining legacies of the Second World War as well as the manifestations of political , economic and social inequality and we call upon the States of the world :  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
In this context , the peace agreements set forth specific commitments whose purpose was ( a ) to establish the specific requirements for ending the armed conflict ; ( b ) to tackle some of the root causes of the conflict by starting from democratic principles ; and ( c ) to place special emphasis on the process of reconstruction as part of the economic and social development of the country .

Given the fact that Rwanda has been ravaged by the genocide and armed conflict in which systematic and gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law were perpetrated , the challenges of the rehabilitation effort remain daunting .  
His delegation agreed that the crimes covered by the statute should be limited to war crimes , acts of genocide , violations of the laws and customs applicable in armed conflict , and crimes against humanity , all of which were forbidden under customary international law , and that treaty-based crimes such as those linked to drug trafficking and terrorism should be deleted .  
The spread of conflicts and the magnitude of the humanitarian consequences are such as to require the international community to conduct an objective and responsible evaluation and take vigorous and efficient measures to end the spiral of armed conflicts and create conditions for peace and security without which the universal realization of the right to development will be little more than a good intention . 
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger and disability , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Urges all the Afghan parties to work with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
erstwhile rivalry , sometimes violent , that had existed among the nine political parties formed during the struggle against the Soviet-backed Government , appeared to have changed into a conflict among three major armed groups : the Taliban , the forces controlled by General Dostum and his allies in the Supreme Coordination Council , and the government forces of President Rabbani .  
concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger and disability , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
fact that UNHCR had been required to deal with increasingly frequent emergency situations and large-scale repatriations demonstrated that , if a lasting solution was to be found , root causes of the refugee problem had to be addressed , whether they be armed conflict , economic and social deprivation or gross violations of human rights .

with mounting concern the prolongation , and in some regions the intensification , of armed hostilities among the parties in the country , including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law , which have caused significant civilian casualties , displaced populations and destruction of the economic and social infrastructure of the country , in spite of repeated calls by the Security Council and the Secretary-General for a cessation of hostilities ,

the global level , it was pushing for a ban on anti-personnel land-mines , an optional protocol to the Convention raising to 18 the minimum age of recruitment into armed forces , and a reordering of priorities away from military spending towards investment in human development .

its previous relevant resolutions , as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights , particularly resolution 1995 / 88 , and the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights , which recognized that gross violations of human rights , including in armed conflicts , are among the multiple and complex factors leading to displacement of people , and the need for a comprehensive approach by the international community to address root causes and effects of movements of refugees and other displaced persons and the strengthening of emergency preparedness and response mechanisms ,  
Urges all the Afghan parties to work with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
Further condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian armed forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
Since women victims of conflict and refugees needed special protection , his delegation stressed the importance of the section of the Platform for Action concerned with the advancement of peace , conflict resolution and reduction of the impact of armed and other conflicts on women and would continue to support all measures to protect the basic rights of women .  Although it was primarily the responsibility of each country to ensure the proper institutional arrangements for the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , the United Nations had an invaluable coordinating role .  
BARGHOUTI ( Observer for Palestine ) , speaking on agenda item 107 , said that there had been considerable progress in the advancement of women since the first international women 's conference held in Mexico in 1975 , but that many problems remained ( armed conflict , civil and ethnic wars , new forms of racism and racial discrimination , foreign occupation and domination , extreme poverty , illiteracy , and increasing numbers of refugees and displaced women ) . 
PHAM ( Viet Nam ) said that Viet Nam had not been immune to the overwhelming refugee crisis which had affected the entire world and had worsened in recent years as a result of poverty , regional or internal armed conflicts , political , economic and social crises , violence and intolerance .  
A unique disciplinary code was also enacted ; it applies to all public servants , contractors providing services and all others who carry out public functions on a temporary or permanent basis with the exception of members of the armed forces , who are subject to special rules .  
The Committee identified as major factors and difficulties in implementing the Convention : the weak State machinery to effectively maintain the peace process ; the difficult process of national reconciliation ; the breakdown of public infrastructure and private support systems ; the large number of Rwandan refugees and internally displaced persons ; the great number of militias and some civilians who are still armed ; and the shattered economy and extreme poverty .  
The tension brought about by the presence of armed groups across the borders of other States , the tragedy of refugees and displaced persons seeking shelter in neighbouring countries and very often the consequent destruction of the environment , the spread of disease , the degeneration of moral values , the horror of suffering and behaviours far removed from human values are all situations not confined to the territorial limits of the States where conflicts occur .  
In the speech I delivered at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , I stressed , on behalf of the Government of San Marino , the need to reconsider the instrument of the embargo , its effectiveness and repercussions , especially in those cases where , in the absence of armed conflict , international isolation alone has proved a valid moral and political means of international pressure .  
The predictable result has been an explosion in the number of armed conflicts , accompanied by widespread devastation , both human and physical , gross violations of human rights , and ethnic cleansing .  
Since this initiative came to the General Assembly for the first time as a result of Nicaragua 's urgent needs in 1990 at the end of its decade-long armed conflict and of its starting on the path to democracy and economic and social development , we have seen emergency assistance to be a temporary but very effective mechanism to help resolve the difficult problems of transition .  
Our own experience has proved that national reconciliation and the cessation of armed conflicts can be consolidated only through a genuine political commitment to economic development and social justice .  
We have studied the report of the Secretary-General contained in document A / 51 / 338 and share his positive view that for the first time in three decades the region is free from armed conflict , giving rise to institutional reforms that can make it possible for there to be new social and economic reform leading to sustainable development helped by support from the international community .  
The creation of basic social services schools , health centres and the provision of clean water is an important activity which the Government has carried out with the support of the international community in order to establish minimum conditions for the successful completion of the repatriation and resettlement of those Mozambicans who sought refuge in neighbouring countries during the armed conflict .  
The Republic of Belarus deeply appreciates the efforts made by all the programmes , funds and specialized agencies of the United Nations system towards providing increased , speedier and better quality assistance to the various countries and regions suffering from armed conflicts , natural disasters , industrial ecological catastrophes and other emergency circumstances .  
Concerned by the increasing suffering of millions of victims of natural disasters , emergency situations and armed conflicts and by the attendant loss of life , flows of refugees , mass displacement of populations and infrastructure devastation , the United Arab Emirates declares its support for international efforts to assess and enhance the capacity of the United Nations and its specialized agencies to address these grave international humanitarian problems and to strengthen the participation of the international community .  
While the Dayton Peace Agreement has laid a constructive basis for the cessation of armed hostilities and the creation of a favourable climate for the formation of a stable and durable structure of state in Bosnia and Herzegovina , a great deal needs to be done to translate the pious desire of the international community into a working reality .  
There was also a broad understanding between the concerned parties that the next step would be the formation of a political commission or a broad-based , fully representative council , although some differences still exist on composition and sequence , as well as on the issue of demobilization of armed militias , the collection of heavy weapons , demilitarization and the establishment of a national security force .  
She paid tribute to the remarkable analytical work accomplished by the expert designated by the Secretary-General in her objective and poignant study of the impact of armed conflict on children , which recommended to the international community a far-reaching programme of action touching on all aspects of the question . 
An additional problem linked to the existence of settlements was the violent acts committed by settlers , who were consistently protected by the army , were often armed and who had become more violent and aggressive during the preceding year .  
PAIK ( Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan ) said that Afghanistan was in a desperate situation on account of the continued armed conflict with its attendant massacres , disappearances and violations of human rights , and that the land mines which were still widely scattered throughout the country , despite the heroic operations of the demining programmes conducted by United Nations agencies and numerous non-governmental organizations still posed a danger .  
Responding to allegations that the armed forces of Myanmar had committed unseemly acts in border areas , he rejected them and insisted that the local population in those areas was experiencing unprecedented levels of progress in the political , economic and social fields and that the armed forces of Myanmar , which had a distinguished history and a fine tradition born of the struggle for independence , were well known for their good discipline and exemplary conduct .  
It was currently preparing an integrated plan of action to combat the so-called " paramilitary " groups that had sown death and terror in rural areas , and planned to reactivate a special armed group capable of tackling those groups successfully .  
The Committee identified as major factors and difficulties in implementing the Convention : ( a ) the weak State machinery to effectively maintain the peace process , including national reconciliation efforts ; ( b ) the breakdown of mutual support systems ; ( c ) the large number of Rwandan refugees and internally displaced persons ; ( d ) the great number of militias and some civilians who are still armed ; ( e ) the shattered economy and extreme poverty .  
Resolutions of those organs have drawn the attention of Governments , the United Nations system and the general public to those problems and have called for action with regard to extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law as major obstacles to human rights .  
Lightly armed peace-keepers and unarmed civilians were sent into areas of active warfare , where their courageous efforts helped to save untold human lives and to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population .  
In this respect , we regard as encouraging the agreement reached between the Government and UNITA to establish a new timetable in order to move the peace process forward , as well as the resumption of bilateral negotiations to complete the establishment of joint armed forces .  The recent conclusion of an agreement to this end between the two parties is a positive step , which , in spite of certain difficulties which emerged , deserves to be encouraged and supported .  
Expresses deep concern at the numerous delays in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol , reminds the Government of Angola and UNITA of their obligations to consolidate the peace process and , in this regard , urges them to maintain an effective cease-fire , conclude their military talks on integration of the armed forces , undertake active engagement in the demining process , and commence the integration of UNITA personnel into administrative and governmental institutions in furtherance of the objective of national reconciliation ;

Hiding behind a " living shield " of members of the Government forces , they are continuing attacks which are compelling the command of the armed forces of the Republic of Tajikistan to abandon the positions occupied by it in order to avoid unjustified losses of life among military personnel and the civilian population .  
Noting with mounting concern the prolongation , and in some regions the intensification , of armed hostilities among the parties in the country , including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law which have caused significant civilian casualties , displaced populations and destruction of the economic and social infrastructure of the country , in spite of repeated calls by the Security Council and the Secretary-General for a cessation of hostilities ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
[ Civil , ethnic and religious strife , nuclear armament , armed conflicts , alien and colonial domination , foreign occupation , international economic imbalance , coercive economic measures , poverty , organized crime , and terrorism in all its forms are destructive to sustainable human settlements development and should therefore be renounced by all States . ]  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger and disability , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
In the months preceding the suspension of hostilities ( see para . 45 ) , there was a relative increase , on the part of URNG , in armed clashes , harassment , the installation of roadblocks and the occupation of residential areas for propaganda purposes which sometimes endangered civilians , for instance , when they were caught in the line of fire or when military units were located near populated areas .  
Urges all the Afghan parties to work with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
Further condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian armed forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
I believe that it would be a grievous setback for the Organization if , because of the current financial debate , it became impossible to retain MICIVIH , whose presence is essential to consolidate the Organization 's and Members States ' remarkable achievements in Haiti , and MINUGUA , whose presence is fundamental to realization of the best prospects that have ever existed to bring to an end the armed confrontation which has afflicted the people of Guatemala for 35 years .  
The Government of Guatemala considers that the foregoing reaffirms the mutual trust between the parties that characterizes the current phase of the negotiations , and reiterates its commitment to achieve as soon as possible a negotiated political solution to the internal armed confrontation , in order to strengthen the building of a firm and lasting peace .  
50 To this definition , the Platform for Action additionally includes the violation of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , in particular , murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ; forced sterilization and forced abortion , coercive / forced use of contraceptives , female infanticide and prenatal sex selection .  
As an official and categorical denial of the shameless accusations that have been made against the Burundian army , which certain circles have all too gratuitously and tendentiously blamed for the recent deaths in Cibitoke province , the Minister for Foreign Affairs states that , on the contrary , the forces of order have rescued many other citizens threatened by armed terrorist groups that have infiltrated into Burundi from abroad .  
While unnecessary , wanton humiliations of the law-breaking State would surely be inappropriate , one finds it difficult to see - for example - how a State guilty of such a crime as a deliberate armed attack and invasion , or deliberate , systematic , massive violations of human rights or self-determination should not be required to offer guarantees that , while preserving its independent statehood and territorial integrity , could be viewed as incompatible with such a formal attribute of a State as its " dignity " .  
The members of the Council urge you to fulfil your recent unilateral commitment to quarter 50,000 troops at the latest by 15 June 1996 and to increase significantly the number of workable weapons and other military equipment turned over by UNITA troops to UNAVEM III . The members of the Security Council are also concerned that the military talks on the modalities for the integration of UNITA troops into the Angolan armed forces were not concluded on 15 May 1996 in accordance with the timetable agreed by all parties on the Joint Commission earlier this month . 
The progress achieved in the peace negotiations and the temporary suspension of offensive and counterrevolutionary activity have created new conditions capable of permitting decisive progress in fulfilling the commitment to eradicate the suffering the internal armed confrontation has caused for the civilian population and of building confidence in the peace process .  
This is reflected , in particular , in the sharp reduction in political violence ( although the phenomenon of banditry and the abductions of election observers and officials which have punctuated the electoral campaign are still causing concern ) , the high level of public freedom , the increasingly independent functioning of the branches of Government , the strengthening of local authorities and the reduction and conversion of the armed forces .  
This was a joint effort of the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) and UNIFEM . It includes information on women and human rights , women and political participation , gender-based violence , women and armed conflict , reproductive rights and sexual rights , culture and traditional practices , the girl child , women 's rights in relation to children 's rights , and legal status versus legal reality . 
On 25 July , at around 4.30 p.m . local time in Bujumbura , my Special Representative , Mr . Marc Faguy , was informed that the armed forces had put in power a presidential candidate of their choice , deployed heavily armed units , set up roadblocks across the city and moved into the national television station .  
At a public sitting on 8 July 1996 , the International Court of Justice recognized that for the first time in history , the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict , and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law , while also recognizing that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament .  
On the contrary , armed forces fighting the Afghan Government would find such a situation very convenient for further expanding their acts of aggression including the firing of artillery and rockets on the civilian population of the capital and other acts against the humanitarian laws .  NULLAs far as the implementation of the arms embargo against the armed groups fighting the Government is concerned , these groups are not legal subjects of international law .  
However , the implementation of return-and-reintegration programmes was subsequently disrupted because of increased political instability and armed conflict , in particular in southern Somalia , provoking renewed population movements , mainly towards relatively peaceful areas in the north-east and north-west , but also within the southern regions of the country .  
" Despite the proximity of Panamanian territory to jungle areas of Colombia where organized armed groups are operating , Panama has so far not experienced any acts that would fall into the category of international terrorism , aside from threats received through anonymous calls that bombs have been planted in various public buildings and places .  
I would recall that the Iraqi Government has stated on numerous occasions that the imposition of such zones is a unilateral act that should be considered to be an ongoing act of armed aggression directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq and contravenes the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international law .  
I should like to take this opportunity to draw your attention also to the question of the two no-flight zones which the United States of America and the United Kingdom have imposed on Iraq and which the Iraqi Government has on numerous occasions said are the result of a unilateral act based on the continued use of armed force for the purpose of attacking Iraq 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence , in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
The Government of Iraq has repeatedly stated that the imposition of these " no-fly zones " constitutes a continuing unilateral act of aggressive armed force directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq , in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
The Government of Iraq has repeatedly stated that the imposition of these " no-fly zones " constitutes a continuing unilateral act of aggressive armed force directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
The United Nations is the main international organization requested by Governments to undertake tasks such as facilitating dialogue between warring parties , preventing renewal of internal armed conflict , strengthening infrastructure , improving local security and facilitating electoral processes .  
The experience he has acquired over eight years prompts the Special Rapporteur to assert that situations involving , for example , armed conflict , terrorism , or violence linked to extremist intolerance foster a growing reliance on the use of mercenaries , which for our purposes means seeking out foreign experts who are paid for services of destructive violence and deadly effectiveness .  
Although they directly confirmed that the submarine of the north side was stranded off Kangrung while drifting after engine trouble on 18 September , they branded it as an " armed spy boat " and started a provocative campaign .  
His delegation believed that terrorism could be defined as the commission of acts of murder , assassination , bombing , hostage-taking or the seizure of aircraft or ships in order to provoke a state of terror for political purposes , whether by individuals or States and whether against other individuals or other States , in circumstances other than those of legitimate armed conflict for liberation from all forms of foreign domination or from colonial , occupying , racist or other forces , and , in particular , when undertaken by liberation movements recognized by regional and international organizations .  
While rebels or armed gangs are not similarly bound by these obligations , they nevertheless are required to respect certain humanitarian principles arising from international customary law and recognized by all civilized nations .  
Since then , agreements have been concluded on human rights ; the resettlement of persons displaced by the armed conflict ; the establishment of the historical clarification commission ; the identity and rights of indigenous peoples ; social and economic aspects and the agrarian situation ; and now , the strengthening of civilian power and the role of the armed forces in a democratic society .  
It is vitally important to strengthen civilian power as the expression of the will of the people through the exercise of political rights , reinforce the legislative branch , reform the administration of justice and guarantee public security , all of which are crucial for the enjoyment of civil liberties and rights ; and , within a democratic institutional framework , it is incumbent upon the Guatemalan armed forces to discharge the essential task of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity ,  
Such practices are also liable to generate a worrying state of affairs , not only for Iraq , but also for Turkey and the region as a whole , which is primarily afflicted by the irregular situation created by the Americans and their allies in northern Iraq , not to mention the human injury to which Iraqi citizens are exposed as a result of the illegitimate activities of the Turkish armed forces and their military operations inside the territory of the Republic of Iraq . 
The Armed Forces High Command was urged to take concrete measures aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of persons belonging to minorities by eliminating discrimination against the members of minority groups and taking positive administrative steps to ensure that the armed forces were genuinely representative of the national community in their ethnic , linguistic , religious , regional and national composition .  
The fundamental changes in the world scene and the promise they held in the early 1990s , which many celebrated as the " new world order " , must not be allowed to degenerate into a dismal landscape of internal armed conflicts , widespread ethnic rivalries , unbridled nationalism and a multitude of humanitarian problems adversely affecting human well-being in all continents .  
At its fifty-second session , the Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 71 , of 23 April 1996 expressed its outrage that the abominable , deliberate and systematic practice of rape had been used as a weapon of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina , recognized that rape in the context of armed conflict constituted a war crime and called for the protection and care of rape victims , respect for the special needs of victims of sexual violence in the investigation and prosecution of alleged violations and punishment of those responsible . 
Fed with misinformation from unscrupulous sources and armed groups that are in opposition to the Government , blinded by prejudice and preconceived notions and motivated by ulterior political reasons , some countries regrettably continue to make unfounded accusations . 
The Conference expressed concern at the escalation of armed hostilities in Afghanistan , which had resulted in immense human losses and irreparable damage to the country in the economic , social and cultural spheres , and endangered regional peace , stability and security .  
The four main areas identified by the Committee at its first general discussion , namely the adequacy of international standards , the prevention of the involvement of children in armed conflicts , their effective protection , as well as their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration were addressed in the study , and were the subject of specific recommendations by Ms . Machel .  
The problem lay in the grey areas and the limits that had to be set to prevent such advisers from becoming active in internal armed conflicts or in internal security affairs that affected the exercise of internationally recognized civil and political rights and freedoms .  
In the light of events in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , serious thought should be given to the current state and future direction of the development of the criminal aspects of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
His delegation particularly welcomed the inclusion of crimes against United Nations and associated personnel and the use in armed conflict of methods and means of warfare calculated to cause widespread , long-term and severe damage to the natural environment , particularly in the light of their emergence as crimes under customary international law .  
With regard to the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of peoples to self-determination , the report of the Special Rapporteur gave ample proof of the growing involvement of mercenaries in armed conflict , especially internal armed conflict , and raised important questions on the gaps in national and international legislation relating to such activities , and as to whether the existence of companies selling security services to countries in exchange for concessions should be tolerated .  
The problems facing sub-Saharan Africa were manifold : foreign debt service , slow economic growth , inadequate social investment , drought and environmental degradation , the growing HIV / AIDS epidemic , political instability and armed conflict .  
Mr . WILMOT ( Ghana ) , commending the expert of the Secretary-General for her report on the impact of armed conflict on children ( A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) , observed that it went beyond the five main issues originally listed in General Assembly resolution 48 / 157 to address other pertinent issues such as rape and other forms of gender-based violence and sexual exploitation , economic sanctions and measures to ensure the education , health , nutrition and psychological well-being of such children .  
His delegation welcomed the comprehensive report on the impact of armed conflict on children ( A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) , prepared by the Secretary-General 's expert , and supported her proposal that a special representative on the subject should be appointed .  
In assuming its complete role , with the completion of AICC construction work , the detention facilities , increased activity with the commencement of trials , and taking into consideration the general political situation of the region , additional security personnel would be required for facilities and access control , armed escort , personal protection and simultaneous courtroom operations .  
These are the cause of confrontations and armed conflicts that unfortunately create an exodus of thousands of human beings who take to the roads : men , women , children and old people are left abandoned , adrift in despair wandering waves of humanity searching for safe or supposedly safe places , forced to survive crushed together , sometimes like cattle , in camps where the conditions were just described by our colleague from Zaire as subhuman .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism , and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Welcomes the report of the expert of the Secretary-General on the impact of armed conflict on children , [ 9 ] / and takes note with appreciation of the recommendations included therein that address the prevention of the involvement of children in armed conflicts , the reinforcement of preventive measures , the relevance and adequacy of existing standards , the measures required to improve the protection of children affected by armed conflicts and the actions needed to promote the physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of children affected by armed conflicts ; 
Both major parties in the Government had made unequivocal statements that the coming national and municipal elections in 1998 would be free and fair , and had asked the armed forces and members of the electoral commission to remain neutral . 
ICRC had also been developing a model manual for the armed forces on the law of armed conflicts , designed primarily for use by senior officers with tactical responsibilities , and intended as a reference tool for the military commander without legal background .  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
Please provide information on the measures adopted pursuant to article 38 , including of a legislative , administrative and educational nature , to respect and ensure respect for the rules of international humanitarian law applicable to the State in armed conflicts which are relevant to the child .  
Please provide information on all the measures adopted pursuant to article 38 , paragraph 4 , and in accordance with the State 's obligations under international humanitarian law to protect the civilian population in armed conflicts , including measures of a legislative , administrative , budgetary and other nature , to ensure the protection and care of children who are affected by an armed conflict .  
Welcomes the proposed measures outlined by the Government of Cambodia in its comments [ 6 ] on the report of the Special Representative to ensure that the forthcoming communal and national elections are free and fair , that members of the armed forces remain neutral during the election campaign , that the individual vote is confidential and that local and international observers are welcomed ;  
In the context of ending 35 years of armed conflict , it emphasizes in particular the need to overhaul the security functions of the State : under a reformed Constitution , the police are to be restructured , strengthened and consolidated in a new National Civil Police , which will assume responsibility for internal security ; intelligence gathering activities are to be reorganized and regulated ; and the army will limit its role to external defence and will adjust its doctrine , training , deployment , size and budget accordingly .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Welcomes the report of the expert of the Secretary-General on the impact of armed conflict on children , [ 23 ] and takes note with appreciation of the recommendations included therein that address the prevention of the involvement of children in armed conflict , the reinforcement of preventive measures , the relevance and adequacy of existing standards , the measures required to improve the protection of children affected by armed conflict and the actions needed to promote the physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of children affected by armed conflict ;  
Welcomes the proposed measures outlined by the Government of Cambodia in its comments [ 52 ] on the report of the Special Representative to ensure that the forthcoming communal and national elections are free and fair , that members of the armed forces remain neutral during the election campaign , that the individual vote is confidential and that local and international observers are welcomed ;  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes also with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
Deeply deplore the loss of so many human lives , the material damage and the indescribable suffering caused by armed conflicts in the subregion , which are generating millions of refugees and displaced persons , and express our deep gratitude to the countries and peoples of the subregion for their generous and fraternal hospitality and welcome . 
Bearing in mind that the objective of those programmes is to develop within each country a national mechanism to manage and execute an integrated programme of mine clearance and that , as a consequence of armed conflicts , the affected countries are facing considerable economic constraints , only the effective contribution of the international community can enable us gradually to overcome the serious problems caused by existing landmines .  
However , the easy availability of weapons , the high incidence of armed criminal activity and the fact that the first police officers graduated only 18 months ago are clear indications that the HNP faces formidable challenges in its efforts to maintain a secure and stable environment .  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Bearing in mind also the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Intervention , which in the Court 's view was illegal when it utilized coercive means , could take less blatant forms than the use of armed force , such as unilateral recourse to economic sanctions - a less dramatic but much more effective means , especially in relations between States of unequal power .  
The same was true of other violations of the law of armed conflict mentioned in the new draft , i.e . , the employment of poisonous weapons calculated to cause unnecessary suffering or the wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages not justified by military necessity .  
IV of the Constitution of the United Mexican States provide that public service in the armed forces is compulsory ; that it is an obligation for Mexicans to receive military instruction making them fit to exercise the rights of citizens skilled in the handling of weapons and proficient in military discipline ; that males who are Mexicans and have reached 18 years of age shall be considered to be citizens of the Republic and that it is a prerogative of those persons to bear arms in the armed forces for the defence of the Republic and its institutions .  
National military service serves to enrol personnel in the armed forces , is instituted by constitutional declaration contained in the fourth paragraph of article 5 of the Constitution of the United Mexican States , which provides that the only public service which may be compulsory , under the terms of the respective laws , is military service , which requires all the country 's inhabitants to assist in the defence of the fatherland .  
Panama recommends the inclusion of provisions , as very special legislation , that are directed at committing States to social policy allocating greater budgetary resources to finance institutions for the physical and psychological rehabilitation of children who are victims of armed conflicts , and supports efforts to implement State social policy giving concrete form to the real will of Governments . Sixth .  
With respect to the age of recruitment into the armed forces ( art . , UNHCR , consistent with the position stated above , insists that the minimum age for either compulsory or voluntary recruitment into the armed forces should be set at 18 years , and does not agree that earlier recruitment should be acceptable with parental consent . 
In its resolution 1996 / 71 , the Commission expressed very deep concern at information on rape and abuse of women in the areas of armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia , in particular in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , and considered outrageous the abominable , deliberate and systematic practice of rape used as a weapon of war which , in this context , constituted a war crime .  
The functions assigned by the Decree to the Commission relate to the implementation and enforcement of international humanitarian law on the basis of proposals submitted to the national authorities on legislative and regulatory provisions and measures to guarantee the implementation of the basic international instruments in this regard .  NULLAs to the wording of the resolution under consideration , it is important to draw attention to its authors ' awareness of the exclusion from the scope of Protocol II of situations of internal disturbances and tensions , as not being armed conflicts .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing due to a number of complex factors which include , inter alia , armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources , and environmental degradation .  
Conscious of the human rights and dignity of all refugee children and adolescents and that , due to their specific needs and vulnerability within the broader refugee population , they need to be among the first to receive protection and assistance in any refugee situation , Gravely concerned that refugee children and adolescents continue to be exposed to family separation , physical violence and other violations of their human rights , including through sexual abuse and exploitation , and military or armed attacks ,  
The delegation that had introduced a revised version of document A / AC . 252 / L . 2 ( A / AC . 252 / 1997 / WP . 10 and 12 ) as a result of the first round of discussions noted that the changes introduced in article 1 , paragraph 4 , contained an enlarged definition of armed forces that included the security forces and restricted the concept of other persons accompanying them to those who acted in support of the armed forces and were under their command and control .  
Mongolia is pursuing a policy of maintaining the size of its armed forces and its defence expenditures at the lowest possible level and of ensuring its independence and national security primarily by political and diplomatic means .  
Throughout the past few years , successive world events have indicated that disasters caused by people resorting to armed force in their ethnic , civil , ideological or border wars have been increasing in a manner unprecedented in modern history .  
We must therefore concentrate our efforts on the causes , such as poverty , armed conflicts , economic sanctions , economic imbalances , ethnic conflicts , environmental problems , desertification , deforestation , inadequate international cooperation and , above all , the problems of indebtedness , technology transfers , the provision of international financial aid to developing countries and the exploitation of basic resources and unfair terms of trade , all of which lead to greater flows of refugees across international borders , as the current international situation shows .  
The ICRC is particularly concerned with emergency situations arising from armed conflict and internal violence , which are often marked by widespread and urgent needs among the civilian population and by the breakdown of political , economic and civic institutions .  
We must see to it that these trends are strengthened and that the way is cleared for specific , tangible steps that would make it possible to move to address in practical terms the question of the cessation of the armed conflict and the start of a political dialogue aimed at national reconciliation and the establishment in Afghanistan of a broad-based , fully representative government .  
As we can see , these hidden weapons of mass destruction continue to cause irreversible damage in Central America , even though the Esquipulas process to achieve final peace in the region has already achieved its objective , putting an end to the armed conflict in Guatemala , and even though it is now seven and five years , respectively , since the civil wars ended in Nicaragua and El Salvador . The cruelty of these weapons is overwhelming . 
The International Court of Justice has declared in a historic advisory opinion that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be contrary to the rules of international law applicable to armed conflicts .  
The elimination of our armed forces and the demilitarization of our society have fostered a broad , pluralistic , representative system in the form of a democratic and social state of law , which is the legal structure representing the will for peace , conciliation and harmonious coexistence Costa Ricans have chosen .  
It has the intention of continuing the dialogue initiated there on a number of bilateral issues , including trade , which is in perfect agreement with our foreign policy agenda , which will seek , after overcoming our internal armed confrontation , to pursue a better understanding and strengthening of our international relations , thus contributing to a better understanding among peoples , including a brighter future for China and Guatemala . I should be grateful if you would arrange for this letter to be circulated as a document of the Security Council . 
Under international humanitarian law applicable in international armed conflicts , in particular article 123 of the Third and article 140 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 , this Geneva-based organization is the principal agency authorized to collect all the information it can obtain through official or private channels concerning prisoners of war and protected civilians .  
In a democratic society , the typical functions of the armed forces relate to the defence of sovereignty and territorial integrity ; any other function is atypical and exceptional ; like any other government institution , their exercise of other functions must take place in a context of subordination to lawfully constituted authority and be preceded by a decision of and be monitored by the lawfully constituted authorities of the State within their specific sphere of competence . 
Taking into account the new functions of the Guatemalan armed forces , as set forth in the Agreement on the Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the Armed Forces in a Democratic Society , and considering the Parties ' shared objective of promoting the broadest possible participation of citizens in the electoral process , the Commission is invited to examine the desirability of granting , in the future , members of the Guatemalan armed forces on active duty the political right of voting in Guatemalan elections .  
Whereas the internal armed conflict that Guatemala has experienced for over three decades resulted from the closing of political opportunities for democratic expression and participation and from the adoption of measures of political repression against individuals and organizations linked or identified with the Government overthrown in 1954 ,  
Also in relation to the clause mentioned in paragraph 20 , the National Reconciliation Act shall extinguish criminal liability for related common crimes committed in the armed conflict , such crimes being defined as those which are directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to the commission of the political crimes referred to in the preceding paragraph and which can not be shown to be motivated by personal goals .  
In respect of persons who were involved in the internal armed conflict owing to institutional mandates , the National Reconciliation Act shall contain specific provisions equivalent to those previously mentioned , in that they shall extinguish criminal liability for common crimes perpetrated with the aim of preventing , thwarting , suppressing or punishing the commission of political crimes and related common crimes , where such crimes were directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to that aim , unless it is demonstrated that there is no relationship between the criminal act and the stated aim .  
The Agreements contain not only such provisions as the parties considered to be necessary for ending the legal situation of domestic armed conflict and remedying its effects , but also a much longer set of provisions which set out a State plan which encapsulates many of the recommendations contained in the reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights , and in particular several relating to the structural changes needed to ensure the effective exercise of human rights .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
RECOGNIZING the importance of observance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and other international human rights instruments , as well as respect for international humanitarian law applicable to armed conflicts , and bearing in mind the complementarity between human rights and international humanitarian law in improving protection of the individual and respect for his dignity in situations of armed conflict ,  
Experience has shown that the United Nations has long placed special emphasis on the implementation of discretionary measures ( negotiations , retortion , provisional measures under Article 40 of the Charter of the United Nations , non-binding sanctions imposed in accordance with General Assembly resolutions and implemented individually or collectively by States , and so on ) and only in exceptional cases resorted to the use of mandatory sanctions and other enforcement measures not involving the use of armed force .  
However , if the application of mandatory sanctions in the case of an armed invasion of the territory of another State and a direct breach of international peace can be considered warranted from the point of view of the Charter and international law , in most other cases this can be - and has been - counterproductive and has had negative and destructive consequences not only for one or several States but for the entire international community .  
What is remarkable is that although Zaire is losing on the battlefield , the head of State has emerged stronger : stronger with the armed forces , which call for his leadership ; stronger in international affairs , since he is seen as the only person capable of resolving a regional crisis ; and stronger in politics , since even his most critical opponents have joined him in the effort of national reconciliation .  
The purpose of the workshop was once again to make the international community more aware of the very serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law which are committed by Government authorities , armed groups or individuals in situations of internal disturbances , crises and tensions , including latent or low _ intensity conflicts .  
He noted that humanitarian law initially had been developed in response to ordinary international armed conflicts wherein organized regular armies faced each other , and the content of humanitarian law clearly reflected its origin .  
Australia 's own decision to suspend the use of anti _ personnel landmines and to support the negotiation of a global ban as soon as possible was not taken without considerable soul _ searching given that the defence challenge for Australia is to be able to protect a vast continent with a small professional armed force .  
Those mechanisms will have to be established in a broad and realistic manner , with the help of international cooperation , and will have to cover not only financial compensation but also measures to support and assist those families and communities which suffered the worst consequences of the internal armed conflict .  
The Mission hopes that the Guatemalan armed forces , in the context of their considerable efforts to put an end to the internal armed conflict and to accept the institutional changes set forth in the Peace Agreements , will noticeably increase their cooperation in clarifying and punishing crimes and human rights violations in which some of their members may be implicated .  
As mentioned in his previous report , the Special Rapporteur continued to receive reports and information on grave and widespread violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by government agents , and abuses and atrocities committed against the life , liberty and security of individuals by members of different parties to the armed conflict in the country other than the Government of the Sudan in the areas under their control .  
Four working groups have been constituted within the Committee to assess the state of human rights education in the following areas : primary and secondary schools ; universities and higher education ; adult education , including several professional groups ( police , armed forces , judges , teachers , social workers , etc . ) ; and activities undertaken by NGOs , associations and trade unions .  
In its response , UNICEF referred to the report prepared by the expert of the Secretary-General , Ms . Gra \ x { 84f7 } Michel , on the impact of armed conflict on children , submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 48 / 157 ( see A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) .  Although the report gives extensive information on violations of the rights of women and children , it does not provide specific information pertinent to the release of women and children taken hostage in armed conflict and imprisoned .  
With respect to the release of women and children taken hostage during armed conflicts and imprisoned , an important step for improving the situation would be for the Governments concerned to ratify without delay and to implement all relevant international instruments and Conventions , and for practical and cost-effective measures to be taken to collect information on women and children hostages on a systematic basis .  Non-governmental organizations working in the field might also contribute to that effort .  
As for the plenary and the workshop topics , the International Federation recommended the following topics : ( a ) global money-laundering , suggested practical measures to combat it ; ( b ) improving extradition measures to deal with fugitives at large ; ( c ) combating organized transnational crime and links with terrorist crime ; ( d ) the ill effects of drug trafficking ; ( e ) combating bribery and corruption in all forms ; and ( f ) combating violent crimes , such as murder , gang rape with violence , armed robbery and extortion .  
In light of article 39 of the Convention , the Committee is worried about the insufficient measures taken to provide physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration to children victims of any form of neglect , abuse and / or exploitation , particularly victims of armed conflicts , sexual exploitation and child labour .  
Accordingly , and as long as the faction leaders , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their conflict in Somalia and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law related to internal armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia irrespective of whether the specific area is engulfed in active fighting .  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of the objectives of the Convention is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes also with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
The topics discussed included the question of the minimum age of those participating in hostilities , the issue of direct or indirect involvement in hostilities , the age of recruitment , be it voluntary or compulsory , into the armed forces , and whether or not a clause should be included in the draft optional protocol preventing child recruitment by non-governmental armed groups .  
50 The expert encouraged the working group , in drafting the optional protocol , to take a realistic approach in relation to non-governmental armed groups , in the light of the fact that the vast majority of contemporary armed conflicts were internal . 
In the statement at its fifty _ second session , the Commission expressed its deep concern that the disproportionate use of force by the Russian Federation armed forces was continuing to lead to grave violations of human rights , as well as of international humanitarian law .  
Taking into consideration the modest financial capabilities of the State , in this short period it has been impossible to supply the appropriate equipment and arms for the armed forces of the Republic of Macedonia at a level that would provide for an appropriate initial reaction or a possible urgent military action ;  
He called for increasing contacts across the Taiwan Straits and negotiations that would lead to reunification in which Taiwan would ' exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication ' and ' may also retain its armed forces and administer its party , governmental and military systems by itself ' .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Regarding crimes against humanity , article 3 of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda stresses the prosecution of persons responsible for crimes " when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds " , that is , it does not associate those crimes primarily with armed conflicts .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 3 June 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , giving details of the aerial violations that have accompanied the incursions into Iraq 's territory by the Turkish armed forces and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and to halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
The expropriation of land and sources of water continues ; educational and health facilities are inadequate ; the inhabitants encounter major economic difficulties ; environmental degradation is being caused by the burial of toxic wastes in the Golan ; prisoners in Israeli jails are being held in extremely cruel conditions ; and Syrian citizens are subjected to provocation by armed Israeli settlers .  
The second obstacle was the fallacious and perverse argument that the country was experiencing internally a state of dirty , unconventional war compelling the authorities to suspend the exercise of human rights and to claim , before international forums , that international humanitarian law conventions were not applicable since the situation did not involve an international armed conflict and even less a declared war .  
Thus , both international war and internal armed conflicts , just as states of tension or domestic disturbances caused by political , economic , social or cultural factors , when accompanied by clashes , acts of violence , vandalism , inter _ ethnic confrontations , terrorist attacks , etc . and provided they represent an actual or at any rate imminent threat to the community as a whole , constitute a public danger or public emergency in the meaning conferred on those terms by the international instruments referred to above .  
A relatively intense internal armed conflict ( where it is assumed that the intensity of hostilities and the level of organization of the combatants is below that required by the above Protocol ) , in which case the provisions set forth in article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions apply .  
Where this appears most clearly is in severe crisis situations involving relatively serious armed conflicts , where the international law on human rights and international humanitarian law are applied in a simultaneous and complementary manner .  
Given the complementary and non _ exclusive nature of the protective norms of international law , it is extremely important to consider the positive linkage that exists with international humanitarian law and , in particular , at what point article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , which also establishes fundamental guarantees during internal armed conflicts , enters into force .  
The Agreement on the Definitive Ceasefire was implemented and the deadlines and procedures established therein were strictly observed , confirming the willingness of the Government and URNG to put a definitive end to the armed conflict , as evidenced throughout 1996 in the peace negotiations and in the informal ceasefire which went into effect on 19 March 1996 .  
The professionalism of the role the army now plays in national life was made clear by its comportment during the electoral process of March 1997 : in marked contrast to the record of military interference in the history of El Salvador , the army demonstrated its respect for the democratic decision of the Salvadorian people that those elections represented .  8 .  Before the signing of the peace agreements , public security functions were carried out by bodies dependent on the armed forces .  
It recommended a profound judicial reform that would give the judicial system the capacity to sanction violations of human rights ; constitutional reforms in a number of areas ; the strengthening of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights ; the adoption of reforms in the armed forces and in the public security sector ; the investigation of illegal armed groups , or death squads ; and concrete measures to achieve national reconciliation .  
Even under the situation where the United States and the south Korean authorities defiantly opposed the DPRK 's proposal for tripartite talks , the great leader took the positive step of mobilizing 150,000 Korean People 's armymen for peaceful construction in 1986 to defuse the tension on the Korean peninsula and advanced a proposal on 23 July 1987 for a massive phased reduction of the armed forces and declared a unilateral reduction of 100,000 of the People 's Army forces as a subsequent practical measure .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing unstable and tense security conditions in the Gali region , characterized by acts of violence by armed groups , by armed robbery , and other common crime and , most seriously , by the laying of mines , including new types of mines , and deeply concerned also at the resulting lack of safety and security for the local populations , for the refugees and displaced persons returning to the region and for the personnel of UNOMIG and of the CIS peacekeeping force ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing unstable and tense security conditions in the Gali region , characterized by acts of violence by armed groups , by armed robbery , and other common crime and , most seriously , by the laying of mines , including new types of mines , and deeply concerned also at the resulting lack of safety and security for the local populations , for the refugees and displaced persons returning to the region and for the personnel of UNOMIG and of the CIS peacekeeping force ,  
In this connection , the Special Representative and the troika stressed once again that it was imperative that UNITA provide credible data concerning the numbers and locations of armed elements under its control , and expressed their grave concern at the inaction of UNITA in fulfilling the demands contained in Security Council resolution 1118 ( 1997 ) and the presidential statement of 23 July .  
The operation in Albania was a unique multinational intervention in the sense that the situation in the country , as grave as it was , was one of internal unrest sparked by financial crisis , not the usual kind of armed conflict between opposing sides which the Security Council most often deals with .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
Accordingly , Israel is unable , at this juncture , to commit itself to a total ban on the use of anti _ personnel landmines until effective alternative measures are available to ensure the protection of civilians threatened on a daily basis by terrorists , and to ensure the protection of Israeli defence forces operating in areas of armed conflict .  
In a separate and dissenting opinion concerning the applicability of article 2 of the statute and the grave breaches regime , the Presiding Judge concluded that at all times relevant to the indictment , the armed conflict in the op \ x { eaa1 } ina of Prijedor was international in character , that the victims were protected persons and that article 2 was applicable .  
The campaign to promote awareness of human rights and humanitarian principles was also worth mentioning for , unless discipline was maintained among the armed forces and unless universal ethical principles were upheld , protection of victims could never be established on a solid basis . 
These populations , sometimes held hostage by armed groups bent on genocide for which an international criminal court has been set up have in turn been massacred in circumstances that need to be brought to light so that a different future can be forged .  
Whereas during the armed rebellion and aggression against Croatia many criminal acts , grave breaches of international humanitarian law and of the basic rights of the individual were committed ,  
Reiterating that many citizens who took part in the armed rebellion against the Republic of Croatia have sought and been granted Croatian documents , and that they have by this act accepted all the rights and obligations that derive from Croatian citizenship , including respect for and defence of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Croatia , and that they have accepted the Republic of Croatia as their homeland and have expressed the wish to be included in its political , economic and social life , and in that way to contribute to its prosperity ,  
These include ethnic conflicts and disputes arising out of the neglect of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities ; border disputes that could lead to armed conflicts ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems ; international terrorism ; organized crime and illegal trafficking in arms and drugs ; money-laundering , contraband and clandestine migration ; and transnational environmental degradation .  
The strengthening of security in the region calls for a comprehensive approach that includes parallel steps to settle conflict situations and eliminate hotbeds of tension , reduce the level of armed presence , strengthen confidence among the Mediterranean States themselves and their mutual understanding with other members of the international community , and develop economic cooperation in the region and with third countries .  
Pursuant to the peace agreements , priorities have been set and various projects formulated with the aim of : ( a ) achieving the economic and social reintegration of former combatants and demobilized members of the armed forces ; ( b ) attending to the economic and social needs of the communities most affected by the conflict and improving the living conditions of the poorest groups ; ( c ) consolidating democratic institutions ; and ( d ) promoting legal and constitutional reform .  
Instead , it had institutionalized the peaceful settlement of disputes through the establishment of a Permanent Court of Arbitration and , in case of armed conflict , had imposed certain limits and duties on the parties at war , down to the level of the individual , in the first genuine attempt by the international community to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing owing to a number of complex factors which include armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources and environmental degradation .  
The Assembly welcomed the proposed measures outlined by the Government of Cambodia in its comments5 on the report of the Special Representative , to ensure that the forthcoming communal and national elections were free and fair , that members of the armed forces remained neutral during the election campaign , that the individual vote was confidential and that local and international observers were welcomed .  
In conclusion , the Special Representative urges the Government to complete its election preparations by agreeing on an appropriate legal framework , establishing an election commission that is clearly independent , taking legal and political steps to establish the Constitutional Council , creating guarantees that would give the political parties equal opportunities to express themselves via the media , demobilizing and disarming the armed troops of political parties , and ensuring political neutrality by all military and security forces .  
There was a general atmosphere of insecurity , in which the population suffered from the arbitrariness and brazen arrogance of the Zairian armed forces ; an inefficient judiciary ; severe repression of freedom of expression and opinion , although within the margin of freedom tolerated since the National Sovereign Conference ; systematic torture and deplorable prison conditions ; and the absence of measures to ensure economic , social and cultural rights .  
If , by a democratic regime , we mean one in which human rights are respected , power is vested in the Government by the people through free elections , there is a separation of powers , the law is enforced by the authorities , there is equality under the law , the armed forces and police are at the service of everyone , the courts perform their functions independently , political parties express themselves freely , and there is freedom of the press , then this report shows that none of these conditions are being met .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability , and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Human rights monitoring has a developed expertise regarding violations committed in a context of political conflict and repression but relative security ; it is not intended to monitor violations of international humanitarian standards in the course of full-scale armed conflict .  
The special difficulties involved in investigating violations of human rights and humanitarian law in circumstances of internal armed conflict and the prevailing limitations in this respect in Rwanda should be explicitly recognized in the reports of the Field Operation .  
Genocide can be committed irrespective of any armed conflict and comprises certain crimes ( such as killing or causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of a particular group ) committed with the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such .  
First , humanitarian law had a more limited objective than did human rights law , since it was applicable solely in situations of armed conflict and , without seeking to improve society , sought to protect the life , dignity and physical integrity of the individual against violence and arbitrary behaviour .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability , and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Recalling its previous relevant resolutions , as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights , in particular Commission resolution 1997 / 75 of 18 April 1997 , and the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights , [ 1 ] which recognized that gross violations of human rights , including in armed conflicts , are among the multiple and complex factors leading to displacement of people ,  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , particularly those of developing countries ,  
Calls upon all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in countries where humanitarian personnel are operating , in conformity with the relevant provisions of international law and national laws , to cooperate fully with the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies and organizations and to ensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel in order to allow them to perform efficiently their task of assisting the affected civilian population , including refugees and internally displaced persons ;  
Recognizing that the reintegration of former combatants and demobilized members of the armed forces continues to be one of the most complex aspects of the social and economic commitments and that the sustainability of any such programme is linked to broader challenges , such as poverty relief , employment generation , social integration , public security and efficient , transparent and speedy administration of justice ,  
Experience has shown that the United Nations has long placed special emphasis on the implementation of discretionary measures ( negotiations , retortion , provisional measures under Article 40 of the Charter of the United Nations , non-binding sanctions imposed in accordance with General Assembly resolutions and implemented individually or collectively by States , and so on ) and only in exceptional cases resorted to the use of mandatory sanctions and other enforcement measures not involving the use of armed force .  
The same gang of ultraconservatives and gangsters is responsible for the acquittal of hijackers and impedes the use of the term terrorists , while with a silent and mysterious complicity they are bolstered , funded , organized , armed , trained and assigned to intelligence missions .  
During those discussions we explained that the solution to the Kurdish problem inside Turkey could not be achieved by committing armed aggression against Iraq , or by interfering in its internal affairs , in collaboration with foreign Powers the United States and Britain but rather by fully observing the principle of mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two countries and by cooperation between their Governments to ensure security and stability on both sides of the international border .  
Similarly , we note in the report the entry into force of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) Convention and of the efforts to improve existing international conventions for the protection of world cultural properties and agree that our central goal should be increasing the number of ratifications and providing technical assistance to States with acute problems of illicit trafficking in archaeological objects , as well as aiding countries experiencing armed conflicts .  
The Rwanda Tribunal is faced with the very difficult task of adjudicating persons responsible for the most egregious crimes imaginable by the human mind : the crime of genocide , crimes against humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
In the 14 years since we began consideration of this subject , profound changes have occurred in the region , particularly since the signing on 7 August 1987 of the Esquipulas II Agreements , which established the frame of reference for the processes of national dialogue and negotiation that were required to end the armed conflicts and regional tensions by peaceful means . 
Subsequent developments have continued to be positive , and in 1997 we are witnessing for the first time in many years a Central America free of armed conflict , with legitimate Governments chosen through the free expression of popular will in transparent and pluralistic elections , thus strengthening democratic institutions and , as result , the rule of law . 
Accordingly , Israel is unable at this juncture to commit itself to a total ban on the use of anti-personnel landmines until effective alternative measures are available to ensure the protection of civilians threatened on a daily basis by terrorists and of Israeli Defence Forces operating in areas of armed conflict .  
My delegation wishes to support the proposals put forward in this regard by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the last substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , which called for the special session to have a wide-ranging agenda highlighting the following : review and evaluation of the current international situation ; nuclear disarmament at the global and regional levels ; elimination of other weapons of mass destruction ; effective reduction of arms and armed forces ; the relationship between disarmament and development ; and confidence-building .  
Regrettably , the continuing military occupation by Israeli forces of large areas of Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the presence of a large number of armed settlers in the occupied territories , the frequent roadblocks and boundary closures and the serious damage caused to the Palestinian economy all of them unilateral measures have a negative impact on the search for a just and peaceful settlement that respects the legitimate rights and claims of all the parties .  
All conferences stressed that every child has the right to be nurtured and protected by its family and that families and society must work together to improve the situation and protect the rights of all children , particularly those in especially difficult circumstances , for example children in areas of armed conflict , children who lack adequate family support , urban street children , abandoned children , children with disabilities , children addicted to narcotic drugs , and the girl child .  
For instance , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to receive information about massive displacements of populations which have occurred mainly in the context of armed conflicts , including indiscriminate military attacks against civilians during counter-insurgency operations , attacks by irregular armed groups , and communal violence .  
The Government of Iraq noted its cooperation with States and international organizations and its solidarity with the endeavours of the United Nations and the humanitarian organizations , particularly in the field of human rights , with a view to establishing an early _ warning system to avoid the problem of mass exodus or to address it when it was brought about by causes such as natural disasters or regional or international armed conflicts forcing the population of a State to enter neighbouring States .  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
In this connection , the Mission underscored the importance of excluding from the extinction of liability those human rights violations which had occurred outside the strict framework of the internal armed conflict , and the major responsibility of the judicial authorities for complying with the spirit of the law by disallowing an extinction of criminal liability for those crimes which , under domestic law or the international treaties ratified by Guatemala , are imprescriptible or are not subject to such an extinction .  
As of January 1997 , it became a constant feature of government policy to declare war and a general mobilization against its domestic and external enemies , without making a distinction between those Sudanese citizens who join the armed forces fighting against the Government which are assumed or are known actively to oppose the Government of the Sudan and those who happen to be in the conflict areas , once again regardless of their race , religion , language , ethnic or social origin and status .  
If applicable , assists the Director in preparing methods and procedures for verification of human rights during internal armed confrontation , commitment to strengthening the system for the protection of human rights , commitment relating to security forces and the bearing of arms , military conscription and voluntary nature and behaviour of paramilitary forces ; assists also in following up the verification and evaluating the findings of regional offices . 
Numerous testimonies received by the Special Rapporteur indicate that the civilian population living in or near the combat zone is the most susceptible to being forced to move : in these grey zones ( zones controlled or influenced by the insurgents ) the armed forces often resort to ground searches , destruction and burning of houses , and confiscation of property and food , which lead the people to move temporarily or permanently .  
The Special Rapporteur also observes that article 17 of Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 requires that , in the case of displacements carried out for the safety of civilians or for imperative military reasons , the responsible party must take all possible measures . . . in order that the civilian population may be received under satisfactory conditions of shelter , hygiene , health , safety and nutrition .  Article 14 of the same instrument also stipulates a prohibition of starvation of civilians under the control of organized armed forces .  
Furthermore , arms sales are also a blatant violation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts , and is obliged to avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region or otherwise contribute to regional instability .  
With regard to the military observers , their presence in Angola during the coming months will continue to be required for the verification of the implementation of the remaining tasks of the Lusaka Protocol , the monitoring of the formation of the unified army and the demobilization of excess UNITA and FAA soldiers , as well as verification and investigation of allegations concerning the residual presence of UNITA armed elements and the existence of weapons caches .  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Bearing in mind also the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Welcomes the report of the expert of the Secretary-General on the impact of armed conflict on children , [ 10 ] and takes note with appreciation of the recommendations included therein which address the prevention of the involvement of children in armed conflict , the reinforcement of preventive measures , the relevance and adequacy of existing standards , the measures required to improve the protection of children affected by armed conflict and the actions needed to promote the physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of children affected by armed conflict ;  
Based on his experience , the Special Rapporteur has maintained that armed conflicts , terrorism , arms trafficking , covert operations relating to the interest of a third party acting to harm one or more parties to an armed conflict and violence linked to extremist intolerance foster or create the market for mercenaries , defined as foreign experts whose skilled services are sought because of their proven experience in producing destructive and deadly effective violence . 
Despite the condemnations contained in the resolutions of several United Nations bodies , Governments whose power is illegitimate , armed insurgent groups and Powers acting through covert operations have been responsible for the existence of mercenary activities , with a heavy toll on the peoples whose lives they affect .  
What this report does want to draw attention to are the dangerous grey areas and the limits which need legal safeguards in order to prohibit such advisory services from becoming active armed participation in internal conflicts or in matters of the internal security of citizens that are connected with the exercise of the rights and political freedoms provided for in international human rights instruments .  
Extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law are highlighted by the resolutions of United Nations organs as being major obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
In the light of the judicial nature of the International Tribunal , it is clear that any such determination would not affect ongoing legal proceedings or the obligation to surrender persons accused of having committed serious violations of international humanitarian law while the armed conflict was still ongoing .  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
It would be preferable to support the viewpoint that the prohibited participation by children in military operations should not be designated as direct participation since the actual practice in armed conflicts hardly allows any conclusions to be derived from the proposed distinction between direct and indirect participation by children in the conflict .  
Therefore , the members of such groups should either be covered by the conditions applicable to popular armed resistance groups , thereby subjecting them to the provisions and obligations of international humanitarian law to a certain extent , or should be regarded as groups that fail to meet the international requirements for classification as legal combatants , either as members of a regular army or a legitimate resistance movement , in which case , being totally beyond the pale of the law , there would be no point in placing them under any obligation . 
Furthermore , the recruitment of children into the armed forces of States or by non _ governmental armed groups deprives them of a normal education and their protective family environment ; this has a direct impact on their development and is at variance with the provisions of article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which states that States parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child 's physical , mental , spiritual , model and social development . 
The present document is an analytical summary of the main points to which ICRC attaches special importance and which it has endeavoured to address in recent years , namely , minimum age of recruitment , minimum age of participation in hostilities , the notions of direct and indirect participation , the notions of armed conflict and hostilities , compulsory recruitment and voluntary enlistment , and armed groups .  
However , this criterion must be linked with the preceding one , since such control must be sufficient to enable the armed group or dissident forces to conduct sustained and concerted military operations and to implement the Protocol .  
On the other hand , it should be understood that such operations must not be sporadic and that they are planned or prepared by organized armed groups capable of taking concerted action .  
FITDH urges the working group on a draft optional protocol to fix the minimum age for recruitment into armed forces at 18 in respect of compulsory service as well as voluntary enlistment , since in many cases a minor 's decision to enlist in the armed forces is anything but free , being dictated by various circumstances , such as poverty , coercion , insecurity , a broken home or lack of alternatives , and parental consent is not enough of a guarantee .  
It was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriot people and the bi-communal order that led to division on the island when the Turkish Cypriot people were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legitimate Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
The delegation of Cyprus had given an accurate and alarming picture of the situation prevailing in the Turkish occupied area of northern Cyprus , where the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Greek Cypriot population were being systematically violated , as they had been throughout the 23-year presence of the Turkish armed forces on the island .  
Recognizing that the reintegration of former combatants and demobilized members of the armed forces continues to be one of the most complex aspects of the social and economic commitments , and that the sustainability of any such programme is linked to broader challenges , such as poverty relief , generation of employment , social integration , public security and efficient , transparent and speedy administration of justice ,  
In 1996 , a number of African countries encountered special development situations with the collapse of public and social services , disruption of economic activities , insecurity and armed conflict , the breakdown of law and order , massive population displacement and widespread human suffering .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Appeals to all Governments to ensure that all persons deprived of their liberty are treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person and that conditions in places of detention conform to the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and , where applicable , in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Protocols thereto in relation to the treatment of prisoners in armed conflicts , and other pertinent international instruments ;  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
Strongly urges all the Afghan parties to work and cooperate fully with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the establishment of a democratic government elected through free and fair elections , to be held throughout the country and based on the right to self _ determination of the people of Afghanistan ;

On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 26 May 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , giving details of the aerial violations that have accompanied the fresh incursions into Iraq 's territory by the Turkish armed forces and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and to halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 31 May 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , giving details of the aerial violations that have accompanied the fresh incursions into Iraq 's territory by the Turkish armed forces and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and to halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
The Committee also notes the major problems experienced as a consequence of the armed conflict , which has imposed serious hardships on the entire population , including heavy casualties , long _ lasting physical , emotional and psychological effects , and the disruption of some basic services .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing due to a number of complex factors which include , inter alia , armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources , and environmental degradation .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 12 June 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , giving details of the aerial violations that have accompanied the continuing incursion into Iraq 's territory by the Turkish armed forces and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and to halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
With the advance of the Allied Democratic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo ( ADFL ) in eastern Zaire and the consequent elimination of rear bases of armed Hutu rebels close to the Burundi-Zaire border , the security situation in Burundi gradually improved during the first months of 1997 , though strong pockets of rebels remained within the former Zaire ( now the Democratic Republic of the Congo ) near Fizi , Kalemie and Moba - enabling them to launch operations against targets in Burundi , including the Government 's military strongholds of Bururi and Makamba provinces .  
John Deutch , former Director of Central Intelligence , confirmed to Peter Jennings that the intelligence operative who was in charge of organizing the armed attack in March 1995 informed his superiors about the schemes which he was preparing and implementing in the north of Iraq , as well as about the CIA payment of $ 6 million to former Iraqi army officers for supporting this base operation and the secret introduction into Iraq of highly sophisticated transmission equipment making direct communication with the CIA possible . 
Deeply concerned by the numerous reports from a large number of reliable sources attesting that , regardless of human dignity , armed groups of religious extremists , who act in flagrant violation of the principles of tolerance of Islam , are terrorising civilian populations in order to force them to support their cause , by resorting , inter alia , to summary executions , the cruelty of which adds futile suffering to the fate of innocent victims of decapitation or throat cutting , including old people , women and children ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
Some of the most intractable armed conflicts being dealt with by the United Nations are those in which a recurring cycle of violence , an erosion of political legitimacy and a loss of economic viability have deprived a State of its authority to cope either with the causes or the consequences of the excessive accumulation , proliferation and use of small arms and light weapons .  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
These include international solidarity and burden-sharing ; effective measures to ensure that refugees are admitted , identified and separated from armed elements ; locating camps at a safe distance from borders ; and ensuring rapid and secure access by UNHCR and other relevant humanitarian organizations to persons of concern . 
Furthermore , arms sales to south Cyprus also constitute a violation of the 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider " the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts " and are obliged to " avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region , or otherwise contribute to regional instability " .  
The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , adopted on 15 September 1995 by the Fourth World Conference on Women , held at Beijing from 4 to 15 September 1995 , refers to coercive economic measures in a section on strategic objectives and actions concerning women and armed conflict . 11 Under strategic objective E . 3 , paragraph 145 contains , inter alia , the following provisions regarding actions to be taken by Governments and international and regional organizations : 
The threats posed by weapons of mass destruction are far from being extinguished , and the consequences of miscalculation or deliberate acts can be horrific , as we know from the terrorist activities of a cult group armed with nerve gas in Japan , biological and toxin weapons in Iraq and persistent reports and risks of nuclear smuggling .  
Their ultimate sacrifice reminds us that human beings are capable of great altruism in the face of suffering and of calm when faced with the destructive passion of armed conflict , even at the risk of their own lives .  
It seems illogical , and indeed morally indefensible , to suggest that armed forces are free to engage in behaviour against citizens of their own country which would be outlawed were they involved in military operations abroad .  
The International Committee was currently developing a model manual for use by armed forces , which would serve as a reference tool for military commanders to incorporate the norms of humanitarian law into the operational decision-making process .  
Belgium accepted only a minimum age of 18 for ( a ) direct or indirect involvement in hostilities ; ( b ) voluntary or involuntary recruitment both by the armed forces and by non _ governmental armed groups .  
During the 1980s , the region experienced its longest period of elected Governments and constitutional processes , reduced military spending , and the acceptance by the armed forces of civilian governmental authority .  
Gravely concerned that the continuation of armed conflicts in the continent threatens regional peace , causes massive human displacement , suffering and poverty , perpetuates instability and diverts scarce resources from long-term development ,  
Gravely concerned that the continuation of armed conflicts in the continent threatens regional peace , causes massive human displacement , suffering and poverty , perpetuates instability and diverts scarce resources from long-term development ,  
For non _ international armed conflicts , the elements of the offence are only met when the combined violations of penal provisions rise to the level of denying indispensable judicial guarantees recognized by all civilized peoples .  
From 1963 , the Turkish Cypriots have been forced to live in scattered enclaves across the island under deplorable conditions , faced with harsh economic restrictions and besieged by hostile Greek Cypriot armed elements .  
His delegation was also deeply concerned about the illegal arms trade carried on by organized criminal groups , which increased the likelihood of international and internal armed conflict and resulted in the destruction of national structures and cultures .  
In its advisory opinion , the Court ruled that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the international law applicable to armed conflict and , in particular , the principles and rules of humanitarian law .  
The existence of many internal armed conflicts , some of them attributable to ethnic mistrust and resistance , which extend to the regional level and in which the warring parties resort to the hiring of mercenaries to boost their military potential ;  
It recommends that the State party raise the legal minimum age of voluntary enlistment into the armed forces in the light of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
They included , for example , poverty , gender discrimination and the difficulties faced by children in need of special protection , whether institutionalized , living in the streets , involved in armed conflicts or substance abuse , exploited and abused , etc .  
Both parties to the armed conflict have disregarded the rules of international humanitarian law , particularly the rebels , who display unusual cruelty which is reminiscent of the massacres committed during the so _ called war of liberation against the Hutu refugees and which the Special Rapporteur , the joint mission of the Commission on Human Rights and the Secretary _ General 's Investigative Team were prevented from investigating .  
. . .  This destructive process has been hastened by the close links that have been established among the armed groups , the armies of losers , which proliferate throughout central Africa , and of which the former Rwandan government forces are the most violent , well armed , well organized and dangerous ( para .  91 ) .  
In an era when ethnic conflict and civil war have become increasingly common in comparison to international armed conflicts , the responsibility of a new Government to pay for past violations may require a specific guiding principle , which should be incorporated in the guidelines .  
Urges States to uphold the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and settlements , inter alia , through effective measures to prevent the infiltration of armed elements , to identify and separate any such armed elements from refugee populations , to settle refugees in secure locations and to afford to the Office of the High Commissioner and other appropriate humanitarian organizations prompt , unhindered and safe access to asylum-seekers , refugees and other persons of concern ;  
As the independent expert pointed out in her two previous reports , as long as the warlords , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their fight in Somalia , and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law relating to non _ international armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia , irrespective of whether a specific area is engulfed in active fighting or not .  
The optional protocol aims to strengthen the existing international standard contained in article 38 of the Convention by raising the minimum age limits for recruitment into armed forces and participation in armed conflict .  
As we know full well , current armed conflicts almost always reflect historical accumulations of unsatisfied demands , in most cases aggravated by inadequate social and economic situations and by international political and economic conditions .  
At the normative level , it is important to emphasize that , despite the specific nature of today 's armed conflicts , the international community seems to have at its disposal a sufficient arsenal of legal instruments to protect civilian populations .  
There is a common thread running through the preceding statements that makes unequivocally clear one of the characteristics of the recent armed conflicts that have led to political or military action by this Organization : the fact that their first and principal target has been the civilian population , in particular its most vulnerable sectors children , women , the elderly , the sick , refugees and internally displaced persons .  
Canada has always distinguished itself by an honourable , consistent and outstanding involvement in United Nations efforts to achieve international peace and security , in particular by its humanitarian devotion to alleviating the suffering of civilian populations in armed conflicts .  
The second level is a complex one that involves a specific mechanism consisting of various interrelated elements , ranging from the body of international humanitarian norms and provisions to the agencies authorized to ensure the rights of the civilian population in situations of armed conflict and to provide humanitarian assistance for them , and so on . 
The main method , if it can be put that way , of conducting so-called combat operations during contemporary armed conflicts is ethnic cleansing , whereby a part of the territory of a sovereign State is cleansed of its local population , who , in turn , become displaced persons and virtual refugees on their own soil . 
The real test of States as to the seriousness they attach to international humanitarian law comes when they face clear and immediate threats to their national security and nonetheless demonstrate a decisive determination to educate their armed forces , to incorporate their legal processes and to retain transparency in order to protect the rights of civilians in armed conflict .  
Urges all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , to ensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel in conformity with the relevant provisions of international law and national laws , so as to allow them to perform efficiently their task of assisting children ;  
In many countries currently engulfed by war and internal conflict , adjustment-induced social unrest provided the initial impetus for ethnic , tribal , religious fundamentalist and nationalist frenzy which eventually led to armed conflict . 
Meanwhile , we must let the rest of the world understand the real nature of this conflict - that this is not just another internal conflict in some small and distant developing country , but an armed rebellion , externally inspired and maintained , against the people of Sierra Leone and their democratically elected Government .  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the increasingly ethnic and religious nature of the conflict , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
In the light of the provisions and principles of the Convention , especially the principles of the best interests of the child ( art . 3 ) and the right to life , survival and development ( art . 6 ) , the Committee expressed its deep concern at the early legal minimum age of voluntary enlistment into the armed forces and recommended that the State party raise the age in the light of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
The countries of the region , aware that poverty prevented many children in developing countries from exercising their right to education and development , had set themselves priorities in the areas of education , health , food and nutrition and specific targets for children and adolescents in need of special care , such as children who worked or engaged in marginal activities , street children and children who were disabled , abused , orphans or victims of armed conflicts .  
The deterioration of the human rights situation is the result of the worsening of the armed conflict and the failure by the Government to implement effective legislative , administrative and other measures , such as those intended to combat paramilitary activity and impunity or to protect human rights advocates .  
They expressed their grave concern at the renewed outbreak of hostilities in the Congo following the perpetration of acts of destabilization by armed groups , causing huge losses of life and material damage and hindering the implementation of commitments undertaken by the authorities to take measures to promote national reconciliation , rebuild the country and relaunch the democratic process .  
They recognized that unusual and massive movements of populations , particularly in the aftermath of armed conflict in certain countries of the subregion , constituted a grave threat to domestic peace , and urged each Government to manage migratory flows more effectively and efficiently and to better control their borders .  
Thirdly , the provisions of article 4 , especially those exempting from the scope of the draft convention activities of armed forces [ of a State ] during an armed conflict , were used to sustain a questionable exception which had the effect of recognizing an alleged right of such forces to use and traffic in nuclear or radioactive material , on the pretext of the exercise of official duties and inasmuch as [ such activities ] are governed by ( . . . ) international law .  
Articles 212 and 213 of the Constitution stipulate that the armed forces are obedient , professional and non-political , and shall not deliberate in matters of service , and that their structure , legal regime , doctrine , composition and functioning are defined by the law , regulations and special provisions which the President of the Republic may adopt .  
Therefore , international efforts to bridge the gap between developing and developed countries should be intensified through the implementation of an information strategy on aspects of globalization relating to social justice and the understanding among peoples that strengthened assistance to developing countries , vulnerable population groups and the victims of armed conflicts , human rights violations and natural disasters . 
The overall situation at the end of 1998 was characterized by continuing armed conflict , the political crisis resulting from lack of agreement on the framework for durable peace , the continuing violations and denial of human rights and the deteriorating humanitarian situation , affected by the absence of international personnel of the United Nations agencies as well as others engaged in humanitarian work , and the reduction of resource flows .  
The main topics discussed by the working group during the general discussion on questions relating to the draft optional protocol included the minimum age for participation in hostilities , the issue of direct or indirect involvement in hostilities , the age of recruitment , be it voluntary or compulsory , into armed forces , and the possibility of including a clause to prevent child recruitment by non-governmental armed groups .  
Second , it was important to understand that , in addition to international instruments , the value systems of individual societies represented another basic means of protecting children in armed conflicts , since one of the main objectives of any society had always been the protection of children , who were its most vulnerable members .  
It should be borne in mind that the current situation of millions of children in many parts of the world remained critical as a result of poor economic and social conditions , poverty , armed conflicts , the exploitation of child labour and the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography , and that the number of children infected with HIV / AIDS had risen at an alarming rate .  
In a country torn by an internal armed conflict to which international humanitarian law is applicable , an official is dismissed .  
When the Democratic Republic of the Congo 's painful transition to independence in the 1960s saw the birth of the first armed militias , political leaders , including those in the United Nations , did not gauge what the refugee problem would become 40 years later , with refugee camps transformed into military training and arms-supply facilities , compromising any good-faith attempt to provide humanitarian assistance to vulnerable affected populations .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
To enact and , where necessary , reinforce or amend penal , civil , labour and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of violence , whether in the home , the workplace , the community or society , in custody or in situations of armed conflict , and to ensure that they conform with relevant international human rights instruments and humanitarian law ;  
That the rights of the child as laid out in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law are at their most pertinent in time of armed conflict , expresses grave concern at the numerous damaging effects of armed conflicts on children and emphasizes the need for the world community to focus increased attention on this serious problem with a view to alleviating those effects ;  
The induction of lightly armed international civilian security officers and additional local watchmen has further augmented the existing internal security arrangements .  
Protocol I additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions , relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts , article 35 , paragraph 3 : " It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended , or may be expected , to cause widespread , long-term and severe damage to the natural environment " .  
The persisting armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering , forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
Refrain from any interference , direct or indirect , individual or collective , in internal and external affairs falling within the national competence of individual States , regardless of their mutual relations , and that they shall refrain from any form of armed intervention or threat with armed intervention against another member State , as well as from undertaking political economic or other coercion ;  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
To enact and , where necessary , reinforce or amend penal , civil , labour and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of violence , whether in the home , the workplace , the community or society , in custody or in situations of armed conflict , and to ensure that they conform with relevant international human rights instruments and humanitarian law ;  
Protocol I additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions , relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts , article 35 , paragraph 3 : It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended , or may be expected , to cause widespread , long-term and severe damage to the natural environment .  * E / 1999 / 100 .  
That the rights of the child as laid out in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law are at their most pertinent in time of armed conflict , expresses grave concern at the numerous damaging effects of armed conflicts on children and emphasizes the need for the world community to focus increased attention on this serious problem with a view to alleviating those effects ;  
The Commission welcomes the reduction in the number of human rights violations attributed to the armed and security forces and the police , but is concerned that the armed forces have not fulfilled their intention to suspend from active service all those in their ranks who are under formal juridical or disciplinary investigation for human rights violations until guilt or innocence is determined and to dismiss them where such allegations have been proven .  
Women with mental disabilities are particularly vulnerable , while there is limited understanding , in general , of the broad range of risks to mental health to which women are disproportionately susceptible as a result of gender discrimination , violence , poverty , armed conflict , dislocation and other forms of social deprivation . 
The general human rights climate has also been worsened by the accompanying wave of protests and demonstrations , some of them violent and destructive of private property , and by the heightened sense of insecurity springing from an increase in threats and acts of intimidation , and by the spates of armed crime , acts of violence and assassinations or attempted assassinations , some of them possibly politically motivated .  
In that context , it continued to be concerned about the damaging effects of armed conflict on Afghan children , who were the victims of incessant hostilities and abhorrent treatment by the Taliban on ethnic and religious grounds .  
The need for humanitarian responses to address the special reproductive health needs of girls and women , including those arising from pregnancy as a result of rape , sexual mutilation , childbirth at an early age or infection with sexually transmitted diseases was emphasized and gender-sensitized education programmes for armed forces and civilian police were called for .  Specific dangers faced by girls in conjunction with child labour were highlighted .  
While noting some signs of greater political freedom in East Timor , these sources reported that East Timorese continued to be persecuted , arbitrarily arrested or routinely harassed for the peaceful expression of their convictions or because they were suspected of supporting the armed resistance .  
A staff member , other than one recruited specifically for a mission , who has completed one year of satisfactory probationary service or who has a permanent appointment and who is called upon to serve in the armed forces of the State of which the staff member is a national , whether for training or active duty , may be granted special leave without pay for the duration of such military service , in accordance with terms and conditions set forth in appendix C to these Rules .  
While pointing out that peace was a prerequisite for development , a number of delegations stated that , in recent years , armed conflict had exacted and was continuing to exact a heavy toll on human settlements and human settlements development and several called on the Centre to provide reconstruction assistance to countries and regions afflicted by armed conflict and natural and man-made disasters .  
This includes regular army and naval forces , armed civilian groups , associated paramilitary groups , air forces , national guards , border police , army reserves , military police , intelligence services , federal and Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs local , special , riot and anti-terrorist police , and any other groups or individuals so designated by the international security force ( KFOR ) commander ;  
These included the bringing of armed civilian groups under strict control and the prompt arrest and prosecution of those who incited or threatened to use violence , a ban on rallies by armed groups , the redeployment of Indonesian military forces , the immediate institution of a process of laying down of arms by all armed groups to be completed well in advance of the holding of the ballot and the freedom of association and expression of all political forces and tendencies .  
Despite an increasing awareness of the problem , however , many refugees were once again exposed to cross-border attacks , forced recruitment into armed fighting forces and confinement in remote , isolated and perilously located camps .  
Mechanisms were also to foster national reconciliation , such as the Truth Commission , whose mandate was to shed light on the most relevant cases of human rights violations , the ad hoc committee responsible for purging the armed forces and the Peace Commission ( COPAZ ) , which was responsible for safeguarding and ensuring compliance with commitments undertaken to promote assistance and community development , mainly in the agricultural sector .  
Paragraph 1 does not apply to international obligations which are expressed or intended to be obligations of total restraint even for States engaged in armed conflict or acting in self-defence , and in particular to obligations of a humanitarian character relating to the protection of the human person in time of armed conflict or national emergency . 
Owing to the uncontrolled crossing-over of armed groups of Albanian terrorists and bandits , systematically abusing , intimidating , abducting and killing non-Albanian populations and looting , stealing and destroying their property , as well as making forced entries into people 's homes , burning churches and places of worship , there followed a massive exodus of Serbs and Montenegrins from Kosovo and Metohija .  
Firmly announces that all foreign military recruits to be captured by the armed forces of the Islamic State of Afghanistan will be considered as criminals and would be directed to the security authorities of the State for prosecution and punishment in accordance with Afghanistan 's criminal code of 1976 , which prescribes severe punishment against those who are committing crimes against the internal and external security of the State ;  
The Security Council 's increased concern for the plight of civilians in armed conflict has been reinforced by the frequent briefings it has received on the humanitarian situation in countries affected by conflict , and is further illustrated by the establishment by the Council of international ad hoc criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda . 
The combined effects of this and of ongoing armed conflicts and several devastating natural calamities had a disproportionate effect on the most disadvantaged groups of society , also contributing to increased feminization of poverty .  
Such personnel , installations , material , units or vehicles were entitled to that protection given to civilians or civilian objects under the international law of armed conflict and the accused was aware of the factual circumstances that established that protection .  
UNICEF has also widely disseminated a conceptual framework on UNICEFs human rights approach , a discussion paper on indicators for global monitoring of child rights , a paper on human rights for children and women , a series of animated child rights cartoons , and will release throughout 1999 a series of working papers compiling the relevant international standards in relation to children in armed conflict , girls , child labour and sexual exploitation .  
UNICEF has actively publicized its view that it is unacceptable that a clear ban on childrens recruitment has not yet been imposed on the direct and indirect participation in hostilities of children below 18 years of age , regardless of whether they have been forced to join armed forces , or whether they appear to have done so voluntarily ; this applies equally to governmental and non-governmental forces .  
Such action is needed in order to enhance international and regional security ; reduce the risk of armed conflict , political violence , terrorism and violent crime ; combat and suppress the illicit trafficking in small arms ; promote sustainable peace settlements and good governance ; and , above all , stop human suffering . 
" The Security Council is deeply concerned that countries involved in , emerging from , or close to protracted armed conflicts are particularly vulnerable to violence resulting from the indiscriminate use of small arms in armed conflict .  
With respect to the preliminary issues of the applicability of article 2 of the Statute of the Tribunal and the grave breaches regime laid down in the Geneva Conventions of 1949 , the Trial Chamber held that an " international armed conflict existed in Bosnia and Herzegovina " and that the victims of the alleged offences were " protected persons " within the meaning of the Geneva Conventions .  
General Blaki _ is charged with grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity on the basis of his alleged responsibility as a superior in respect of the serious violations of international humanitarian law committed by members of the armed forces of the HVO against Bosnian Muslims in the area of central Bosnia during the period from May 1992 to January 1994 .  
While mercenaries may be recruited , trained and financed from within solid , stable countries , they are in fact used chiefly in countries affected by political violence , internal armed conflict , insurrection or insurgency and lacking the necessary financial or technical capacity to exploit their natural resources on an industrial scale .  
Without obviating the need to clarify , refine , update and expand the rules of customary international and treaty law to combat mercenary activity , it should be established as a principle that , in essence , the aim of such rules is to condemn mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the humanitarian standards that apply to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
The persistence of mercenary activities , the range and variety of the forms in which they are carried out and the hidden networks of complicity behind them suggest that States , particularly the smallest and weakest ones , the least developed , those forming archipelagoes , those with valuable natural resources but fragile political systems and those faced with armed insurrection and internal conflicts , are not adequately protected against mercenarism in its various forms .  
It expressed concern at the grave situation created in Gabon by the massive influx of refugees from warring neighbouring countries and again appealed urgently to the United Nations , particularly the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , and to the international community to provide assistance to Gabon with a view to meeting the varied needs of the refugees and helping the country to stem the danger posed by the entry of armed refugees into its territory .  
We are confident that with disinterested assistance by the international community the Government of Indonesia will be able to bring the situation under control through tangible efforts including control of the armed elements , maintenance of security and extension of humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of the refugees and the disadvantaged civilians with the help of the International Red Cross .  
Expressing its deep concern at the erosion in respect for international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and principles during armed conflict , in particular deliberate acts of violence against all those protected under such law , and expressing also its concern at the denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need ,  
Underlining the importance of the widest possible dissemination of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and of relevant training for , inter alia , civilian police , armed forces , members of the judicial and legal professions , civil society and personnel of international and regional organizations ,  
My delegation participated in that debate , and therefore I will confine myself to repeating here that my country is convinced of the importance of raising to 18 years the minimum age for recruitment be it voluntary or mandatory , by regular armed forces or armed opposition groups and for direct or indirect participation in armed conflicts .  
That decision means that the Security Council will start to be involved in the protection of civilians in armed conflict as an implementation mechanism of the international community to enforce international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions , which until now , as stressed by previous speakers , have often been ignored , unsatisfactorily implemented , seriously violated and abused ; their violators have not really been brought to justice . 
It is truly regrettable that , despite quite a number of basic instruments in international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law which provide for the essential legal protection of civilians in armed conflict , the gross violations of their rights around the world have not yet ceased .  
Recognizing the critical role played by many other United Nations and non-United Nations bodies and humanitarian agencies in protecting civilians in armed conflict and in providing them with humanitarian assistance and all necessary relief , we stand by our position that the Security Council should be the guiding and coordinating organ in these international efforts .  
We also join the call to move away from double standards in the field of human rights , and we believe that the same attention should be devoted to those situations , wherever they may arise , that involve a loss of civilian life in armed conflict or which are a source of untold suffering , without allowing the political considerations of Council members , and especially of the permanent ones , to prevail over the collective considerations of the Council and of the United Nations as a whole .  
From traditional society to our modern world with its elaborate written laws , it has always been understood that persons who are not involved in combat during an armed conflict should not be subject to attack .  
Expressing its deep concern at the erosion in respect for international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and principles during armed conflict , in particular deliberate acts of violence against all those protected under such law , and expressing also its concern at the denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need ,  
Underlining the importance of the widest possible dissemination of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and of relevant training for , inter alia , civilian police , armed forces , members of the judicial and legal professions , civil society and personnel of international and regional organizations ,  
After over three decades of an internal armed conflict marked by extreme cruelty , a conflict which was , among other things , an expression of profound and deep-rooted political and ideological intolerance , all the indications were that reintegrating the former guerrillas was going to be a complicated and dangerous process .  
The armed intervention and the decisive role played by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The Hague , brought to bear in defence of the principles of humanity and human rights , seem to foreshadow a strengthened determination on the part of the international community to enforce respect for the fundamental values of justice and human dignity that inspired the San Francisco Charter .  
Arms transfers and trafficking , and the resulting armed conflicts which they feed , are having a devastating impact on social , political and economic life for Africa south of the Sahara , a region endowed with natural resources but which still has pockets in which live the poorest people in the world today . 
The Security Council is deeply concerned that countries involved in , emerging from , or close to protracted armed conflicts are particularly vulnerable to violence resulting from the indiscriminate use of small arms in armed conflict .  
My report to the Security Council on the protection of civilians in armed conflict ( S / 1999 / 957 ) , which was considered by the Council in September , contains detailed proposals on the legal and physical protection of civilians to enhance compliance with international humanitarian law and human rights law during armed conflict .  
Everyone is aware that this trade has contributed to intensifying and prolonging armed conflicts in Africa , and to further complicating peacekeeping efforts by impeding economic and social development in certain regions of the continent .  
The tasks of the United Nations force would be to maintain a secure environment throughout the territory of East Timor , to provide direct security for United Nations personnel and property , to monitor the prompt and complete withdrawal of any remaining Indonesian military and security personnel , to take measures to disarm and demobilize armed groups and to assist humanitarian activities as appropriate , including the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons .  
Strongly condemn the exploitation of our wealth and the wicked destruction of human lives of which the country is a victim by all the foreign armed forces , above all Rwandan and Ugandan , who one day or another will leave us with a country that has been bled dry , exploited , plundered and ruined ;  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
I would like to emphasize that it was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriots and the binational order that led to the division of the island when the Turkish Cypriots were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legal Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of girls and boys in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions in an increasingly globalized world economy , pandemics , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , discrimination and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Emphasizing the importance of the end of a critical period in Central American history and the start of a new phase free from armed conflict , with freely elected Governments in each country and with profound political , economic , social and other changes which have created a climate conducive to the promotion of economic growth and further progress towards the consolidation and further development of democratic , just and equitable societies ,  
Mr . Christian Tomuschat , the Commissions Coordinator , detailed its main conclusions and recommendations the fruit of a year and a half of work on the human rights violations and acts of violence which occurred during the internal armed conflict .  In its conclusions , the Commission stated that at least 83 per cent of the victims were Mayan and attributed institutional responsibility for 93 per cent of the violations to agents of the State , principally members of the army .  
An organized group of heavily armed individuals , claiming to represent local residents , broke into the offices of the Izabal Banana Workers Union , threatened union leaders that they must give up the Union and their jobs at BANDEGUA , forced them to call off the union mobilization planned for the next day and compelled them , on pain of death , to leave the area with their families .  
Condemns the widespread violations and abuses of human rights and humanitarian law , including the rights to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religion , association and movement , the forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict and , in particular , the grave human rights violations against women and girls ;  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the ground of ethnicity ;  
In the framework of the ongoing internal armed conflict , serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and large-scale breaches of international humanitarian law have forced a growing number of individuals and entire communities to leave their homes .  
Participants concluded that while the underlying causes of displacement in Colombia are multiple ( the internal armed conflict , land disputes , large-scale development projects , etc . ) , violations of human rights and humanitarian law are most often the immediate cause of displacement .  It was therefore argued that a drastic improvement in respect for human rights in Colombia would be the most effective way to prevent displacement .  
Having concluded that displacement is the result of violations of human rights and humanitarian law , workshop participants went on to discuss how internal displacement is not only the result of armed conflict but a strategy to militarily control disputed areas populated by communities perceived as supporters of the enemy .  
In Africa , in particular , children were all too often the victims of armed conflict , a situation aggravated by natural disaster , disease , an adverse economic environment and the growing burden of foreign debt , while in Palestine and other occupied territories , children were being killed , tortured and imprisoned without having committed any crime .  
The tasks of the United Nations force would be to maintain a secure environment throughout the territory of East Timor , to provide direct security for United Nations personnel and property , to monitor the prompt and complete withdrawal of any remaining Indonesian military and security personnel , to take measures to disarm and demobilize armed groups and to assist humanitarian activities as appropriate , including the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of girls and boys in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions in an increasingly globalized world economy , pandemics , natural disasters , armed conflict , displacement , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , discrimination and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Urges States to uphold the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and settlements , inter alia , through effective measures to prevent the infiltration of armed elements , to identify and separate any such armed elements from refugee populations , to settle refugees in secure locations , and to afford to the Office of the High Commissioner and other appropriate humanitarian organizations prompt , unhindered and safe access to asylum-seekers , refugees and other persons of concern ;  
Stressing the importance of adherence to international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law in order to avert mass exoduses and to protect refugees and internally displaced persons , and expressing its deep concern at the lack of respect for those laws and principles , especially during armed conflict , including the denial of safe and unimpeded access to the displaced ,  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 2 December 1999 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , concerning a fresh act of aggression carried out by Turkish armed forces in the territory of northern Iraq on 23 November 1999 that constitutes a flagrant violation of Iraq 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and poses a grave threat to its national and regional security . 
Further to my letter dated 17 November 1999 addressed to you ( S / 1999 / 1188 , annex ) , I should like to draw your attention to the fact that on 23 November 1999 units of the Turkish armed forces consisting of two brigades supported by armoured cars and the forces maintained in the area following previous hostile operations carried out a fresh act of aggression against the territory of northern Iraq .  
Each State Party shall review its declaration ( s ) under article 2 on an annual basis , with a view to the possibility of increasing the minimum age that it applies for the voluntary enlistment of persons into its national armed forces and for the participation of such persons in armed conflict , and shall deposit any declaration ( s ) accepting higher standards when applicable .  
Condemns the widespread violations and abuses of human rights and humanitarian law , including the rights to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religion , association and movement , the forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict and , in particular , the grave human rights violations against women and girls ;  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity ;  
At the impact of the current armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and continuing serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all parties , in particular :  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the last few years , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
The delegations supporting its inclusion favoured a broad definition , as it would be conducive to the control of such trafficking , and noted that , while some of the listed devices were more likely to be used in armed conflicts or by terrorists , they were still likely to be trafficked by persons engaged in transnational organized crime .  
Article 10 of the Act states : The Regulations pursuant to this Act shall establish the grounds for complete or partial exemption from service in the armed forces , indicating the physical , moral or social impediments thereto and the manner in which they must be verified .  
According to the information received by the Special Rapporteur and the observations he has made during his various missions , mercenary activities continue to be carried on both through traditional means of recruitment and hiring and in new forms , including recruitment by private companies offering military security services , which take part in armed conflicts in specific countries by virtue of contracts signed with Governments .  
The Working Group was informed by several non-governmental organizations that members of the armed and security forces accused of having committed enforced or involuntary disappearances and other grave human rights violations in previous decades had not been brought to court .  
The Special Rapporteur , in an addendum to her report , on country situations ( E / CN . 4 / 1999 / 39 / Add . 1 ) , stated that she had received numerous allegations concerning extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions committed by armed insurgent groups in Sierra Leone .  
Such personnel , installations , material , units or vehicles were entitled to that protection given to civilians or civilian objects under the international law of armed conflict and the accused was aware of the factual circumstances that established that protection .  
Such personnel , installations , material , units or vehicles were entitled to that protection given to civilians or civilian objects under the international law of armed conflict and the accused was aware of the factual circumstances that established that protection .  
The military authorities specifically reiterated their public pledge not only to support the ongoing peace and democratic processes but also to transform the armed forces into a more professional republican army subordinate to civilian authorities following the elections .  
It is further alleged that , in contrast to the improved situation in the north of Uganda , armed clashes in the west of Uganda between the UPDF and the insurgent Allied Democratic Front ( ADF ) , which have also involved the abduction and forcible recruitment of children , have intensified since June 1997 .  
ICRC suggested that many purposes could be envisaged : a document meant to facilitate the dissemination of the relevant norms , an instrument aimed at clarifying the substance of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflict , a text aimed at clarifying the responsibility of non-State actors , or a document aimed at bridging the gap ( if one existed ) between international humanitarian law and human rights law in situations of internal violence .  
According to Turkey , the content of fundamental standards of humanity should be limited to international human rights law and not include international humanitarian law , as they concerned situations of internal violence which did not reach the threshold of an armed conflict .  
Over the last 50 years , and especially since the end of the cold war , the decrease in the number of international armed conflicts has been offset by an increase in the number of civil wars and other situations of internal violence , which are characterized by massive and systematic violations of human rights .  
Taking the opportunity offered by Articles 10 and 11 of the Charter , my delegation would also like to make all the Members of our universal Organization aware of the genuine motives behind the armed aggression that the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its peace-loving people are suffering and to ask them to contribute to the establishment of a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict that is currently tearing my country apart .  
In response , the sponsor delegation pointed to the numerous international organizations and other bodies and entities involved in the provision of humanitarian assistance and stressed the importance of not interfering with their operational procedures and the inadmissibility of using armed force in the provision of humanitarian assistance , which might paralyse the work of international humanitarian organizations and institutions or nullify such activities .  
This policy has also included the organization and support of armed groups ; air and naval raids against our territory ; the hatching of over 600 plots to assassinate the leader of our revolution ; a military invasion by a mercenary army ; the most serious threat ever of a global nuclear conflict , in October 1962 ; and finally , a brutal commercial and financial blockade and a ferocious economic war against my country that have now lasted 40 years .  
Special mention should be made of our Bolivar 2000 plan , an initiative of the Presidency of the Republic to provide resources and professional and logistical capabilities from the armed forces to the population in order to establish an integrated social-service programme aimed , inter alia , at the provision of timely assistance to meet the peoples basic needs and at rehabilitating the social infrastructure .  
While it goes without saying that we have a legal obligation to abide by relevant international law , it is also true , regrettably , that compliance with international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict needs to be further improved in the wake of numerous violations of such norms .  
Political , social and economic transformation now present us with a Central America free from armed conflict , a Central America with strengthened democratic institutions and a Central America in which peace , the protection of human rights and regional integration have been established on a solid footing .  
Ecuador attaches the utmost importance to the Ottawa Convention , because we are convinced that it strengthens and improves upon the principles of international humanitarian law that are applicable to armed conflict , consolidates respect for disarmament conventions , especially those relating to controls on conventional arms that have especially harmful and indiscriminate effects , and , in particular , fosters and strengthens peace .  
This year , as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions and the one hundredth anniversary of the Hague Conventions , armed conflicts in many parts of the world , including the Great Lakes region , Angola , Sierra Leone , East Timor , the Balkans and Caucasia , have given rise to frequent and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
In effect States should undertake additional measures , such as stepping up efforts to eliminate anti-personnel mines , combating the excessive stockpiling and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons , addressing the fate of children involved in armed conflicts , protecting and assisting internally displaced people and ensuring the rapid entry into force of the Statute of the International Criminal Court .  
This year such issues include the dumping of nuclear waste and other toxic substances , the regional seas programme of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , the increasing threat to shipping from piracy and armed robbery at sea , the importance of enhancing the safety of navigation and the continued work of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization towards a convention on the protection of the underwater cultural heritage .  
These included reduction of the infant mortality and under-five child mortality by one third and of maternal mortality by half , cutting down by 50 per cent the number of children under five suffering from malnutrition , enabling every child to attend primary school , immunizing 90 percent of the worlds infants and protecting children in especially difficult circumstances , particularly in situations of armed conflict .  
The armed conflicts that have for years been tearing apart the Horn of Africa and Central Africa have resulted in thousands of deaths , orphans , refugees and displaced persons in brief , an unprecedented humanitarian disaster compounded by the collapse of economic and social and , sometimes , political infrastructures .  
As we approach the end of this century , which surely will be remembered as the one in which mankind developed and used its most powerful weapon yet , the nuclear weapon , we must lay the foundation for a new collective consciousness directed towards the quest for peace and security by means other than armed confrontation , and give thought to the realities and contradictions involved in the disarmament process .  
The Committee regrets that its dialogue with representatives of the State party regarding the root causes of the armed conflict was inconclusive ; the absence in the report of statistics relating to the north and east of the country can only reinforce the view of the Committee that the question of discrimination in relation to the economic , social and cultural rights of ethnic groups remains the central issue in the armed conflict in Sri Lanka .  
The Committee is fully aware of the human and material costs of the armed conflict in Sri Lanka and the deleterious effects this has on the economic , social and cultural rights of every person living in the country .  
The advisory opinion also emphasized that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the requirements of international law applicable in armed conflict , particularly those of the principles and rules of international humanitarian law .  
In the current international context , characterized by growing interdependence and globalization , it is essential for Member States to show greater political will by intensifying dialogue and joint undertakings and strengthening international cooperation through confidence-building measures , which can reduce tension and the risk of armed confrontation between States .  
At the initiative of Burkina Faso , joint military exercises , entitled Kompienga Unity 98 , for the purpose of training personnel for peacekeeping operations was held from 16 to 21 April 1998 ; the armed forces of Benin , Burkina Faso , Cte dIvoire , Ghana , the Niger , Nigeria , Togo and Chad had taken part in the exercises , in which a great deal of attention had been given to humanitarian issues .  
While the Special Rapporteur recognizes the difficulties that the concerned Governments face in fighting armed insurgent groups , she notes with concern that in some countries Governments have adopted counter-insurgency strategies , often involving excessive and indiscriminate use of force , aimed at targeting those suspected of being members , collaborators or sympathizers of those groups , leading to further violations of the right to life .  
In this respect , my delegation commends the timely advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice which asserts that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international humanitarian law applicable to armed conflicts .  
Legislative Decree No . 895 of 1998 , enacted to combat organized crime by armed groups , punishes as a perpetrator of aggravated terrorism ( even if it is an ordinary offence ) any member or accomplice of a criminal group who carries firearms or explosives to commit any offence against life , physical integrity , health , property , individual freedom or public security , even if the perpetrator acts alone .  
Reforms were needed to protect the rights of the child : education must be improved , childrens courts must be reformed , the practice of recruiting minors to the armed forces must be stopped , hazardous child labour must be prohibited , and the sexual exploitation of children ( who were often exposed to infection by the human immunodeficiency virus ) must be combated more effectively .  
Hiring private companies providing security and military assistance and advice is no substitute for maintaining a collective regional security system and genuinely professional national armed forces and security forces loyal to the democratic legal order.It is a false solution . 
Without obviating the need to clarify , refine , update and expand the rules of customary international and treaty law to combat mercenary activity , it should be established as a principle that , in essence , the aim of such rules is to condemn a mercenary act in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the humanitarian standards that apply to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
Specifically , it is neither lawful nor advisable , no matter how often short _ term or emergency reasons are invoked , to entrust a country ' s security and the speedy settlement of armed conflicts to private companies which hire mercenaries to achieve those objectives and will earn substantial economic profits for their participation .  
At its fifty _ fourth session , the Commission , in resolution 1998-75 , recognizing the urgent need for the adoption of effective measures , nationally , regionally and internationally , to protect the civilian population , especially women and children , in northern Uganda from the effects of armed conflict , requested the Secretary _ General to report on the implementation of that resolution to the Commission at its fifty _ fifth session .  
In some areas , the police make special raids on Roma communities - armed assaults in the early hours of the morning , during which houses are searched , the contents ransacked , inhabitants , including women , the elderly and children , harassed or subjected to excessive force , and men rounded up for arrest and questioning , usually without search and arrest warrants .  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
Numerous testimonies received by the Special Rapporteur indicate that the civilian population living in or near the combat zone is generally forced to move : in these " grey zones " ( zones controlled or influenced by the insurgents ) the armed forces often resort to searches , destruction and burning of houses , and confiscation of property and food to force the people to move , temporarily or permanently .  
At a public sitting on 8 July 1996 , the International Court of Justice recognized for the first time in history that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict , and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law , also recognizing that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament .  
This is why we will not support proposals that are designed to subordinate respect for human rights in the context of armed conflict , in accordance with international humanitarian law , to questionable military requirements .  
The introduction to the Principles contains a refinement of previous working definitions : internally displaced persons are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence , in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict , situations of generalized violence , violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters , and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
Strongly deploring the rising toll of casualties among humanitarian personnel and United Nations personnel in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , and strongly condemning the acts of physical violence and harassment to which those participating in humanitarian operations are too frequently exposed ,  
The persisting armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering , forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
The laundering of money accruing from illegal drug trafficking , and the use of such money in order to finance illegal activities , such as providing financial support for armed rebel movements that threatened legitimate Governments , posed a threat to international peace and security and made it essential for the international community to cooperate with the relevant international bodies . 
The Nordic countries considered that the primary rules had now been codified in the major fields of international law , including treaty law , diplomatic and consular law , human rights law , the law of the sea and humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts .  
Stressing the importance of adherence to international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law in order to avert mass exoduses and to protect refugees and internally displaced persons , and expressing its deep concern at the lack of respect for these laws and principles , especially during armed conflict , including the denial of safe and unimpeded access to the displaced ,  
At the impact of the current armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , at continuing serious violations of human rights , and international humanitarian law by all parties , in particular :  
This political partnership for peace deserves to be supported , especially since through negotiations it is involved in negotiations specifically with the armed and unarmed outside opposition to arrive at an overall peace agreement on which future transition institutions will base themselves to prepare a state of law respectful of human rights and of democratic freedoms .  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Concerned also that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 2 December 1999 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , concerning a fresh act of aggression carried out by Turkish armed forces in the territory of northern Iraq that constitutes a flagrant violation of Iraq ' s sovereignty and territorial integrity and poses a grave threat to its national and regional security . 
I should like to draw your attention to the fact that on 23 November 1999 units of the Turkish armed forces consisting of two brigades supported by armoured cars and the forces maintained in the area following previous hostile operations carried out a fresh act of aggression against the territory of northern Iraq .  
When , after the end of the cold war , the world seemed to be developing towards a promising situation because of the gradual reduction of interState conflicts , the African continent suddenly fell victim to armed confrontations of unprecedented violence .  
Indeed , today more than ever , conflictprevention must become a global and integrated strategy to ensure in the long term not only the absence of armed conflict , but that conditions remain conducive to political , economic , social and cultural peace .  
These include local and regional armed conflicts , growing indebtedness , rampant poverty , scarcity of financial resources , and the spread of dangerous diseases such as HIV / AIDS and malaria .  
To come together in order to counter the evil role played by diamonds in armed conflict is an excellent , irreproachable initiative , because this illicit trade is prejudicial to peace , particularly in Africa .  
They build on the fundamental norm of the law of armed conflict that military necessity in armed conflict has to be constantly set against the humanitarian objective of preventing unnecessary suffering .  
There has been an increase in violent conflict , in particular , intraState armed conflict , often rooted in political transition , economic dislocation , fragile civil society and a weakening of the State .  
That was demonstrated by the current social unrest in Benin ( varying from a merciless pursuit of armed gangs of looters to a widespread strike of civil servants ) , which was rooted in the economic problems linked to the countrys underdevelopment .  
The new spiral of fierce armed resistance begun by the Taliban has led to a worsening of the suffering of the Afghan population and to new flagrant violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law .  
The interstate wars of the Cold War years had been succeeded by intrastate armed conflicts , often underpinned by political transition , economic dislocation , weak civil society and a weakening of the State , leading to virtual anarchy .  
Some also expressed concern that not requiring that military firearms be marked and recorded would make them untraceable if they later fell into nonmilitary possession as a result of loss in armed conflicts , theft or other diversions .  
The increasing challenges posed by poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions and situations of armed conflict must be confronted with determination if the rights of children and of future generations were to be protected .  
The Council further stressed the importance of a coordinated international response to economic , social , cultural or humanitarian problems , which are often the root causes of armed conflicts .  
It was agreed that the organization should enhance its capacity to predict and respond to a changing global environment , marked by increased frequency and intensity of civil strife , armed conflict and natural disasters .  
Formidable challenges arising from persistent poverty and widening economic and social disparities , humanitarian crises caused by armed conflict and natural disasters , and the growing HIV / AIDS pandemic provided the context for much of UNICEF work in 1999 .  
Bearing this in mind , Russia is open to a broad dialogue aimed at reaching agreement on specific ways to mobilize the additional potential of international political and legal means for the protection of civilians in armed conflict .  
We are greatly concerned by the fact that genocide , ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of human rights have not only become linked to modern armed conflicts , but , in manner of speaking , have developed into just another way of waging war .  
Some also expressed concern that not requiring that military firearms be marked and recorded would make them untraceable if they later fell into nonmilitary possession as a result of loss in armed conflicts , theft or other diversions .  
These problems may include geographical and demographical problems , poor institutional setups , ethnic tensions ( 18 African LDCs have been involved in armed conflicts since independence ) and weak , often dualistic , product markets .  
On the technological level , new weapons research and development has continued unabated , with the emergence of more accurate nuclear ballistic missile systems and the deployment of highly accurate nuclear armed cruise missiles .  
It is generally recognized that the modern world is still characterized by the persistence of armed conflicts , which continue to cause human losses and mass violations of human rights , as well as economic , social and cultural devastation .  
If the political will is summoned to deny the ability of warring factions to sustain their illicit trade in natural resources , a vital lifeline that supports and sustains armed conflict will be degraded , if not destroyed .  
The international community should make any assistance political , diplomatic , financial , material or military to parties to armed conflict contingent on their observing standards for the protection of children .  
In contrast , a very large poor and indigent population excluded and lacking social cohesion can coexist with privileged professionals who receive benefits from public transfers , such as the armed forces or unionized workers in finance and banking .  
However , the tragic murder in August of seven Afghan workers of the United Nationssupported mine awareness programme by an unidentified armed band in western Afghanistan confirmed the everyday risks faced by humanitarian personnel .  
All this is accompanied by the establishment of illegal armed formations , blatant interference from abroad in the affairs of sovereign States and the creation of new hotbeds of tension , leading increasingly to the largescale loss of innocent lives .  
While we understand that armed conflict may occur within States , we do not agree to limiting the concept of prevention to intra-State conflict , given that continuing , potentially explosive regional and international situations require major efforts to prevent them from erupting into global armed conflicts .  
National Governments and local authorities are called upon to respond properly and in a timely fashion to the political , economic , social and humanitarian circumstances that have the potential to lead to armed conflict or to the intensification of an ongoing conflict .  
The constraints imposed by severe poverty on economic development and social progress in some developing countries , combined with other factors , such as ethnic and territorial dispute , have caused disturbances , and even armed conflict , in these countries .  
Despite the efforts of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to facilitate recovery , the people there continue to suffer , with admirable courage , the vicissitudes of a long political transition process that is having a devastating effect on economic structures , as well as the ravages of two successive armed conflicts that have hampered the speedy reconstruction of the country and of the social infrastructure , which has been hard hit by the years of crises . 
We also recommend that positive consideration be given to the Secretary-Generals practical and action-oriented recommendations , in particular those that are targeted at enhancing the capacity of national Governments and the international community to prosecute violations of international humanitarian law ; improving engagement by the Security Council and others with a view to obtaining access to vulnerable populations for humanitarian operations ; and developing clear criteria and procedures for the identification and separation of armed elements in situations of massive population displacement .  
In an act of international solidarity that is commensurate with existing needs , the international community must commit itself to helping the Democratic Republic of the Congo , particularly through the appropriate resumption of multilateral and bilateral structural cooperation , as well as by providing access to various debt-relief mechanisms , including the facilities enjoyed by countries emerging from an armed conflict under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative .  
Second , Jamaica supports the steps proposed by the Secretary-General to enhance his traditional preventive role with respect to : the increased use of United Nations interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions ; to develop regional prevention strategies with regional partners and appropriate United Nations organs and agencies , including the possibility of establishing liaison offices with regional organizations ; to use eminent persons for advice and action in support of preventing and resolving armed conflicts ; and to improve the capacity and resource base for preventive action in the Secretariat .  
The root causes of the armed conflicts in the world today can be found in very complex economic , social , historic and religious issues , as well as in the tribal and territorial problems that are a legacy of colonialism .  
Finally , let me express our hope that the current open debate , focused on the Secretary-Generals report on conflict prevention , will foster the effective implementation of the recommendations contained therein and contribute to the goal of mobilizing the collective potential of the United Nations , its Member States and other international stakeholders in eliminating the threat of the emergence of armed conflicts .  
In this respect , the presence of political leaders who are prepared to handle social complaints and demands by violent means with a view to satisfying selfish political and economic ambitions is the real cause of , and an inevitable catalyst of , social violence and armed conflicts .  
In Zaire and in Haiti , the armed conflicts resulted from the actions of hardened , corrupt , dictatorial governments that turned their backs on the civilian population and established violence as the norm of political discourse and squandered national resources .  
It reiterates its position that the primary responsibility for the continued fighting lies with the leadership of the armed faction of the Unio Nacional Para a Independencia Total de Angola ( UNITA ) headed by Mr . J . Savimbi , which is refusing to fulfil its obligations under the Accordos de Paz ( S / 22609 , annex ) , the Lusaka Protocol ( S / 1994 / 1441 , annex ) and relevant resolutions of the Security Council , which remain the only viable basis for political settlement of the conflict in Angola .  
After the disengagement phase has been successfully completed , there will be numerous complex tasks ahead in the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in terms of moving forward the disarmament and demobilization of the armed groups and achieving the withdrawal of foreign forces from the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Although we believe that the main responsibility for bridging this gap and implementing international rules aimed at protecting children in armed conflicts lies above all with national Governments , we are also fully convinced that the international community has an important role to play in providing the necessary technical and financial support to protect , reintegrate and psychologically rehabilitate children .  
The consequences of war , acts of genocide , armed conflicts , family violence , international terrorism , organized crime , and trafficking in humans and drugs , as well as weapons of mass destruction and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , have devastating consequences for children and a profound impact on their lives and their communities .  
While the Government of Burundi is satisfied by the conclusions of the Panel of Experts concerning charges pertaining to the alleged involvement of Burundi in the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , the delegation of Burundi is , however , concerned by information contained in certain paragraphs of the addendum regarding assistance granted to the armed groups Forces pour la dfense de la dmocratie ( FDD ) and Forces nationales pour la libration ( FNL ) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . 
That can become a reality only if coercive and firm measures are taken against the FDD and FNL armed groups , which have stepped up their violent actions against the innocent population since the establishment of the transitional Government , and which no longer have any political justification for turning a deaf ear to appeals for negotiation and ceasefire . 
The ongoing series of hostile operations and the flagrant violations of Iraqs territory and airspace that are being committed by the Turkish armed forces only confirm Iraqs repeated warnings against the consequences of the duplicitous policy being pursued by Turkey vis - - vis the anomalous situation in northern Iraq and against Turkeys participation in perpetuating that situation by open interference in the internal affairs of Iraq .  
The long series of armed conflicts in Africa inevitably involving mercenaries organized in various ways offers harsh and brutal proof of the fact that the real and effective exercise of the right of many African peoples to self-determination has not been realized .  
However , a glance at the present pattern of armed conflicts , whether internal or international , and the fact that mercenaries are involved in most of them would seem to confirm the opinion held by the Office of the Special Rapporteur , namely , that mercenary activities are continuing in many parts of the world and that the presence of mercenaries is still connected with situations that affect the self-determination of peoples as well as peace , political stability , life , physical integrity , freedom and security .  
The aim of the rules of customary international and treaty law is , in essence , to combat mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to prevailing standards of international humanitarian law applying to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
She further notes with regret that in some countries Governments have made use of excessive and indiscriminate force in their efforts to counter armed opposition groups , which in some cases has involved summary executions of captured combatants and resulted in extensive civilian casualties and fatalities .  
These developments have contributed to improving protection of individuals in all situations through , for example , the elaboration of the rules applicable in internal armed conflict , the establishment of individual criminal responsibility under international law for violations of laws applicable to all armed conflicts and the clarification of the conditions under which a State may be held responsible for acts by non-State entities .  
Mines and other sources of natural wealth are remote and heavily guarded , often located in areas subject to outbreaks of fighting or armed attacks against the local population .  
Determined to alleviate the plight of populations in the regions of the world besieged by armed conflicts and criminality , which are fuelled by illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , in a manner that would bring the benefits of social and economic development and national , regional and international stability ,  
Develop and adopt effective programmes for the collection , safe storage , destruction and responsible disposal of firearms rendered surplus , redundant or obsolete through , inter alia , peace agreements , demobilization or integration of ex-combatants or re-equipping or restructuring of national armed forces or armed State bodies ;  
The political instability and the natural resources of certain countries , by exciting the greed of foreign interests which had allies in the interior of the country , lay at the origin of the numerous armed conflicts in that continent .  
It should also be noted that serious offences against international humanitarian law , as defined in the Criminal Code , are much more severely punished when members of the armed forces are accused , and acts formerly treated as ordinary crimes are also covered .  
The success of a number of civic movements in winning mayoral elections , the appointment of a Guambian governor in the Department of Cauca - the first indigenous ethnic minority-group representative ever to be elected - and , in general , the maintenance of democratic institutions in a context of internal armed conflict all bear witness to the unbending will of the Government and the State in general to respect political rights .  74 .  There have also been many large demonstrations calling for peace and protesting against violations of fundamental rights .  
In view of the unstable security situation in the country and in order to avoid potential security gaps related to the continuing repatriation of ECOMOG troops , significant resources were utilized for the transportation by air of contingent-owned equipment , stores and supplies , as well as for the strengthening of UNAMSIL air operations capability by enhancing its helicopter fleet with armed military helicopters and commercial heavy-lift rotary aircraft .  
To regularly review the stocks of small arms and light weapons held by armed forces , police and other authorized bodies and to ensure that such stocks surplus to requirements are clearly identified , [ and that programmes for the responsible and expeditious disposal , normally through destruction , of such stocks are established and implemented ] and that such stocks are adequately safeguarded until disposal .  
How was it possible for children to fully enjoy their rights to education , to a healthy childhood , to play and recreation , and to healthy development in other words , all the rights to which they were entitled as human beings when they were confronted daily with the appalling consequences of armed conflict and foreign occupation , when they lacked even the most basic needs and when their very protection and survival were at stake ?  
Tribute should be paid to the organizations of the United Nations system , Governments and the international community , especially non-governmental organizations , for the work they were doing to help , at both the psychological and the physical level , millions of children living in abject circumstances because they were victims of poverty , a precarious economic or social situation , sickness , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , disabilities or lack of legal protection .  
It was therefore imperative that the relevant activists in political and civil society , including parents , teachers and religious and community leaders , should join hands to revive the traditional safeguards for women and children by creating a culture of respect for diversity and promoting peaceful coexistence among all sections of society .  Pakistan hoped that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict would go a long way to addressing that issue .  
According to the statistics , which were distressing , as a result of armed conflict some 2-million children had died , and countless numbers had been wounded , orphaned , traumatized , displaced or maimed by landmines , forcibly conscripted into armed groups , abducted or abused ; the situation was further compounded by the abundance of small arms and anti-personnel landmines .  
Despite the existence of an array of international legal instruments to protect children in armed conflict , the human rights of children continued to be violated with impunity ; there was clearly a need to reverse the trend from blatant disregard to strict observance of those instruments .  
Appeals to all Governments to ensure that all persons deprived of their liberty are treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person and that conditions in places of detention conform to the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and , where applicable , to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 in relation to the treatment of prisoners in armed conflicts , as well as to other pertinent international instruments ;  
Given the vehement and heroic resistance of the Iraqi armed forces , and foremost among them the valiant air defence forces , to this brutal aggression , the United States and the United Kingdom have resorted to a crude method of breaking the legitimate resistance of Iraqis , namely dropping from the air on Iraqi towns and villages leaflets cautioning the Iraqi armed forces against engaging the attacking United States and British aircraft and threatening to destroy sites that orient their radar systems or from which fire is directed in order to oppose these aircraft .  
While the plan for the withdrawal of all foreign forces awaits completion , I am confident that continued implementation of the Lusaka Agreement and the Kampala / Harare disengagement plans , further bilateral contacts and a joint commitment to address the issue of the armed groups in the eastern provinces constitute the surest way of achieving a lasting settlement and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Recalling the inclusion of gender-related crimes and crimes of sexual violence in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ( A / CONF . 183 / 9 ) , which affirms that rape , sexual slavery , enforced prostitution , forced pregnancy , enforced sterilization and other forms of sexual violence constitute , in defined circumstances , a crime against humanity and / or a war crime , and reiterating that acts of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict can constitute serious violations or grave breaches of international humanitarian law ,  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
Condemns violence against women committed in situations of armed conflict , such as murder , rape , including systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , and calls for effective responses to these violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ;  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of the persistence of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions in an increasingly globalized world economy , pandemics , in particular HIV / AIDS , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , discrimination , disability and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Calls upon all States to protect refugee children , unaccompanied children seeking asylum and internally displaced children , who are particularly exposed to risks in connection with armed conflict , such as recruitment , sexual violence and exploitation , to pay particular attention to programmes for voluntary repatriation , and wherever possible , local integration and resettlement , to give priority to family tracing and reunification , and , where appropriate , to cooperate with international humanitarian and refugee organizations ;  
In 2000 , several set-backs and longstanding problems impeded progress for children , such as persistent poverty , high debt burdens of many developing countries ( despite some debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPCs ) , the still-expanding HIV / AIDS pandemic , armed conflicts , and natural disasters in Afghanistan , El Salvador , India and Southern Africa .  
These two countries are using armed force on a daily basis against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq in the two no-flight zones that they imposed by their unilateral decision , and these two countries are supporting , funding and training terrorist groups for the purpose of undermining Iraqs security and threatening its territorial integrity . 
I am also concerned at the deterioration in public security , reflected in an increase in crime , in actions by armed criminal groups and in the continuing very serious threats against persons involved in criminal proceedings and intimidation of members of non-governmental human rights organizations .  
The recent surge in these activities by Pakistan , however , is a mere supplement to its widespread presence in Afghanistan , as Pakistan maintains thousands of military personnel , non-commissioned officers , armed nationals belonging to numerous Pakistan-based extremist organizations and volunteers from religious schools called the Madrassa , fighting alongside the Taliban mercenaries .  
It also points to two defining elements of the philosophy underlying the collective security system : first , preventing armed conflict is a more desirable and cost-effective strategy to ensure lasting peace and security than trying to stop it or alleviate its symptoms ; and second , armed international conflicts are best prevented by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security are not endangered , as provided for in Article 2 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter .  
A Framework team , composed of senior representatives of 14 departments , agencies , programmes and offices , including the World Bank , meets monthly to exchange information from their respective areas of competence and to assess the potential for armed conflict , complex emergencies or other circumstances that may provide a prima facie case for United Nations involvement .  
Apart from the shared feature that their host countries were not involved in a violent internal or international conflict , the common features included the possibility , or even the likelihood , of armed conflict , consent of the States concerned to the peacekeeping operations as the form of prevention , and the authorization of the operation by the Security Council .  
Efforts to prevent armed conflict should promote a broad range of human rights , including not only civil and political rights but also economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development .  
From 31 August to 7 September 2001 , the World Conference Against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance will discuss many of the issues linked to racial and ethnic conflicts , and I hope that it will make concrete recommendations , including on early warning systems , confidence-building measures and structural and institutional support mechanisms to prevent the deterioration of ethnic tensions into armed conflict .  
By 2003 , have in place national strategies to address the spread of HIV among national uniformed services , where this is required , including armed forces and civil defence force and consider ways of using personnel from these services who are educated and trained in HIV / AIDS awareness and prevention to assist with HIV / AIDS awareness and prevention activities including participation in emergency , humanitarian , disaster relief and rehabilitation assistance ;  
It is , moreover , well-understood that the illegal use of force in international relations will be considered under customary international law , international human rights and humanitarian law , the law of armed conflict and international criminal law .  
This legal / political controversy , however , belongs not in the debate on terrorism but in debates on which provisions of humanitarian law apply - those governing civil wars or those governing wars identified in article 1.4 of Additional Protocol I . [ 109 ] That debate would have to take into account , of course , the principle of self-determination , as set out in the Charter of the United Nations , human rights instruments and resolutions , with regard to the armed conflict in question . 
The occupying power may , then , invoke its long occupancy as proof that its occupation is legitimate and characterize any and all use of force against it as terrorism . [ 115 ] ( b ) There is a situation of nascent civil war - i.e . , a situation where there are armed groups who either do not control sufficient territory , or who engage in military activities that are more than sporadic but less than sustained , or whose actions do not qualify as military actions under the laws and customs of war . 
Many years had to elapse and great human and material resources had to be expended for the world to realize something that should have been an obvious truth ; that the early identification of trends leading to crises and the timely forestalling of their development into armed clashes are much more effective in every respect than extinguishing conflicts in their heated phase .  
I am referring to the need to elaborate , under United Nations auspices , a comprehensive strategy in this field that would encompass a whole range of problems , including some that are already being addressed by the international community , such as the problems of conflict diamonds , the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , combating the drug trade and the training of mercenaries and the financing of illegal armed groups .  
A recent study by the Center for International Development and Conflict Management at the University of Maryland , based on a study of 160 countries , has concluded that armed conflicts decreased in number and intensity by about half in the 1990s , the number of democratic Governments has vastly increased and the number of power-sharing agreements to end ethnic fighting has also increased .  
The term countermeasures covers that part of the subject of reprisals not associated with armed conflict , and in accordance with modern practice and judicial decisions the term is used in that sense in this Chapter . [ 3 ] Countermeasures are to be contrasted with retorsion , i.e . unfriendly conduct which is not inconsistent with any international obligation of the State engaging in it even though it may be a response to an internationally wrongful act . 
To ensure , subject to the respective constitutional and legal systems of States , that the armed forces , police or any other body authorized to hold small arms and light weapons establish adequate and detailed standards and procedures relating to the management and security of their stocks of these weapons .  
To regularly review , subject to the respective constitutional and legal systems of States , where appropriate , the stocks of small arms and light weapons held by armed forces , police and other authorized bodies and to ensure that such stocks declared by competent national authorities to be surplus to requirements are clearly identified , and that programmes for the responsible disposal , preferably through destruction , of such stocks are established and implemented and that such stocks are adequately safeguarded until disposal .  
Only those who are brainwashed enough to believe that ends justify means are capable of regarding a total of more than 230 armed attacks killing 70 innocent people , including 31 Turkish diplomats , and wounding 524 civilians as individual acts ; and only those , I would like to add , can claim such unabashed defence of evil .  
The Armenian falsifiers would rather prefer to claim that if any single Turk was killed during these tragic times , then that was strictly due to self-defence , that no civilian Turks were murdered , raped or pillaged whereas even the Tsarist officers were horrified to see the frenzy of massacring defenceless Turks perpetrated by armed Armenian gangs and paramilitaries in the most vicious manner .  
ICRC , the organization charged with systematically defending and developing international humanitarian law , argues that armed conflict is one of the key reasons for the lack of food and violations of the right to food , yet the international debate on the right to food has made little reference to international humanitarian law . 23 ICRC argues that humanitarian law contains many provisions that relate to the protection of access to food in armed conflict situations and must therefore be seen as an essential component of the legal framework that protects the right to food . 
The Ministers expressed their serious concern for the threats to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Macedonia in recent months by ethnic Albanian extremist groups , strongly condemning their terrorist acts and armed violence and calling on these groups to stop their actions , to release the hostages , to lay down their weapons and to withdraw immediately from the occupied areas .  
The heightened attention of the Council to the situation in Burundi was dictated by the rapidly deteriorating military situation in the country at the end of February and the beginning of March and the increased violence , including the attacks by Burundian armed groups on the capital .  On 2 March , the Council members , during consultations of the whole , heard a briefing by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Kieran Prendergast , on the current political , military , humanitarian and socio-economic situation in Burundi and developments in the Arusha peace process in the past months .  
It has been generally recognized within the international community that the excessive accumulation and circulation and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons pose a global threat to peace and security .  The ready availability of small arms contributes to the intensification of armed conflicts and to increased levels of violence .  
In that connection they pointed out that States had an obligation to exercise control so as to prohibit security firms from participating in armed conflicts , creating private armies , engaging in illicit arms trafficking , being involved in the illegal extraction of natural resources and , in that context , employing mercenaries .  
With greater support from the General Assembly and the Commission , the Special Rapporteur will thus be enabled to continue to investigate such phenomena as the role of mercenaries in internal or international armed conflicts affecting the right of peoples to self-determination and at the same time to consider other phenomena in which mercenaries have a criminal involvement , such as illicit trafficking , terrorism and the formation of mercenary teams by private security companies , which use them to intervene in the internal affairs of States with which the companies sign contracts .  
All this may give rise to interference by mercenaries who , motivated by payment , may commit terrorist acts , attacks against persons , cultural objects or economic facilities , engage in illicit trafficking , or provoke armed or other conflicts with a view to carrying out violent and destabilizing assignments which have a profound impact on the enjoyment of human rights .  
The currently accepted meaning or use of the term mercenary is primarily focused on including in this rubric the hiring of the professional services of persons with a military background who are paid to intervene in an armed conflict in a country other than their own .  
In such a culture , Governments would live up to their responsibilities , armed groups would respect the recognized rules of international humanitarian law , the private sector would be conscious of the impact of its engagement in crisis areas , and Member States and international organizations would display the necessary commitment to ensuring decisive and rapid action in the face of crisis .  
In a multi-faction conflict , such as that in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , experience has shown that , in order to gain meaningful and regular access to vulnerable populations within different combat zones , where front lines are shifting from day to day , the consent of many parties has to be obtained at the local , regional , national and international levels .  They may include a range of armed groups and other non-State actors with often diverse or obscure political , economic and strategic goals .  
Member States are nevertheless still reluctant to support the work of humanitarian agencies in these circumstances , because of the perceived security risk to their military personnel and the risk of further exacerbating the conflict by direct confrontations with armed elements .  Ensuring security in camps requires the involvement of police and military forces , not least in disarming and demobilizing militias and transferring them to different sites .  
I would therefore like to recall the prohibition against targeting civilians and conducting indiscriminate attacks on civilians , enshrined in customary international humanitarian law , which is binding not only on States and their Governments but equally and directly so on armed groups that are parties to the conflict , as stated in article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 . 
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
The forms of conflict most prevalent in the world today are internal communal violence , ethnic cleansing , terrorism , private wars financed by the international trade in diamonds or oil and involve a proliferation of armed groups .  
I encourage the Security Council to conduct more frequent fact-finding missions to conflict areas with a view to identifying the specific requirements for humanitarian assistance , in particular obtaining safe and meaningful access to vulnerable populations .  In view of the prevalence of civil wars among todays conflicts , a structured dialogue with armed groups is indispensable for reaching and protecting vulnerable populations in times of war ( see paras . 30-32 and 48-50 ) .  
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
At its fifty-seventh session , in April 2001 , the Commission on Human Rights adopted , without a vote , resolution 2001 / 13 on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan , in which it strongly condemned the mass killings and systematic human rights violations against civilians and persons deprived of their liberty , for reasons related to the armed conflict , resulting in the massive , forced displacement of the civilian population .  
It also noted with deep concern the continuing pattern of human rights violations in Afghanistan and the continuation of armed hostilities and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which had resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement .  
In view of the repeated massive violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Afghanistan , the High Commissioner called upon the international community to establish an independent international inquiry into the massacres and other grave human rights violations committed by parties to the armed conflict in Afghanistan .  
The armed conflict in the north and the south-west , which forced most of the countrys development projects to a halt , and the unstable social and political situation prevailing in Ethiopia and Somalia have accelerated the deterioration of the Djiboutian economy .  
The Permanent Mission of the Republic of San Marino to the United Nations would like to point out the fact that , given the characteristics of the San Marino armed forces , the Government of the Republic of San Marino deemed it inconvenient to fill out the questionnaire [ entitled Instrument for standardized international reporting of military expenditures ] and preferred to send the attached sheet of information .  
The end of the internal armed conflict and of an institutional policy that violated human rights represented a qualitative and quantitative improvement .  
Attacks against the civilian population and systematic killings and summary executions have been a part of the pattern of egregious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law perpetrated by different factions in the protracted armed conflict in Sierra Leone .  
Recalling that the fundamental rights of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups must be respected in all circumstances and that deliberate policies discriminating against women and girls in that country on the grounds of sex constitute gross and flagrant violations of the international instruments relating to human rights ,  
Considers it essential that the international community continue to follow very closely the situation of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups and bring the necessary pressure to bear so that all the restrictions imposed on women , which constitute flagrant and systematic violations of all the internationally recognized economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , are removed ;  
Encourages continued United Nations activities aimed at promoting the fundamental rights of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups , and supports their efforts to create a humanitarian framework within which humanitarian operations can be conducted in a calm environment in the utmost safety and to induce the Taliban to comply with the provisions governing the conduct of such operations ;  
The Committee reminds the State party that even during armed conflict , fundamental human rights must be respected and that basic economic , social and cultural rights as part of the minimum standards of human rights are guaranteed under customary international law and are also prescribed by international humanitarian law .  
The Security Council underlines the importance of practical disarmament measures in averting armed conflicts and encourages States and relevant international and regional organizations to facilitate the appropriate cooperation of civil society actors in activities related to the prevention and combating of the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons , including facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of this problem .  
Collaboration on issues of children affected by armed conflict that are relevant to the special session on children has been extensive and fruitful : the draft outcome document of the special session , on a world fit for children , contains important recommendations for the agenda on children affected by armed conflict , many joint events were convened during the sessions of the Preparatory Committee , and several significant joint initiatives were planned for the special session itself .  
Although weapons of mass destruction are the most threatening of weapons to our societies , in circumstances of civil war and armed conflicts small arms and light weapons have proved to be equally deadly and brutal .  
He also recognizes that progress has been made in addressing a number of historical human rights violations committed by the former government prior to October 2000 , including the release of many political prisoners , investigations into the fate of persons of different ethnic groups missing during the armed conflict in Kosovo in 1999 and criminal investigations into murdered or other disappeared persons .  
Belarus is convinced that a gradual movement from simple to more complex bilateral and multilateral measures and agreements will create a solid basis for preventing armed conflict and strengthening national and regional security , which in turn are integral elements of the modern architecture of a comprehensive and indivisible system of international security .  
Noting with concern the devastating effects of difficult social and economic conditions , armed conflicts , wars , natural disasters , infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria , and of the HIV / AIDS pandemic on family life and stability ,  
He noted with regret that despite all the collective commitments made by heads of State and Government at the various international conferences held over the past decade and in the Millennium Declaration particularly with regard to social development and poverty eradication , national , regional and international challenges to the fulfilment of those commitments , such as armed and civil racial conflicts , genocide , enforced displacement , the proliferation of drugs , organized crime and terrorism against innocent persons were increasing in an unprecedented manner .  
Notwithstanding the fresh hopes for a safer environment brought about by the end of the cold war , the world has experienced a proliferation of regional conflicts and armed hostilities , and has witnessed a trend towards the spread and destabilizing accumulation of sophisticated weapons systems , including weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery .  
Many participants stressed that the process of building a democracy that is rooted in a culture of tolerance and respect for diversity was a crucial element in strengthening the capacity of a State to prevent , manage and settle conflicts by peaceful means , given that social exclusion , intolerance and unequal access to vital resources were often at the root of todays armed conflicts .  
As elaborated in my recent report on the prevention of armed conflict ( A / 55 / 985-S / 2001 / 574 and Corr . 1 ) , to be effective a conflict prevention strategy needs to address the multidimensional root causes of conflict through a variety of political , legal , economic and other measures involving the many parts of the United Nations system and incorporating a regional dimension .  
The sides have stated that an essential precondition for the transfer of the resolution of the situation in Afghanistan to the political channel is the unconditional fulfilment of the demands of the anti-terrorist coalition , including the handing-over of those who inspired and organized the terrorist acts of 11 September 2001 in New York and Washington , D.C . , the abolition of the rule of the Taliban , who have provided shelter for terrorist and extremist groups on the territory they control , and the disbandment and complete disarmament of their armed units . 
As a consequence , the plague of hijackings of aircraft in mid-flight soon spread to the United States itself , where , for the most varied reasons , a number of people , most of them unbalanced individuals , adventurers or common criminals , from both the United States and Latin America , began to hijack aircraft , armed with firearms , knives , Molotov cocktails and sometimes just bottles of water made to look as though they contained gasoline , with which they threatened to set the aircraft on fire .  
In Central America we have made great progress , not only in the process of transition involving painstaking work in the area of pacifying , disarming and reintegrating armed groups into civil life , as well as campaigns to promote tolerance and peaceful coexistence and integration into political , social and cultural life but also in creating awareness among our peoples about the need to develop a culture of peace , which is closely related to the promotion of civic and democratic values .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the past few years , in particular in armed conflicts and in post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of the countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
Calls upon all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular in armed conflicts and in post-conflict situations , in countries in which humanitarian personnel are operating , in conformity with the relevant provisions of international law and national laws , to cooperate fully with the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies and organizations and to ensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel in order to allow them to perform efficiently their task of assisting the affected civilian population , including refugees and internally displaced persons ;  
In its preambular part , the draft resolution reaffirms prior resolutions that emphasize and acknowledge the importance of international , bilateral and multilateral economic , financial and technical support , cooperation and assistance for peacekeeping and peace-building in Central America following armed conflict and natural disasters .  
Respect fully international human rights law and international humanitarian law applicable to the rights and protection of women and girls and take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence , particularly rape and all other forms of sexual violence during armed conflict , and end impunity and prosecute those responsible for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , including those relating to sexual and other gender-based violence against women and girls ;  
The direct or indirect sale or provision to the territory of Afghanistan under Taliban control , as stipulated by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 , of technical advice , assistance or training related to the military activities of the armed personnel under the control of the Taliban is prohibited ;  
At the impact of the ongoing armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and at continuing serious violations of human rights , fundamental freedoms and international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict , in particular :  
When ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict , to raise the minimum age for voluntary recruitment of persons into their national armed forces from that set out in article 38 , paragraph 3 , of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , bearing in mind that under the Convention persons under 18 years of age are entitled to special protection , and to adopt safeguards to ensure that such recruitment is not forced or coerced ;  
When ratifying the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict , to raise the minimum age for voluntary recruitment of persons into their national armed forces from that set out in article 38 , paragraph 3 , of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , bearing in mind that under the Convention persons under 18 years of age are entitled to special protection , and to adopt safeguards to ensure that such recruitment is not forced or coerced ;  
Recognize that sexual violence during armed conflict constituting serious violations of international humanitarian law has been used as a tool of systematic forms of discrimination , abuse and genocide directed against racial or ethnic populations of non-combatants , and that race and gender combine to make women particularly vulnerable to certain types of violence , particularly sexual violence ;  
The severe insecurity , which seriously hampers the ability of humanitarian organizations to secure access to affected populations , particularly in the zones held by armed rebels and under the control of foreign forces , while condemning the killing of six humanitarian workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross on 26 April 2001 in Ituri Province , for which those responsible must be brought to justice ;  
At the impact of the ongoing armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effects on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and at the continuing serious violations of human rights , fundamental freedoms and international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict , in particular :  
The situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and particularly in the zones held by the armed rebels and under foreign occupation , and the persistent violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , including the atrocities against the civilian populations , usually committed with complete impunity , while emphasizing in this regard that all the forces present in the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo should be held accountable for the violations of human rights in the territories under their control .  
The severe insecurity , which seriously hampers the ability of humanitarian organizations to secure access to affected populations , particularly in the zones held by armed rebels and under the control of foreign forces , while condemning the killing of six humanitarian workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross on 26 April 2001 in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , for which those responsible must be brought to justice ;  
The severe insecurity , which seriously hampers the ability of humanitarian organizations to secure access to affected populations , particularly in the zones held by armed rebels and under the control of foreign forces , and condemning the killing of six humanitarian workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross on 26 April 2001 in Ituri Province , for which those responsible must be brought to justice ;  
It is reported that the two ethnic groups living in the Ituri region , Hema and Lendu , have been in rivalry for a long time , fighting for land resources and the like .  In recent months , there have been continuous mass armed clashes , causing tremendous casulty and losses .  
At the same time the new Russian military doctrine has conferred on the Russian armed forces the functions of defending the state constitution , and striking at the illegal activities of extremist organizations , organized crime , and terrorism ; the original military doctrine laid down that such tasks should be undertaken by Interior Ministry troops .  
The party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as its core has held high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , unswervingly upheld the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and persistently put ideological and political building in the most important place .  The people 's armed forces have maintained their brilliant image of being mighty and civilized armed forces .  The armed forces are constantly scoring new victories in making themselves more revolutionary , modern and regular .  
This is a valuable conclusion drawn from the experience in the practice of the modernization of our armed forces for several decades , and is the correct choice for speeding up the process of making our armed forces more revolutionary , modern and regular .  
The important speech given by President Jiang at the Plenary Session of the PLA Representative Troops fully affirms the achievements made by the military and armed police troops and raises clear requirements for comprehensively promoting the construction of military modernization .  The speech emphasizes that the military must further clearly understand the historical mission it shoulders and provide firm and strong assurance of security for protecting the country 's sovereignty , unity and security , for protecting the people 's labor under peaceful conditions and for reform , opening up and the construction of socialist modernization .  
The circular urges the officers and men of the entire army and the armed police force to unite more closely round the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , work hard , pioneer the way forward , and usher in the new century with a brand-new outlook and outstanding achievements .  
The PLA and armed police units are treating the campaign of learning from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun as an important content of their ideological and political education , organizing the officers and men to learn from the advanced deeds of Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun in light of the realities of army building in the new period , and help the officers and men further their understanding of Lei Feng 's and Li Xiangqun 's lofty spirit .  
The PLA and armed police units are treating efforts to strengthen the ideological properties of young officers and men as the most important part of the campaign of learning from Lei Feng and Li Xiangqun ; and are guiding young officers and men to display a " spirit of the nail " [ grasping every available minute and second ] , painstakingly study Deng Xiaoping Theory and materialist dialectics , constantly lay a solid ideological theory foundation , and acquire correct world outlook , outlook on life , and values .  
Sun Yuxi answered that last year , the US-led NATO used force against Yugoslavia , a sovereign country , using the Kosovo issue as an excuse .  This seriously violated the UN Charter and norms governing international relations and set an extremely dangerous precedent of armed intervention in the internal affairs of another country .  
Defense ministers of the five countries exchanged views on the issues of implementing the consensus reached by heads of the five countries , summarizing the situation in executing the agreements on confidence-building in the military sphere and on the mutual reduction of the armed forces in the border areas , strengthening the trustful cooperation in military , political , and security spheres among the five countries , and opposing the national separatism , the religious extremism , and the international terrorism .  After reaching a broad agreement on these issues , they issued a joint communique .  
Adhering to the guiding principle that focuses on unity , stability , inspiration , and positive propaganda , we had a good grasp of the press , broadcast , movie , and television work , armed people 's minds with scientific theory , guided people with correct public opinion , molded people with lofty spirits , and encouraged people with fine artistic works .  
On the basis of its geopolitics and its domestic and foreign " realistic " situation , Russia has gradually formed its own unique " practical containment " nuclear strategy : to prevent the outbreak of a nuclear war and a large-scale conventional war by means of nuclear deterrence and to first use nuclear weapons in a regional war , local war or armed conflict to attain the goal of safeguarding national security and maintaining the status of a big country .  
While urging the international community to exchange experiences , both positive and negative , in promoting and protecting the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups in accordance with the principle of equal treatment , sincere cooperation , and mutual respects , China opposes the practice of exercising armed intervention against other countries by using the nationality issue as a pretext and relying on military superiority and also resolutely opposes the act of carrying out separatist activities under the pretense of safeguarding the rights and interests of ethnic minority groups . 
After the Cold War , peace and development have become major topics that are of common concern to peoples of all nations in the world .  In this situation , Japan has not made more contributions to world peace and development , but has instead used all its armed might to indulge in wars of aggression , expanded its armament without restraint , and attempted to elevate its international status and political and economic interests as a military power .  This obviously runs counter to the historical trend .  
Our military 's scientific and technical strength lags fairly far behind that of the western armed forces , therefore , the scientific and technological resources in the masses of people will be the essential supplement and effective support for our military to win a victory under inferior conditions during a high-tech war .  
Last year , in light of their combat tasks , they again explored such new topics as single-soldier air defense missiles fighting against armed helicopters and tackled bottlenecks in this regard together with an antiaircraft artillery unit .  In light of such characteristics of an armed helicopter as being capable of hovering for a shorter period of time , launching a rapid attack , and so on , they also studied and developed new tactics like continuous shelling , striking specified points , surrounding and annihilating , and so on .  
Leading cadres should use the important concept of " three represents " as a sharp weapon to observe and ponder problems , as the basic criterion for telling right from wrong , and as the basis for making decisions in work ; only thus will they be able to remain sober and steadfast politically , to stand up to various new tests , and to ensure stability and a high degree of centralization and unification in the armed forces and the party 's absolute leadership over them .  
In the face of the " Taiwan independence " forces that are running wild and an adverse international current against China in particular , we must pay close attention to making preparations for a military struggle , keep increasing our defense capacity , do our utmost to realize the peaceful reunification of the motherland and to safeguard our state sovereignty and the interests of the people , and ensure that our armed forces are capable of fighting and winning when the motherland and the people need them .  
Around the two historic questions of how to " fight and win " and how one does " not become degenerate , " we now should emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , smash the trammels of outmoded ideas and the old way of thinking , earnestly study new situations and problems , and explore new ideas , new methods , and new ways to solve major practical problems in the armed forces in order to keep raising the level of army building .  
Leading cadres must do a good job in arming themselves with scientific theories and the knowledge of science and technology , keep improving themselves ideologically and theoretically , and increase their ability to lead the effort to strengthen the armed forces through science and technology and to direct modern warfare in order to keep pace with the times and to adapt themselves to social , economic , and cultural development , to the renewal of weapons and equipment , and to the change of modern warfare .  
We must regard the study and implementation of this important thinking a fundamental approach to and a long-term strategic mission for enhancing party organizations ' cohesion and combat strength , for ensuring the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces , and for accomplishing the two historical tasks of " winning the war " and " preventing degeneration . "  We must make unremitting efforts to study and implement this important thinking so as to improve party building in the armed forces and raise the standards of military construction in all areas .  
In the course of studying the " three represents , " party committees of the armed forces and armed police units at and above the army level felt that party committees and leading cadres not only should act as model practitioners of the " three represents " but they should also shoulder the responsibility of guiding the party committees of subordinate military units in meeting the " three represents " requirements and advance party building in the military units in an all-round way .  
Against such a backdrop , we should give full play to the armed forces ' fine traditions and encourage team efforts to solve problems together .  To achieve research breakthroughs , we should form many cooperative collectives with top-notched scientists as the cores .  This means that we should choose a large number of authoritative , reputable , innovative scientists with supervisory ability to head these collectives and organize and coordinate all quarters to tackle difficult technological issues and carry out large , strategic , frontline , and exploratory projects .  
He stressed the need to reinforce the building of party branches according to the " three represents " requirements , and the fundamental key lies in properly performing the function of exercising political leadership , thus guaranteeing the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces and guaranteeing the fulfillment of all tasks with medical service as the central link .  
Taiwan 's armed forces believe that they are bound to lose in any " decisive battle on their beaches and shores " because Taiwan Island is small , shallow in strategic depth , and lacking a room for maneuver , and with the development of modern weaponry , the Taiwan Strait is becoming less and less effective as a natural defense for Taiwan .  
The core of Taiwan armed forces ' thinking of " decisive battle outside border " is : They will offer tenacious resistance on offshore islands , make timely landing raids on enemy shores , take advantage of the advanced performance of their main naval and air weapons to first impose war on the enemy , let war start on the enemy 's shore , and prevent war from reaching their own " doorstep " .  
Firepower warfare has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  As people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have been added to firepower warfare .  The long-range , accurate , highly efficient , and rapid reaction natures of firepower call for profound changes in the military 's principles and types and methods of fighting , and also set new tests and demands on a country 's war preparations and building of armed forces .  
Therefore , the unit , relying on its own efforts in the face of these difficulties , took the initiative in carrying out coordinated training with a transportation regiment of the military region , a helicopter wing , and a naval test base under the support of the military region 's relevant department .  For the first time in the entire armed forces , it conducted a long-distance three-dimensional maneuver for its troops by four transportation methods - - " sea routes , air links , railways , and highways " .  The maneuver was a success .  
Only by paying close attention to building a contingent of qualified personal as a fundamental task will it be possible for us to implement the grand strategy of strengthening our armed forces through science and technology .  
Meanwhile , military lawyers , as political workers , should consider the ultimate goal of their legal services as one of serving the armed forces ' political and ideological construction and increasing the relevancy and effectiveness of ideological and political work in the new period while performing their professional duties .  
Like their civilian counterparts , the legal affairs that military lawyers have to handle involve those relevant to criminal , civil , economic , administrative , maritime , and financial laws , and so they must be totally familiar with the laws and regulations of the country so that they can properly handle the legal affairs in the armed forces and legal affairs that involve both military and civilian departments ;  
In an area where there were high mountains , steep cliffs , long and deep valleys , thick bushes , and ferocious animals , a " special assault group " was faced with a ruthless battle : It had to accurately find a way out by crossing through a primeval forest as deep as 35 kilometers in the pitch-black night within 11 hours without being discovered by the " enemy " forces , who were armed with all types of modern reconnaissance equipment . 
Sometimes maybe only units of a certain armed service are needed , but usually combined forces including active units and reserve forces are needed " .  " In the meantime , the skills and resources provided by multinational forces , regional organizations , international bodies , non-government organizations , voluntary organizations , and private organizations should be adequately made use of , if possible " , to ensure that the US army 's " non-war military operation " will achieve the intended objective .  
Due to people 's being tired of and paying less attention to the conventional battle with firepower , confusion has emerged in military theory and the study of military theory on fighting with firepower has seriously lagged behind .  The situation will influence our judgment and selection in the types of a future war and affect our understanding and policy-making in the structure and building of the armed forces .  
Fighting with firepower has lasted a long period in the history of modern wars .  When people have entered into the period of high technologies , brand new contents and characteristics have added to fighting with firepower .  The long-range , accurate , highly efficient and rapid reaction natures of firepower call for profound changes in the military 's principle , types and methods of fighting , and also set new tests and demands on a country 's war preparations and building of armed forces .  
This successful exercise , with a landing operation as its backdrop , has showed clearly that the multidimensional combat ability of our army is being enhanced today , as it not only has the means to cope with hard offensives launched by the enemy with such high-tech weapons as cruise missile and armed helicopter ; but also has the right measures to counter soft assaults , such as network attacks , which base on high technologies means .  
Under the new international and internal situations , whether or not the Chinese armed forces can keep pace with the military developments in various parts of the world , can win the high-tech wars that might occur in the future , and maintain the character , true color and work style of the people 's armed forces rest primarily with the construction of party organizations in the armed forces ; and also with the mental state , work style , discipline , organization , fighting capabilities and leadership of party organizations in the armed forces .  
Following the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the Chinese armed forces ' guiding thought for construction underwent a strategic change .  We have reduced the number of personnel , substantially restructured our sizes , drawn up a strategic policy for military affairs in the new period , and achieved the " two fundamental changes " .  The successes we have achieved have attracted worldwide attention .  
During the process of deepening reforms , we must not waver in upholding all the basic rules governing the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces - - such as the rules on the division of military leaders ' responsibilities and the establishment of political leaders and political bodies in the armed forces - - or rules that the supreme leadership and commanding authority belong to the collective leadership of the party Central Committee , the Central Military Commission , and party committees ( party branches ) .  
It is party leaders who drew up the armed forces ' laws and regulations .  They have shaped and standardized the party 's basic principles for the construction of the armed forces , elevated these principles to the level where they become the will of the state , and used mandatory authority to ensure their implementation .  This is specifically an expression of consolidating and strengthening the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces .  
We should focus on current work assignment and future development all at the same time .  We should ensure that our military talents are equipped with one specialty and many supporting skills and that they are capable of performing alternative work assignments and have a basis for future development .  While focusing on cultivating military talents by using all the facilities and resources the armed forces have , we should also be good at encouraging other sectors to run institutions of higher learning .  
Various logistical supports have also been strengthened .  At present , our reserve forces ' rapid mobilization capability and fighting ability have been greatly improved .  Reserve forces have become a strong contingent of the armed forces of our country .  
have transformed our field equipment support , supply , and maintenance structure from one for ensuring separate support , supply , and maintenance for three armed services or different departments respectively into an integrated structure for ensuring support , supply , and maintenance for three armed services at the same time , which is capable of providing joint and regional support for three armed services ; handling repairs at a base ; and ensuring follow-up emergency repairs .  
It has made one innovation after another and has developed " tools for cooking and distributing hot foods " , " water filters for camp and field training " , " mobile barracks on vehicles " , and " oil heaters for cold areas on plateaus " .  It has laid a solid foundation for solving difficult problems that restrain long distance mobile support for the armed forces .  
The regulations fullyreflect the great importance that the CMC and headquarters have attached to the development of military colleges , and their concern and care for their teaching staff .  The regulations certainly will play a positive part in enabling the armed forces to bring in outstanding personnel , retaining the mainstay teachers , stabilizing their ranks , and improving the system of establishing specialized and technical positions , and strengthening college construction in all respects .  
seriously implement the general requirements that all army units must be qualified politically and competent militarily and must have a fine style of work , maintain strict discipline and be assured of adequate logistical support , and comprehensively promote army building ; resolutely abandon formalism and bureaucracy , make great efforts to encourage the style of seeking truth , doing solid work and going deep into reality , properly grasp all aspects of work , and constantly raise the revolutionization , modernization , and regularization of the armed forces to a new level .  
Internationally speaking , the trend of multi-polarization keeps developing , and the world situation generally tends to relax .  However , the world is not peaceful , as the superpower is still pursuing hegemonism , propagating such absurd views as " human rights overriding sovereignty " and " legitimate humanitarian intervention " , or even resorting to armed aggression and expansion .  
They should learn their lofty passion of fighting for the motherland , their fighting will for struggling persistently and their spiritual attainment of continuous pursuit .  Officers and soldiers throughout the military and the armed police forces should , as the athletes have done , work hard in training , make unswerving efforts , be brave in struggling for " gold medals " in their own posts , and accomplish more magnificent achievements for the People 's Republic of China .  
To meet the requirement for " being armed in two aspects " , members of party committees at all levels have continuously intensified their study .  However , in both the range and quality of their study and the conversion and application of the study results , they still fall short of the demand for " winning the war " .  More conspicuous are the inadequate study of military theories and military high-tech knowledge and the lack of versatile personnel .  
The long-standing logistics support pattern , under which the three armed forces had their individual systems and under which barriers existed between different departments and between different regions , was replaced by a joint logistics system , with military regions serving as a foundation .  As a result , logistics support has been put in place in a timely manner , supplies have never been suspended , none have ever been left out or under-supplied , and logistics resources have been reasonably distributed and effectively utilized .  
In 1950-1954 , armaments good for equipping 22 aviation divisions and 64 infantry divisions were purchased from the Soviet Union , with much of the purchased armaments reaching advanced international standards of that time , resulting in an tremendous improvement in the backward state of our armed forces ' armaments and thus laying a solid material foundation for prevailing in the war .  
Early in the War to Resist the United States and Help Korea , suddenly arriving new armaments were strange to many officers and soldiers because officers and soldiers of our armed forces had rather low scientific and educational levels and had all along used rather crude armaments during long years of domestic war .  Thus , in the second campaign , over 2,000 captured automobiles were destroyed by bombings executed by US armed forces because basically no one was able to drive an automobile to a place under cover .  
With the growing high-tech content in modern armaments , there are increasingly high requirements on our armed forces ' officers and soldiers in connection with scientific and cultural knowledge and military technological qualities .  
Therefore , we must scientifically design and plan the work of personnel training in a strategic manner , on the basis of the conditions of our country and our armed forces and objective requirements of future warfare , in an effort to substantially improve the quality of our armed forces ' military personnel quickly and to develop large numbers of high-quality military personnel ready to be used at critical moments .  
The great development of the industrial revolution early in this century made the organization of the military move away from the traditional model of having the infantry ( cavalry ) forces as the dominant forces , with the structure of the military coming to encompass such elements as artillery , armed , engineering , air defense , and naval forces ; the availability and quantities of the new services and arms of the military , characterized by high technological contents , became important indicators of the level of modernization and combat effectiveness of the military .  
Before joining the war in Korea , our armed forces already had artillery , armored , and engineering units , but such units accounted for an extremely small portion of the military as a whole , with the force structure model based on the dominant position of infantry forces remaining unchanged .  
It was because of the recognition of this point that the CPC Central Committee and Central Military Commission timely showed their determination , organizing and strengthening air force , naval and technical army units on the basis of carrying out fighting and force construction simultaneously , and thus achieved the change from a undiversified military into a composite military , thereby greatly improving our armed forces ' force structure and capability for coordinated operations and providing the equipment and technological foundation for prevailing over a strong enemy .  
On this happy occasion , we would like to extend our warm congratulations and cordial greetings to cadres and people of all nationalities and patriotic people from all social sectors of Qamdo and officers and men of the troops of the Chinese People 's Liberation Army , armed police , and public security troops stationed in Qamdo and our to all revolutionaries of the older generation and retiring comrades who had contributed to the stability and development of Qamdo .  
Faced with the most vicious aggressors who were armed to the teeth and under the circumstances of fighting an extremely brutal war , the officers and men of our army fought in a dauntless-heroism spirit of conquering all enemy and all difficulties .  They crossed ice-covered lands , slept on snow-covered areas , fought a bloody battle , and smashed the myth that the US army was unconquerable .  
All level of party organizations of the armed forces brought into play their roles as the core of leadership and fighting bastions while the broad masses of communist party members acted as exemplary vanguards .  Through forceful ideological and political work , these party organizations imbued all commanders and fighters with party policy decisions and instructions .  
Reporters learned from relevant departments of the General Staff Headquarterstoday that following the construction and development in the past half a century , our armed forces have bid farewell to the era of spreading antidotes by hand and using antidote carts drawn by horses , and have established over 100 systems of modern anti-chemical warfare equipment under nine major series , including the poison-detecting , anti-toxin , cleaning , smoke-generating , and flame-throwing systems .  
In order to develop the capacity for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , an anti-chemical warfare corps school was set up 50 years ago to train anti-chemical warfare cadres for the armed forces .  This raised the curtain of the building of the anti-chemical warfare corps in New China . In the past 50 years , our armed forces have organized troops with a relatively high quality to deal with nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
At present , the equipment of our armed forces for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons has the technical means to reconnoiter and monitor attacks by all kinds of nuclear and chemical weapons and to give alarm .  Such equipment also includes advanced equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons , which is based on modern analysis and testing technology , detecting and alarming technology , and digital telecommunications technology , and is represented by armored anti-chemical reconnaissance vehicles .  
Serial equipment and complete sets of equipment for reconnoitering nuclear and chemical weapons in field operation can dash about in toxic and contaminated areas under all circumstances .  This has provided a firm material basis for increasing the capacity of our armed forces for protection against nuclear , chemical and biological weapons .  
The promulgation of the " Regulations on the Operation of the Anti-chemical Warfare Corps " of the new generation marked an important breakthrough made by our armed forces in their research on the characteristics and objective laws of operation under the threats of nuclear and chemical weapons , and marked a change from emphasizing protection on the same plane in the combined operation of the ground force to three-dimension protection in the joint operation of different armed services .  
With the efforts made in the past years , a system for training a new type of anti-chemical-warfare capable personnel has been formed in our armed forces .  At present , major combat equipment , including tanks , airplanes and vessels can better resist nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , and both the armed forces and the civilian basically have complete sets of equipment for protection against such weapons .  
During the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea in the early 1950s , Chinese military personnel had to fight against poison gas .  To meet the need of such an extremely severe situation , China 's anti-chemical scientific research institute , which was still being organized and established then , urgently began to develop the most needed poison-detecting equipment .  The curtain was then raised on the development of anti-chemical equipment for our armed forces .  
Our military personnel also had to rely on domestically made gas masks .  As far as this aspect is concerned , our armed forces now have a series of advanced protective equipment , which is suitable to the physiological feature of all ethnic groups in China and which meets various operational needs .  In addition , China also has a group of world-renowned experts on poison protection .  
The whole military and armed police forces have meticulously been carrying out and implementing Chairman Jiang 's " five-sentence " general requirement , and grassroots construction has been consistently strengthened and developed in a healthy manner of comprehensive progress and overall improvement .  From this implementation and construction have emerged a large number of advanced examples with outstanding achievements and moving deeds .  
In the 1990 ' s , after the end of the cold war , under international disarmament pressure and opposition from peace forces in Japan , Japan instituted the guideline of " reducing armaments on the one hand while improving the quality on the other " in its military building , and worked to build modern armed forces of " the right scale and ample quality . "  
At all times and in all situations , the banner of the Party should treated as the one banner , initiative must be taken in assuming the task of carrying out the Party 's Central Committee 's and Military Commission 's instructions and directives , a perfect mastery of the political issues in the General Political Department and units directly under its supervision is ensured , and a correct line of guidance for political work of the armed forces is ensured .  
It has also listed " enlisting graduates from an ordinary higher learning institution for military service " as a principal channel for recruiting officers and has further clarified or standardized the two other channels for recruiting officers , namely , " appointing office cadres as officers " and " recruiting professional , technological , or other types of personnel from outside the armed forces as officers . "  
At the same time , however , Russia emphasizes that it attaches greater importance to the development of conventional forces , and makes efforts to enhance its conventional combat capability in dealing with regional armed conflicts and partial wars , so as to be able to more effectively counter real threats of various kinds , especially ethnic splittist forces and separatist activities .  
absorbed experiences of success in the reform of the state personnel system and Army cadre system in recent years ; drew on the beneficial practices of foreign armed forces ; and adjusted and reformed the existing system of officers ' service , in a bid to make all the relevant systems better suited to the development of the situation and the times .  
The US military 's joint training is guided by national security strategy and military strategy and based on joint operations theory ; it strives to gradually make the armed forces into a flexible integrated joint force through carrying out joint training based on requirements , to facilitate the completion of multinational , joint , and multi-institutional missions in wartime or non-wartime military actions , and first of all to be prepared to deal with a large-scale and preemptive regional conflict .  
It has also been laid down that the joint combat center is to provide theoretical , exercise , and technical guidance for combined operations training undertaken by the entire armed forces .  
The military , as an armed group responsible for carrying out special political tasks , should not only be ready to physically fight in battlefields to complete urgent , difficult , dangerous and heavy tasks given by the Party and the people , but also live through various tests and make mental and physical contributions to the reform and construction .  
In short , every division of the armed forces should like the Party Committee of the Air Force emancipate their thinking , update their conceptions and promote a reformative and innovative spirit by launching as many competitive policies and measures as possible so that the military will really become a " warm land " attracting the majority of China 's excellent scientific and technological specialists .

During the Clinton years , as the US economy was steadily strong , and salary increases for the non-military sector rose faster than did the military 's , making the military less attractive .  This made many talented people reluctant to serve in the armed forces , and various armed forces personnel in key positions to decide against making it a career .  This affected the overall quality of the US armed forces .  
Our military is an armed group for carrying out revolutionary political tasks .  This group should consistently uphold and support the reform , align its interests to the overall interests of national economic construction and serve this construction .  This group should also satisfactorily fulfill its sacred duty of protecting national security and maintaining social stability .  
In the past five years our army has completely fulfilled the strategic task of reducing its personnel by 500,000 , totally ceased all commercial activities of the armed forces and armed police , won great victory in the fight against floods in 1998 , organized with high standards the parade for the 50th anniversary of the PRC , defended national sovereignty , security , and the unity of the motherland , and preserved social stability , and thus provided a reliable guarantee for China 's reforms , opening up , and modernization .  
Deputy Chi Haotian pointed out that great achievements were recorded in modernizing national defense and the armed forces during the Ninth FYP .  In the face of the complex situation at home and abroad , our army held aloft the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , and resolutely obeyed the commands of the CPC Central Committee and CMC with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core ; ideological and political building was further stepped up ;  
We should profoundly understand the great significance of studying , and practicing the important thinking on " three represents " from the level of " the foundation of building the party , the basis of ruling the country , and the source of strength , " vigorously step up ideological and political building , and ensure that the important thinking on " three represents " is truly implemented in building national defense and the armed forces .

In his speech , Yu Yongbo pointed out : The current education drive is an important move and practical step taken on the basis of positive education in " three stresses " carried out in party committees at the regimental level and grassroots units of the armed forces to further study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " , improve the quality of the ranks of party members , and strengthen party building in the armed forces .

He emphasized the necessity of gaining a thorough understanding of the strategic policy-decision made by the party Central Committee and CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin and of earnestly strengthening the sense of mission in participating in and supporting the development of the west .  
Our armed forces are a great wall of steel that defends the motherland and are also an important force for socialist modernization .  Participation in and support for the development of the west is the inevitable demand on the armed forces in their process of putting the " three represents [ representing the demands for the development of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture in China , and the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the people ] " thinking into practice .  
They must pay special attention to giving play to the political advantage of the armed forces and actively guide and help , in various ways , the people of various ethnic groups to be of one heart and one mind with the party , actively take part in the development of the western region , and promote simultaneous progress in building the material and spiritual civilizations .

In recent years , with the gradual establishment of the socialist market economic system , the party central leadership and the State Council adopted more concrete measures for dealing with the prominent problems that were affecting the order of the market economy and for effecting a fundamental turn for the better in this regard .

The true essence and vital point of western hostile forces in distorting the objective relationship between the armed forces on the one hand and the party , politics , and the state on the other and vigorously peddling these reactionary viewpoints is to attempt in vain to remove our armed forces from party leadership and thus finish off our party , state , and armed forces .

Since ours are modernized compound armed forces formed by various services and arms and supported by some space technology , if the commanders of our ground divisions have never seen a warship , a fighter plane , a campaign missile , or a tactical missile , and if the commanders of our naval and air units have never learned about the characteristics of a modern ground campaign , we will definitely lose the most basic knowledge support in cultivating such a concept as joint operations .

The appointment of certain a retired lieutenant colonel of the national armed forces by the name of Liu to be a regimental commander with the rank of colonel in the Nanjing Military Region is the first case in which the Chinese communists have appointed a turncoat of Taiwan 's national armed forces as field commanding officer with real power .  
Through extensive investigation , the unit concerned discovered from information obtained that the Chinese communists are in the process of drawing up a complicated plan for conducting united front work among Taiwan troops , and the case is an experiment to test how well Officer Liu can assimilate into the PLA and whether their plan to form a united front with our national armed forces is feasible .  
According to our intelligence , the Chinese communists have not yet completed the plan for " the encouragement of retired officers and men of national armed forces to cross over to serve the PLA . " The Chinese communists are expected to announce and publicize the completed plan in six months at the earliest or before the presidential elections in 2004 at the latest to break down the morale of our troops .  
These people naturally bear a grudge against the armed forces or the government .  Since military personnel have their deep-rooted political belief and ideology , the top military and intelligence leaders are taking communist China 's military united front work plan for the recruitment of our retired servicemen very seriously .  The unit concerned has in fact identified a certain retired army lieutenant general as a possible hidden target of military united front work by the Chinese communists , as he has been seeking advantage for himself by all means on the mainland .  
To cope with the situation as quickly as possible , the government should increase high-technology weapons , get rid of the thinking of symmetrical operations , change the current situation in which the army amounts to a higher proportion in the three armed forces , and implement as quickly as possible the tactic of downsized troops .  In this way , the situation in which outlays for personnel maintenance accounts for half the annual defense budget and eats up the military investment budget can be avoided and fighting capability will be intensified .  
The US military has to spend a huge amount of fund to sustain the armed forces capable of fighting " two wars . "  This strategy requires that the United States maintain at least 1.4-million troops on active service .  Even with such a massive army , the Pentagon has to admit , the United States can only undertake less than a half of the war tasks .  
To prove that all this is not non-existent , the US Department of Defense recently also announced that it would provide Taiwan a " joint tactical information transmission system " worth $ 725-million and transform Taiwan 's " joint operation command center of the three armed services " and the operation command centers of various types of units , so that the United States and Taiwan could be linked through identical operation command systems .  
Besides , speaking of the US Defense Department 's decision on selling 50 sets of advanced " joint tactical information distribution systems " to Taiwan , Fu Wei-ku stated : The advanced tactical information distribution system will help Taiwan 's three services reorganize and integrate their telecommunication systems , and to share telecommunication equipment and language with " fraternal forces " as well , and this will in turn benefit Taiwan 's armed forces in " joint operations , " and even in " allied operations . "  
It was a mid-summer day .  A certain corvette unit of the navy received the order and rapidly set numerous corvettes and armed fishing vessels at sea in a mixed formation .  After passing through an area covered with islands and reefs , the formation launched a surprise attack and staged a terrific " annihilation battle " in the area where the enemy was operating .  
In order to ensure harbor safety and a smooth navigation channel during wartime , the unit made full use of local fishing vessels in their preparations for military struggles and regarded conducting joint military-civilian sea drills to " launch counterattacks on small-scale enemies " an important study subject .  After repeated deliberations and verifications , the unit drew up a plan to build a combined formation of corvettes and armed fishing vessels and lay down the principle for allocating men and equipment .  
At this jubilant moment , we would like to extend festival congratulations to all officers and soldiers of the army and the armed police force , the militiamen and the reserves , cordial regards to retired old cadres , demobilized servicemen , disabled soldiers and family members of martyrs , who have made outstanding contribution to the building of the people 's army , and high respect to people of all ethnic groups across the country who are concerned about and support national defense and army building ! 
Su Zhirong : In the new era , the PLA has set implementation of military combat preparedness as the primary objective of modernization , with the armed forces building the " two fundamental transitions , " that is : in military combat preparedness , making the transition from dealing with combat situations under normal conditions to achieving victory in combat under conditions of modern technology , especially high technology ;  
Forecasts are that in the not-too-distant future , there will be a major improvement in the academic credentials of the entire armed forces , officers and men at every level , with the tentative plan being that the doctoral degree will be a priority for officers at and above the army commander level , the master 's degree for division and brigade commanders , and a college education for officers at the regimental level and below , and this will become a reality .  
Jiang Zemin emphasized that the general task of the whole party and the whole armed forces is to meet the needs of the new international situation in the new century , gain more relatively peaceful time to develop the economy , science , technology and military to a new level , and increase the comprehensive national strength .  Only in this way will it be possible to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity better and this is the strategic policy .  
After the West 's armed forces led by the United States had sampled the " sweet taste " of victory , they intensified their theoretical research and brought forth new ideas about actual combat : building modernized psychological warfare training centers , and establishing specialized psychological warfare units .  
Afterwards , Su-27 fighters , " Flying Leopard " fighters , and Qiang-5 attack aircraft began their air raids .  Then , special armed units parachuted in for sudden attacks .  Shielded by destroyers , landing-craft vessels , submarines , and armored helicopters , tens of thousands of field army troops , the naval marine brigade , called as the world army No . 1 , and amphibious tanks fiercely attacked the offshore islands off Dongshan Island and Zhaoan Bays and attacked Penghu Island and Taiwan Island in a simulated manner .  
It is precisely these two " leaps " that have provided vast room for the development of the Japanese armed forces .  Thus , the self-defense forces are developing in the direction of long-range and massive weapons .  Moreover , Japan has joined hands with the United States to push ahead with the development of the Theater Missile Defense system in a bid to achieve absolute military superiority with which it " can both attack other countries and avoid attacks from them . "  
A certain brigade 's tactic of shooting aerial targets with light weapons achieved a combat record to be proud of on the battlefields of the War to Resist America and Aid Korea , and it was now to be put to use in attacking armed helicopters .  It had been successful in tests in attacking substitute aerial targets .  Units had demonstrated several times that this achievement uses the inferior to defeat the superior .  
Cadres and soldiers did penetrating research on foreign military equipment and discovered that , considering the defensive and maneuvering capabilities of modern armed helicopters , ordinary light weapons definitely can not shoot them down easily .  
For the sake of ensuring the unity of our motherland , the Chinese armed forces are perfectly capable of monitoring fixed and moving targets along the southeastern coast and nearby waters , to spot , track , and identify medium-sized and larger military vessels .  They are capable of anytime , all-weather monitoring of large warships ( mainly aircraft carriers ) .  
The key to building a system of logistics support that is adaptable to joint operations and to fundamentally eliminating such deficiencies as multiple channeling , separation of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , and operation via separate bodies is to take the road of integration .  This will bring about a new setup of logistics support where support for the three armed services are integrated as one , the system is compatible to both the military and the civilian , and the general-purpose logistics supplies and services are all supported in a unified way .  
However , as far as its essence is concerned , only the pattern of integration of the general-purpose support and the special-purpose support , which gives expression to the basic connotation of the integration pattern , can in a fundamental way do away with the restrictions imposed by " departments and regions , " thoroughly break down the pattern in which logistics support to the three armed forces is provided separately , and really effect a leap from the joint rear service support to integrated logistics support for the three armed forces .  
The policy of treating a disease by looking into both its root cause and symptoms and tackling a problem in a comprehensive way was further implemented .  Army , armed police , procuratorial , judicial and public security organizations thoroughly broke off relations with their subsidiary enterprises while the work of breaking off relations between the central state organs and their subsidiary enterprises was basically implemented and progress was also made in the work of breaking off relations between the local Party and administrative organs and their subsidiary enterprises .  
It shows the wonderful , exciting , and highly appealing shots depicting the ocean-crossing long voyage of the Navy 's destroyers , the go-beyond-the-limit flights of helicopters , the life of marines in isolated islands , the long-range raid and missile-firing exercises of an airborne unit , and it also shows the good image of the Chinese armed forces being mighty and civilized and their high morale .  The documentary is an authoritative work with which to understand the Chinese armed forces .  
He emphasized the necessity of giving prominence to key points , linking with the reality of the armed forces , closely centering around the two historical themes of " being able to win " and " not changing color " facing the PLA , thinking deeply about how to keep abreast of the new trends in the world 's military development and how to bring about development in big strides in the modernization of the armed forces , and putting forward suggestions and proposals that show real knowledge and deep insight .  
Now , it is basically provided with the capacities of conducting sea-air maneuver and conducting operations in coordination with all other armed forces .  It has played a positive role in resisting the invasion of foreign enemies , defending the security of the sea and the air , safeguarding China 's marine rights and interests , and supporting the economic construction of the state .  
Meanwhile , last year the Central Military Commission strictly prohibited the army and armed police forces from engaging in business or running enterprises and the income from their business operations which was used as welfare subsidies was thus cut .  Therefore , it was necessary for central financial authorities to compensate this lost portion of financial resources for them .  
These non-traditional acts of violence are not accepted as legal national means of war by today 's international military systems and by modern international laws on armed confrontation , because by most countries ' existing laws and moral order , most of those acts are clearly and unmistakably illegal acts of violence .  A country founded on laws and democratic traditions can not regard an illegal act as a legal means .  
The military pointed out that the result of the presidential poll , which led to a change of the ruling party , aroused discontent from military cadres , most of whom are Kuomintang members .  For this reason , Defense Minister Tang Fei and Chief of General Staff Tang Yao-ming both made speeches at the meeting , hoping that the three armed services will submit to the election outcome and focus on stabilizing the situation and reassuring the public .  
The joint statement issued by the leaders of China and Russia in 1997 indicated that " both sides advocate a new concept of security that is universal in meaning , believing that we must abandon the ' Cold War mentality ' and oppose bloc politics , and that we must resolve the differences and disputes between nations peacefully , not resorting to armed force or mutual threats of armed force , promoting the establishment of mutual understanding and trust through dialogues and discussions and seeking peace and security through bilateral and multilateral coordination and cooperation . "  
Last year when Putin acted as prime minister , he took resolute action and ordered that the Russian army recover Chechnya occupied by illegal armed forces .  Although the Russian army suffered heavy casualties , this move received the support of the people and the military .  
Luo Gan , secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission , who is in personal charge of this , has called on the state security departments , as well as the public security and armed police officers , in all localities to draw up meticulous plans and strike hard at the key Falungong elements who stir up trouble , in order to maintain political and social stability .

US Army General ( Greg Hackett ) announced on 4 April that in the next 20 years the US Army will spend $ 38 billion on procuring 1,213 RAH-66 Comanche armed helicopters ; this is the world 's first helicopter of high intelligence capacity , fully digitized and electronic ; it has good stealth capability , advanced electronic equipment , and a high degree of automation , with strong ground attack capability and relatively strong aerial fighting capability ;  
He pointed out that under the unified leadership of the central authorities , the military and armed police , the party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs regarded implementing the central policy decision as a serious political task and assigned it an important position ; they swept into action with a high sense of political responsibility and sense of work urgency , and got a really good grasp of implementation , with the result that this work has continually proceeded in a healthy and orderly way .  
Hu Jintao said that in the past two years the leadership group offices , handover work offices , and military and armed police leadership group offices and their staff at all levels have displayed the spirit of selfless devotion and the style of fighting continuous combat , scrupulously carried out their duties , worked hard , swept into action , done their work in a precise and meticulous way , carried out a great deal of arduous and detailed and highly effective work , and completely fulfilled this political task assigned by the central authorities .  
Hu Jintao pointed out that the key to why the work of withdrawing the military , armed police , and political and legal organs from business activities has been able to fulfill the predicted target in a relatively short time and has consistently maintained stability in the overall situation lies in the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee , State Council , and CMC , in the positive efforts of the large military units , armed police , and regions and departments , and in the effective support of all sectors of society .  
Through carrying out this work , not only have the military , armed police , the party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs undergone testing in stressing politics , taking account of the overall situation , and observing discipline ; we have also found a number of effective measures and summed up a number of successful experiences , which provide a useful reference for unfolding specific items of tidying things up in the future .  
If in the future a problem again arises of some unit of the military , the armed police , or the political and legal organs engaging in business activities , we will hold accountable not only those directly responsible but also the leaders of that unit in accordance with the regulations on building good party style and clean government , and will strictly discipline them .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized at the conclusion of the meeting that the military , armed police , party committees and government at all levels , and the political and legal organs must seriously implement the spirit of Comrade Hu Jintao 's speech , further enhance understanding of the great strategic significance of the central policy decision , and enhance awareness of upholding the decision .  
Chi Haotian said : Since China and Azerbaijan established diplomatic ties , bilateral ties have developed smoothly .  The Chinese armed forces have paid attention to developing friendly ties with the Azerbaijani armed forces .  China would also like to develop multilevel exchanges between the two armies in various fields on the basis of mutual respect , equality , and mutual benefit .  
Chi Haotian pointed out that strengthening preparation for war [ zhan bei gong zuo ] , upgrading the high-tech and high-quality equipment of the armed forces , and making good preparation for properly fighting an " anti-Taiwan-independence " war and opposing hegemonic military intervention at any time are the principle for war preparation formulated by the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission in accordance with the reality that the two sides of the strait are still in a state of war and hegemony has not stopped interfering in China 's internal affairs .  
In fact , the Taiwan authorities have never relaxed military preparations for " armed resistance to reunification . "  They have purchased a massive amount of advanced weaponry from foreign countries and sought to join the theater missile defense system in a bid to establish a certain disguised form of military alliance with the United States and Japan .  
The forthcoming issue of the " Zhongguo Pinglun " monthly , which will soon be published here , has disclosed : Once a situation involving " Three Ifs " as laid down in the " White Paper " emerges , the mainland will adopt in light of its seriousness tactics like armed deterrent , " strike " ( a missile strike at specified points ) , " blockade " ( a sea or air blockade ) , and " landing " ( a joint amphibious landing operation ) respectively . 
As reported , the establishment of military lawyers in the armed forces ' political institutions will be put under the leadership of the chiefs of the relevant units , and political institutions will perform their duties under the leadership of the legal advisory offices of the relevant units and receive guidance from the higher level of responsible judicial departments in professional work .  
Chi Haotian said that since establishing diplomatic relations in 1985 China and Bolivia have enjoyed smooth development of friendly cooperative relations , both sides have expanded exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , military and cultural fields , to which China is satisfied , and is willing to make continuous efforts to further relations between the two states and armed forces in a healthy and stable way .  
After Chen Shui-bian , who had been a member of the opposition party , was elected as Taiwan 's new leader , the outside generally doubted whether or not the armed forces , which had been controlled by the Kuomintang over a long time , would take orders from Chen Shui-bian , who previously was strongly opposed to interference in government work by the military , called for cutting military spending , and exposed the dark side of the military , and doubted whether or not the military would stage a coup d'tat .  
He said that to promote national defense in future , we must " carry out nationalization of the armed forces , establish modern and highly-efficient military strength for national defense , conduct streamlined training for war , increase the combined combat-effectiveness of the three armed services , improve quality , improve welfare , and establish the dignity of the national troops . "  
Only when the masses of the people are educated and armed with these two aspects of advanced culture can the Chinese nation 's ideological , ethical , scientific , and cultural qualities be improved unceasingly .  
The party committees and political organs at all levels of the army and armed police held during their study that , guided by Deng Xiaoping Theory , Chairman Jiang 's important speech has comprehensively analyzed the international and domestic situation and the tasks facing ideological and political work , profoundly explained the important role of ideological and political work in the overall situation of reform , development , and stability , and specifically proposed the guidelines and principles for further strengthening and improving ideological and political work .  
During their studies the officers and men of the army and the armed police pointed out that ours is a people 's army under the party 's absolute leadership , and strong and effective ideological and political work is the political strong point in our development and growth and our cherished magic weapon for defeating the enemy .  We must unswervingly assign ideological and political work the primary position in all work .  
Second , the US military has a large number of complex and high-tech weapons .  Therefore , there is a large consumption and costly price for logistical and technical support .  In addition , because of independent purchases systems for various weapons of armed services , the maintenance and upkeep is extremely difficult .  
have intensified our financial support for social security system building ; have continually increased our input in agricultural , forestry , water conservancy , as well as ecological or environmental protection projects ; have comprehensively implemented the CPC Central Committee 's decision on banning the army , the armed police , or the political and legal affairs organs from engaging in commercial activities ;  
intensified the support of the treasury for the development of the social security system ; continued to increase the input into agriculture , forestry , and water resources management , as well as the protection of the ecological environment ; comprehensively implemented the decision taken by the CPC Central Committee to stop armed forces , the armed police force , and political and judicial organs from engaging in business activities ;  
It is necessary to thoroughly understand the new and higher demands set by the " three represents " on the building the armed forces ideologically and politically .  It is necessary to further emancipate the mind , update concepts , courageously blaze new trails , and strive to make ideological and political work more lively , solid and effective in light of the new situation and tasks in order to provide a powerful spiritual motive force and a reliable political guarantee for " winning victories " and " preventing degeneration . "  
In recent years , the Taiwan authorities led by Lee Teng-hui carried out armaments expansions without restraint , stressing augmenting the Taiwan armed forces ' control of the air and command of the sea by relying on the geographical position of an isolated island and under the guidance of the military thinking of " active defensive and effective deterrence . "  The Air Force 's special budget for the purchase of F-16 and " Mirage-2000 " fighters alone was as high as $ 12 billion .  
During the visit , Jiang Zemin urged all departments participating in the cooperation of war industries to implement the principle of " the integration of military and civilian use , and the integration of wartime and peacetime needs , " meet the needs of the new situation of the development of the socialist market economy , adhere to the principle of turning civilians into a part of the armed forces , and establish a vigorous structure for the development science and technology for national defense ;  
Under the complicated struggles , officers and men of the judicial organs and armed police have taken a firm and clear-cut stand , forcefully attacked the national splittist forces and terrorist and violent criminal activities , and maintained stability of the overall social and political situation .  
In fact , since taking office Chen Shuibian has never acknowledged the " one China " principle ; he has repeatedly said that " Taiwan is a sovereign independent state , " blocked cross-strait political contacts and negotiations , and glibly talked about a " decisive battle offshore , " in a bid to reject reunification by using armed force ; and all this is related to the continual wrong signals being given by the United States .  
Seventy years ago , facing the white terror of the Kuomintang reactionaries , Mr . Deng Yanda established the Interim Action Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang , the predecessor of the Peasants ' and Workers ' Democratic Party , and explicitly set forth the political program of overthrowing the Chiang Kai-shek regime by means of armed force and establishing a political power of common people with peasants and workers as the main body .  After Mr .  
The General Armament Department of the People 's Liberation Army recently held a forum of military representative bureau heads of the armed forces , which stressed that the building of the army 's weapons and equipment must match the overall situation of economic construction and national defense construction ; it is necessary to seriously study the new situation and characteristics of the work of military representatives under socialist market economy conditions , and further speed up the reforms in the building of the army 's weapons and equipment .  
The meeting maintained : During the Ninth Five-Year period , our army 's logistics construction and reform progressed in a comprehensive way , with key areas highlighted , and developed in a coordinated way ; while living an austere life , logistics officers and soldiers throughout the armed forces worked hard , made innovations while opening up new ground in work constantly , and accomplished something significant .  Hence , considerable progress was made in logistics construction .  
more than 10,000 officers and men of a certain infantry division swam across the choppy sea fully armed and rapidly landed on shore ; amphibious armored combat vehicles struck ferociously at targets on the opposite shore , made a forced beach landing , and crushed all resistance .  
In addition to striving to stabilize the political situation , plan economic reform , pacify Chechnya , reorganize the armed forces , and declare war on the increasingly influential financial oligarchs and local warlords , he has also been actively and steadily readjusting Russia 's foreign policy and intensely pursuing a pragmatic diplomacy .  
To cut off Chechnyan rebellious armed forces ' foreign aid and route of retreat and to create conditions for a comprehensive and complete settlement of the Chechen issue , Putin has been working actively to obtain the understanding and support of the international community .  
The CMC stressed the need to finish all the tasks of reducing the size of the armed forces by half a million in the last year of the three-year deadline .  Moreover , the armed forces should concentrate their limited financial resources on striving to effect , in the shortest possible time , a complete change from a manpower-intensive and numerically large type to a technology-intensive and quality-based efficient one to ensure that they can cope with a hi-tech local war that may break out at any time .  
Practice has proved that the success or failure of UN peacekeeping operations depends on whether they are carried out in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter , and in particular , whether they follow the principles of respecting national sovereignty , refraining from interfering in other countries ' internal affairs , gaining the consent of the parties involved , maintaining a neutral stand , and refraining from using armed force except in self-defense .  
The secret national defense budget for next fiscal year will total more than 58 billion yuan .  To strengthen their combat readiness in the electronic and communications arenas , the plans proposed by the armed forces include completion of an electronic counterattack shelter network and an online defense system .  Geared against Chicom 's active efforts to develop electromagnetic impulse attack , there will also be a " project to protect against electromagnetic impulse . "  
With regard to measures against missiles , although the TMD system being developed is a thing in the far distant future , in the next fiscal year the national armed forces will still invest more than 6 billion yuan to build up joint air defense and counterattack capabilities .  
After the explosion occurred , relevant leaders of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region and Urumqi City promptly went to the scene of the explosion to direct rescue operations .  Several hundred public security personnel , armed police , and military personnel stationed in the area as well as more than 100 medical personnel swiftly plunged into fire fighting and rescue work .  The injured people were sent to nearby hospitals for emergency treatment .  
According to reports , along the journey of advancing into the new century , all units of the military have rode on the strong east wind of the central ideological and political work meeting , earnestly acted in the spirit of Chairman Jiang 's important speech , and with higher standard and full of enthusiasm , striven to produce new results in strengthening and improving ideological and political education in the armed forces and to create a new situation .  
He has demanded that the Taiwan armed forces establish the strategic idea of " fighting a decisive battle offshore " and develop offensive weapons such as air-to-ground missiles , based on the notion of " repelling the enemy on the opposite shore " ; and for the first time Jinmen was included in the " Wan An exercise " on 16 August .

Chi Haotian said : Sino-Colombian relations have enjoyed a smooth development since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1980 , and the two sides have increased exchanges and cooperation in political , economic , and cultural fields .  The two armed forces have also further developed their relations on the basis of bilateral ties .  
Modern war is a huge war of attrition , and Taiwan 's limited arms will be used up very rapidly , whereas the mainland has tremendous potential for fighting a war of attrition , and this determines that Taiwan will be unable to wage protracted war with the mainland ; and given the consumption of large numbers of arms and men , Taiwan will not be able to sustain the fight for long and its armed forces will collapse .  
In the separation of government functions from enterprise management , for example , problems arising from the running of commercial enterprises by special interest entities were solved when the military , armed police and political and legal organs were ordered in 1998 to disengage themselves from commercial operations .  
The army , the armed police , the CPC committees and governments at all levels , and procuratorial , judicial and public security organs , treated the implementation of the policy decision as a serious political task .  They took vigorous and resolute action and worked in a down-to-earth and meticulous manner .  
A group of military commanding talents is in the making , who have had a modern scientific and cultural knowledge and a modern management knowledge and who are capable of using modern weapons and are capable of organizing and commanding combined operations among different arms and services .  A new enhancement has been noticed in both the military and political qualities of the officers and men of the three armed services .  
It has focussed on the major theories and practical issues related to the preparations for military struggle , thus further defining the orientation and thinking of deepening the training of troops through science and technology .  The training of troops through science and technology represents a profound revolution in the military affairs of China 's armed forces at the end of the 20th century .  
The whole army should use as its guidance Chairman Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " as well as on strengthening the armed forces and improving their training through science and technology .  In light of the military strategic principle in the new period as well as the goal of realizing the preparations for military struggle , the whole army should continuously deepen its ideological understanding .  In addition , the whole army should ensure that it follows correct orientation during the whole process of training of troops through science and technology .  
We must unswervingly focus on economic development by grasping opportunities and accelerating development .  This is a scientific decision made by the CPC Central Committee after making a correct judgment of international and domestic situation .  Facts related to China 's social development and national defense construction have proved that only when we have developed our economy , can we enhance our overall national strength and can the modernization of our armed forces have solid material foundation and strong personnel support .  
Only by so doing , can they better implement their sacred mission entrusted by the party and the people .  They said : In accordance with the guiding spirit of the " proposal , " we will focus on the overall construction of the armed forces , strive to push forward socialist spiritual civilization construction as well as democratic and legal construction .  
Recently , to allow " information to be commonly shared " and enhance our three-dimensional penetrating ability in gathering information from across the strait , the Ministry of National Defense even merged the three services ' intelligence collection systems and streamlined the information transmission methods to enliven the armed forces ' coast-based systems of early warning , wartime command , observation , communication , search for carrier terminals , and reconnaissance , thus establishing a very careful entity as well as a mobile and flexible reconnaissance and communication system .  
The most important point is whether the entire people possess a strong combat will .  This is also the core of the policy of " national defense by the whole people . "  As long as the people throughout the country strengthen their mental defense , reinforce the all-people 's defense mechanism , do not fear communist China 's propaganda offensive and military threat , and remain a backing for the government and armed forces , the armed forces will certainly have confidence and ability to ensure the country 's security .  
2 .  The two sides agree to maintain frequent exchange of visits and contacts between top leaders of the two countries .  The two sides also agree to further strengthen the friendly exchanges and cooperation between their governmental institutions , parliaments , political parties , armed forces and non-governmental organizations with a view to enhancing mutual trust and friendship and promoting an all-round , steady , and in-depth development of the bilateral relations .  
The regular meeting of the general staff departments of the Chinese and Russian armed forces to discuss international and regional situations and issues of common interest is an important component of the Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership and a specific embodiment of the further development of relations between the two armed forces , and it will help both sides not only strengthen mutual understanding and trust but also coordinate their stand and strengthen their cooperation in international affairs .  
At the end of the visit , Chi Haotian said he was accorded a warm reception by the Algerian Government and armed forces during the visit .

Revolving around the political steadfastness and ideological and moral purity of troops , the entire military and armed police force regard resisting " red lanterns and green wine " [ feasting and revelry ] and preventing the erosion of decadent ideology and culture as a breakthrough point to vigorously grasp the education and consolidation of ideologies , styles , and disciplines as well as the internal and external relations .  
The fruitful achievements of the " four educations " in the People 's Liberation Army and the armed police force have provided beneficial inspiration for strengthening and improving the ideological and political work in our Party and our military during the new historical period .  
Over the educational practice of the last six years , the party committees and political organs at all levels of the entire military and the armed police force have justifiably and loudly upheld high quality and style , explained well large principles , propagated advanced things and developed healthy tendencies in a large way , and refuted erroneous ways and rectified unhealthy tendencies in a clear-cut manner , thus creating a strong public opinion and excellent ideological atmosphere about taking the overall situation into consideration , emphasizing the dedication , and observing disciplines .

Now the established size of the entire military is kept under the level of 2.5 million personnel , and consequently the Chinese military has embarked on the road toward streamlined armed forces with Chinese characteristics .  
Because of the increasing tighter budgets for national defense and because the navy hoped to include the budget for purchasing Kidd-class warships into the investment budget checked and verified by the Headquarters of the General Staff to avoid increasing government spending or squeezing out investment budgets of friendly armed services , the naval personnel told the US side at the very beginning of the talks that they could only buy three warships instead of four if the prices could not be reduced .  
The " Yining incident " occurred on 5 February 1997 , when nearly 1,000 young Uygurs held a march in Yining demanding that the government authorities release a number of young Uygurs arrested for writing an antigovernment article ; the march turned into a riot , with the young Uygurs shouting Xinjiang independence slogans and attacking Chinese and setting fire to the bodies of Chinese they had beaten to death ; large numbers of public security personnel and armed police came out to suppress them , and calm was eventually restored next day .

First , give priority to preventing , cracking down hard , and punishing corruption in the antigraft , discipline inspection , procuratorate , supervisory , court , auditing , judicial , customs , public security , armed police , and army systems ; since these are state dictatorship organs , on the one hand the state has to ensure that they " eat imperial grain , " and on the other hand the state demands that they must fairly enforce the law and ensure honest government .  This is the precondition for opposing corruption in China .  
Le Kha Phieu spoke highly of the fruitful cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and military fields between Vietnam and China and appreciated China 's great achievements in reform and opening up .

As Chinese know from their own books , " The Chinese armed forces held Shanghai amidst bitter fighting from August to November , and even then the Japanese were unable to completely rout the Chinese . " But in the relevant Japanese film , the viewer only gets two images - - " Fighting has spread to Shanghai , where our forces are heavily engaged , " and " Valiant naval airmen who gave their lives " - - that gloss right over actual events .  
It is no accident that jeeps traversing the mountain forests today are able to climb steep slopes and ford streams . The fact is that overcoming dangerous obstacles is part and parcel of their basic nature . During World War II the American armed forces produced a powerful " general purpose " vehicle which could be driven across sand , mud and gravel , which could cross shallow rivers and climb steep slopes .  
The Investigation Bureau has received a tip that organized crime might be involved in the development of a radio communications system and related equipment , a project being carried out by the Chungshan Institute of Science and Technology on contract to the armed forces .

The same holds true regarding the level of technical expertise required to carry out its operations . "  
Hau Pei-tsun , a former premier as well as chief of the General Staff , was a member of the armed forces for most of his career . Speaking about his experience as chief of the General Staff , Hau has stated that the military already has a perfectly sound procurement system , and that the important thing is the ethical standards of the officers in charge . If top generals get involved in politics and start engaging in tricky power plays , the military will naturally fall into disarray .  
In military affairs , after the PRC unilaterally broke off negotiations in 1995 , they initiated a series of missile tests in the Taiwan Strait . According to the ROC Ministry of Defense , in recent years the PRC has continually seen Taiwan 's new generation of military capabilities as its primary hypothetical enemy and undertaken numerous military exercises based on this premise . In addition , the national defense report just issued by the PRC emphasized repeatedly that the possibility of using armed force against Taiwan could not be excluded .  
According to the PRC 's national defense white paper for this year , mainland China has realized that there is a global trend toward domination of the battlefield through high-technology weapons . Therefore , the PLA is aggressively " moving along the path of a streamlined , high-quality military with Chinese characteristics .

Before the war , he only hunted animals , or perhaps would take part in an occasional " headhunting ceremony . " In either case , he acted on his own behalf , or at most on behalf of his tribe in times of armed conflict with neighboring tribes .

The sacrifices he made were for a society that extended far beyond the confines of his tribe , and his actions took on a totally different significance .  
As for gangs and secret societies , these are organizations which have existed among the common people in China since ancient times . They began to grow more widespread in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties , and particularly after the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns [ 1723-1795 ] , they spread all over China like a cancer . I call them " local armed fighting groups , " and in fact what they did was to fight and grab territory .

This is why we hope that the United Nations , through the recently established United Nations Mission in Guatemala ( MINUGUA ) , will continue to contribute , directly or indirectly , to securing a prompt conclusion to negotiations aimed at bringing a speedy and definitive end to the domestic armed conflict that has plagued Guatemala during more than 30 years of struggle which is as tragic as it is pointless .  
As the international community is aware , the Agreement signed at Chapultepec , Mexico , in January 1992 put an end to the armed conflict in El Salvador , marking the conclusion of the first phase of the peace process but the beginning of a complex and difficult period of transition during which the commitments made served as the framework for a developing political , economic and social process , which we are convinced will culminate in the consolidation of democracy . 
The Executive Committee expressed its deep concern and preoccupation with the immense human suffering and loss of life in recent crises and the scale and complexity of current refugee problems , and deplored the incidence of armed attack and of murder , rape and other violations of fundamental rights , as well as refoulement and denial of access to safety .  
The Committee regrets that the headquarters of the General Intelligence Department has been recognized as an official prison , that the armed forces officers are granted the capacity of public prosecutors , that they have the capacity of detaining suspects incommunicado , whether military persons or civilians , until the end of their interrogation for periods of up to six months , and that detainees are deprived of access to judges , lawyers or doctors .  
Morocco , which opted for dialogue as a fundamental principle in its policy vis - - vis its neighbours , propounded that principle in international forums as the best means of avoiding armed conflict and sought to settle all problems by peaceful means , remains convinced that its historical ties with Spain , coupled with the two countries ' common economic interests , will help overcome the difficulties that stand in the way of a solution to this dispute .

While on the subject of youth issues , we should refer to the importance of devoting special attention to the neediest categories of society , especially the handicapped and those who live in rural areas in which only basic services are available to the young , as well as the inhabitants of areas with particular difficulties , such as those under occupation and those afflicted by armed conflicts .  
We share the Secretary-General 's positive outlook , which is based on the prospect of the region 's being free of armed conflicts and effecting institutional changes capable of supporting new programmes of social and economic reforms that will make it possible to consolidate sustainable development .  
All of us here are aware that threats to international peace and security arise from the deterioration of the social , economic and institutional fabric of States , and that their worst effects , such as internal armed conflicts , drug trafficking , corruption and the inevitable sequel of those ills , poverty , are the seed-bed in which international conflicts tend to germinate . 
Indeed , given the presence and the flow of refugees and displaced persons on our territory , and aware of the importance of international solidarity which was manifest during the ecological catastrophe at Lake Nyos in Cameroon in 1986 and of the need to confront unpredictable situations in an uncertain future , my Government decided to establish within Cameroon 's armed forces a specialized unit for peace-keeping and humanitarian assistance operations .  
As I have said on other occasions , this state of affairs is aggravated by armed conflicts , civil wars , the AIDS pandemic added to other devastating or debilitating endemic illnesses , such as malaria and by emergency situations , such as famine , drought , natural disasters , desertification and so on .

All armed action or repressive measures of all kinds directed against dependent peoples shall cease in order to enable them to exercise peacefully and freely their right to complete independence , and the integrity of their national territory shall be respected .  The Declaration , which was adopted without a dissenting vote , was an expression of the world 's desire to speed up the liberation of colonial peoples .  
I fear that there are States in which regular armed forces , insurgent groups or civilians are engaged in mine laying right now , and that , as I speak , arms manufacturers in some States are exporting mines , indifferent to the likelihood that they will be used recklessly and wantonly in breach of fundamental humanitarian principles on the protection of civilians from deliberate or indiscriminate attack .  
By this I mean , for example , earmarking for the armed forces imposts on exports of raw materials such as oil or preferential treatment for businesses controlled or owned by the armed forces , which may also be stockholders in major public and private companies .

" Expressing grave concern that the number of armed conflicts has not decreased since the end of the cold war , and that international and ethnic conflicts are an ongoing reality in nearly every region , resulting in violations of human rights , especially those of women and children , including massive loss of life ,  
Countries should take urgent measures to avert the ongoing rapid environmental and economic degradation in developing countries that generally affects the lives of women and children in rural areas suffering drought , desertification and deforestation , armed hostilities , natural disasters , toxic waste and the aftermath of the use of unsuitable agro-chemical products .  
Among these are chronic hunger , malnutrition , illicit drug problems , organized crime , corruption , foreign occupation , armed conflicts , illicit arms trafficking , terrorism , intolerance and incitement to racial , ethnic , religious and other hatreds , xenophobia , and endemic , communicable and chronic diseases .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger and disability , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
In order to counter the instability posed by the production and proliferation of weapons , women 's non-governmental organizations have called for reductions in military expenditures world wide and for the elimination of the international weapons trade , questioning the morality of a militaristic culture and armed conflict as a means of resolving disagreements .  
These unconstitutional and illegal acts , which in essence , constituted political and legal aggression against a sovereign State , namely the Azerbaijani Republic , have never been repudiated by the Republic of Armenia , thus proving that Armenia should bear sole responsibility as the organizer and principal agent of the aggression against Azerbaijan . During this seven-year war , the armed forces of the Republic of Armenia have committed thousands of crimes in Azerbaijani territory .  
Any armed attack on the civilian population is obviously prohibited , and that prohibition does not end even if the indirect aim is to achieve military objectives , unless there is a pressing military need and , at the same time , a certain proportionality between the military objective to be achieved and the expected and foreseeable harm which may be caused to the civilian population .  
These confidence-building measures , which could lead to an informal suspension of offensive military operations , would constitute a demonstration of good will aimed at alleviating the suffering of the civilian population in areas affected by the armed confrontation , protecting human rights and facilitating the work of MINUGUA as well as all national entities devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights . 
Let me assure you that the Government is prepared to propose the necessary transitional or definitive amendments to the electoral law and is already working on the various legal formulae which , once the armed conflict is over , would enable URNG members to be reintegrated into society on a basis of full legality and without any restriction on their civil and political rights .  
Notes with concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes also that there is as yet no process or timetable for concluding the National Convention ;  
The Conference also took a position against violations of the human rights of women in armed conflicts and considered , inter alia , that systematic rape , sexual slavery or forced pregnancy are violations of the fundamental principles of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
Undoubtedly the establishment by the Security Council of ad hoc tribunals such as those for the former Yugoslavia and for Rwanda marks a momentous progress in the fight against human rights abuses and fleshes out the basic demand for international justice as a means of contributing to real and lasting peace in countries torn by armed conflict and beset by large-scale disregard of human dignity .  
Many countries allocate considerable proportions of public expenditures for food subsidies , but the bulk of those allocations go to civil servants , the police , families of the armed forces , and factory employees - in sum , largely to urban areas where they benefit middle - income groups , while the rural and urban poor benefit only marginally .  
Expressing grave concern that the number of armed conflicts has not decreased since the end of the cold war , and that international and ethnic conflicts are an ongoing reality in nearly every region , resulting in violations of human rights , especially those of women and children , including massive loss of life ,  
Among these are chronic hunger , malnutrition , illicit drug problems , organized crime , corruption , foreign occupation , armed conflicts , illicit arms trafficking , terrorism , intolerance and incitement to racial , ethnic , religious and other hatred , xenophobia , and endemic , communicable and chronic diseases .  
The first use of armed force by a State in contravention of the Charter shall constitute prima facie evidence of an act of aggression , although the Security Council may , in conformity with the Charter , conclude that a determination that an act of aggression has been committed would not be justified in the light of other relevant circumstances , including the fact that the acts concerned or their consequences are not of sufficient gravity .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the [ universal ] human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , including women migrant workers , women in poverty living in remote communities , [ destitute women ] , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and women living under foreign occupation or alien domination or where acts of terrorism occur , are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
international humanitarian and international human rights instruments to prevent all forms of violence against women in situations of armed and other types of conflict and undertake full investigations of all acts of violence against women committed during war , in particular [ systematic rape ] and sexual slavery , prosecute all criminals responsible for war crimes against women and provide full redress to women victims ;  
Encourage the future development of peace research involving the participation of women to examine the impact of armed conflict on women and children , and the nature and contribution of women 's participation in national , regional and international peace movements ; engage in research and identify innovative mechanisms for containing violence and for conflict resolution for public dissemination , for use by women and men ; ( d ) bis Develop and disseminate research on the physical , psychological ,  
Even though reliable statistics on the exact numbers of disabled persons in the region have yet to be compiled , indications are that in recent years cases of disability have increased dramatically in a number of African countries as a result of natural disasters , protracted internal armed conflict , famine and malnutrition , and the resurgence of once-controlled diseases such as tuberculosis .  
As a result of this most irresponsible approach to the fate of their country and its people on the part of the leaders of the armed groups , the peace process in Liberia remains deadlocked : the cease-fire has been broken , and an increase in hostilities has been reported , accompanied by human rights violations on a massive scale .  
The Constitution of El Salvador , amended pursuant to the peace agreements , gives the President of the Republic the power to use the armed forces for the maintenance of domestic peace , tranquillity , order and public safety " in exceptional cases , where the normal means [ for that purpose ] have been exhausted " .  
Subparagraph ( c ) was viewed as calling for further clarification : it was suggested that an exhaustive list of offences should be provided , to dispel the confusion created by the terms " serious violations " and " grave breaches " of the Geneva Conventions and to indicate whether the provision covered not only international but also internal armed conflicts taking into account the statute for the Rwanda Tribunal and the current reality of armed conflicts .  
It also demanded the immediate withdrawal of Bosnian Serb paramilitary units from areas surrounding that town and the cessation of armed attacks against it , requested the Secretary-General to take steps to increase the presence of UNPROFOR in Srebrenica and to arrange for the safe transfer of the ill and wounded , and decided to send a mission of Council members to ascertain , first hand , the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
The Council declared that Sarajevo and other such threatened areas , in particular the towns of Tuzla , Zepa , Gorazde , Bihac , as well as Srebrenica , should be treated as safe areas by all the parties concerned and should be free of armed attacks and from any other hostile act .  
The prudent action of the military authorities , who were aware of the guerrilla presence in the city and promptly informed MINUGUA , postponing the arrival of army troops at those points until after the URNG forces had withdrawn , avoided an armed confrontation that could have seriously endangered numerous civilians .  
We note with regret that half a year has passed since the signing of the Accra agreement , but that the Liberian parties have not implemented its basic provisions , thus demonstrating a clear disregard for the future of their own country and for the aspirations of its people , a people essentially held hostage to the personal political ambitions of the leaders of the armed factions .  
New hostages have been taken , United Nations observation posts manned by brave put poorly armed Dutch peace-keepers have been stampeded over , dozens of civilians have been murdered and hundreds have been wounded in the unprotected city , some of them while they were actually in the hospital : the inevitable and , as always , the favorite target of Karadzic 's artillery .  
The armed conflict in the north and south-west , which forced most of the country 's development projects to a brutal halt , coupled with the dire socio-political situations prevailing in Ethiopia and Somalia , accelerated markedly the deterioration of Djibouti 's economy .  
The mandate included the following : all violations of human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , and in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ; all forms of sexual harassment , exploitation and trafficking in women ; the elimination of gender bias in the administration of justice ; and the eradication of harmful effects of certain traditional or customary practices , cultural prejudice and religious extremism . 
The Federal Government expects and demands that , proceeding from Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations , the international community , and the Security Council in particular , take immediate and resolute measures to put an end to the aggression and the killing of the innocent civilian population and the prevention of ethnic cleansing and to see to it that Croatian armed forces withdraw to the separation lines established by the relevant resolutions of the Security Council .  
At a time when the Croatian authorities have resorted to the cruellest means - massive armed aggression - with a view to realizing the basic premise of their policy , that is , the creation of the ethnically pure State , Mr . Grani _ is attempting to divert the attention of the international community away from the humanitarian catastrophe and tragedy of the Krajina Serbs who have been forced to flee their ancestral homes .  
There have also been infamous cases in which State intelligence authorities or security forces , opposition groups , armed domestic resistance movements or criminal organizations hire mercenaries to engage in illegal actions such as forming paramilitary forces for purposes of repression , organizing death squads or providing military protection for illicit drug trafficking , smuggling or arms trafficking .  
Although the use of such a device conceals the mercenary 's real status , information such as the origin of the contractual relationship , the payment , the type of services agreed upon and the simultaneous use of other nationalities and passports , may serve as evidence in establishing the true nationality of persons involved in an armed conflict who are justifiably suspected of being mercenaries .  
Beginning in the 1960s , during the decolonization of Africa , the active presence of bands of mercenaries constituted a resource for the colonial interests that wished to remain in the region , hindering the process of self-determination from which new African States were emerging or giving rise to situations of destabilization and war in which the mercenary ingredient played a primary role in intensifying and internationalizing the armed conflict .  
While mercenaries are typically present in situations of armed conflict , it would be incorrect to limit the description to those cases alone , since it applies to any situation in which the sovereignty of States , the self-determination of peoples , political stability and the human rights of populations are affected in a premeditated fashion by operations in which the active agent is a foreign mercenary specially hired to carry out unlawful criminal acts .  
The international community should give further thought to the background and habitual course of the conflicts in Africa and support African efforts to secure rapid , effective agreements guaranteeing the right to self-determination , fundamental freedoms , democracy and development for all these peoples who , despite the attainment of independence some years ago , are unable to find peace with justice and development , mainly because of violence , foreign interests and armed conflicts .  
The presence of foreigners and alleged mercenaries in the 1991 war in Croatia and in the war in progress in Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1992 coincided with serious violations of international humanitarian law and the human rights of the peoples affected , and psychological warfare played a fundamental role in the development of the armed conflict . 
Similarly foreigners who joined the armed forces of a State as regular and permanent members and received material compensation similar to that promised or paid to combatants of similar ranks and functions in those armed forces , and who are not motivated to take part in the hostilities essentially by the desire for private gain or material compensation , should not be classified as mercenaries .  
The Code , reaffirming the continuing validity of the comprehensive concept of security , set politically binding norms and principles guiding the role of armed forces in democratic societies and the relation , among States as well as the relations of States vis - - vis their nationals in the military field .  
Although the threat of global conflict has been reduced , wars of aggression , armed conflicts , colonial or other forms of alien domination and foreign occupation , civil wars , terrorism and [ extremist violence ] continue to plague many parts of the world .  
The maintenance of peace and security at the global , regional and local levels , together with the prevention of policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing and the resolution of armed conflict , is crucial for the protection of the human rights of women and girl children , as well as for the elimination of all forms of violence against them and of their use as a weapon of war .  
Some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women in poverty living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , female children , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict are also particularly vulnerable to violence .  
The impact on women of environmental and natural resource degradation , deriving from , inter alia , unsustainable production and consumption patterns , drought , poor quality water , global warming , desertification , sea-level rise , hazardous waste , natural disasters , toxic chemicals and pesticide residues , radioactive waste , armed conflicts and its consequences ;  
The Islamic State of Afghanistan would like to assure you that the freedom-loving people of Afghanistan do realize their prime national obligation to liberate the western parts of Afghanistan , including occupied Herat , and to force the Pakistani militia out of the area by a general and resolute armed struggle , in favour of the country 's political and administrative unity .  
NULLThe meeting stressed the humanitarian element of the ever-growing problem caused by the presence of land-mines and other unexploded devices as a result of armed conflicts and expressed deep concern over the serious social and economic consequences for the populations of mine-infested countries .  
We are fully aware of the vital necessity of making all possible efforts , to put an end to existing armed conflicts , to avert such conflicts in the future and to overcome the remaining legacies of the Second World War as well as the manifestations of political , economic and social inequality and we call upon the States of the world :  
Hunger is the result of many factors : mismanagement of food production and distribution ; poor accessibility ; maldistribution of financial resources ; unwise exploitation of natural resources ; unsustainable patterns of consumption ; environmental pollution ; natural and human-made disasters ; conflicts between traditional and contemporary production systems ; irrational population growth ; and armed conflicts .  
In this context , the peace agreements set forth specific commitments whose purpose was ( a ) to establish the specific requirements for ending the armed conflict ; ( b ) to tackle some of the root causes of the conflict by starting from democratic principles ; and ( c ) to place special emphasis on the process of reconstruction as part of the economic and social development of the country .

Given the fact that Rwanda has been ravaged by the genocide and armed conflict in which systematic and gross violations of international human rights and humanitarian law were perpetrated , the challenges of the rehabilitation effort remain daunting .  
His delegation agreed that the crimes covered by the statute should be limited to war crimes , acts of genocide , violations of the laws and customs applicable in armed conflict , and crimes against humanity , all of which were forbidden under customary international law , and that treaty-based crimes such as those linked to drug trafficking and terrorism should be deleted .  
The spread of conflicts and the magnitude of the humanitarian consequences are such as to require the international community to conduct an objective and responsible evaluation and take vigorous and efficient measures to end the spiral of armed conflicts and create conditions for peace and security without which the universal realization of the right to development will be little more than a good intention . 
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger and disability , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Urges all the Afghan parties to work with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
erstwhile rivalry , sometimes violent , that had existed among the nine political parties formed during the struggle against the Soviet-backed Government , appeared to have changed into a conflict among three major armed groups : the Taliban , the forces controlled by General Dostum and his allies in the Supreme Coordination Council , and the government forces of President Rabbani .  
concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger and disability , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
fact that UNHCR had been required to deal with increasingly frequent emergency situations and large-scale repatriations demonstrated that , if a lasting solution was to be found , root causes of the refugee problem had to be addressed , whether they be armed conflict , economic and social deprivation or gross violations of human rights .  
in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy and stressing the fact that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable for reconstruction measures to have a lasting impact ,  
the global level , it was pushing for a ban on anti-personnel land-mines , an optional protocol to the Convention raising to 18 the minimum age of recruitment into armed forces , and a reordering of priorities away from military spending towards investment in human development .  
with mounting concern the prolongation , and in some regions the intensification , of armed hostilities among the parties in the country , including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law , which have caused significant civilian casualties , displaced populations and destruction of the economic and social infrastructure of the country , in spite of repeated calls by the Security Council and the Secretary-General for a cessation of hostilities ,

its previous relevant resolutions , as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights , particularly resolution 1995 / 88 , and the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights , which recognized that gross violations of human rights , including in armed conflicts , are among the multiple and complex factors leading to displacement of people , and the need for a comprehensive approach by the international community to address root causes and effects of movements of refugees and other displaced persons and the strengthening of emergency preparedness and response mechanisms ,  
Urges all the Afghan parties to work with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
Further condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian armed forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
Since women victims of conflict and refugees needed special protection , his delegation stressed the importance of the section of the Platform for Action concerned with the advancement of peace , conflict resolution and reduction of the impact of armed and other conflicts on women and would continue to support all measures to protect the basic rights of women .  Although it was primarily the responsibility of each country to ensure the proper institutional arrangements for the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , the United Nations had an invaluable coordinating role .  
BARGHOUTI ( Observer for Palestine ) , speaking on agenda item 107 , said that there had been considerable progress in the advancement of women since the first international women 's conference held in Mexico in 1975 , but that many problems remained ( armed conflict , civil and ethnic wars , new forms of racism and racial discrimination , foreign occupation and domination , extreme poverty , illiteracy , and increasing numbers of refugees and displaced women ) . 
PHAM ( Viet Nam ) said that Viet Nam had not been immune to the overwhelming refugee crisis which had affected the entire world and had worsened in recent years as a result of poverty , regional or internal armed conflicts , political , economic and social crises , violence and intolerance .  
A unique disciplinary code was also enacted ; it applies to all public servants , contractors providing services and all others who carry out public functions on a temporary or permanent basis with the exception of members of the armed forces , who are subject to special rules .  
The Committee identified as major factors and difficulties in implementing the Convention : the weak State machinery to effectively maintain the peace process ; the difficult process of national reconciliation ; the breakdown of public infrastructure and private support systems ; the large number of Rwandan refugees and internally displaced persons ; the great number of militias and some civilians who are still armed ; and the shattered economy and extreme poverty .  
The tension brought about by the presence of armed groups across the borders of other States , the tragedy of refugees and displaced persons seeking shelter in neighbouring countries and very often the consequent destruction of the environment , the spread of disease , the degeneration of moral values , the horror of suffering and behaviours far removed from human values are all situations not confined to the territorial limits of the States where conflicts occur .  
In the speech I delivered at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly , I stressed , on behalf of the Government of San Marino , the need to reconsider the instrument of the embargo , its effectiveness and repercussions , especially in those cases where , in the absence of armed conflict , international isolation alone has proved a valid moral and political means of international pressure .  
The predictable result has been an explosion in the number of armed conflicts , accompanied by widespread devastation , both human and physical , gross violations of human rights , and ethnic cleansing .  
Since this initiative came to the General Assembly for the first time as a result of Nicaragua 's urgent needs in 1990 at the end of its decade-long armed conflict and of its starting on the path to democracy and economic and social development , we have seen emergency assistance to be a temporary but very effective mechanism to help resolve the difficult problems of transition .  
Our own experience has proved that national reconciliation and the cessation of armed conflicts can be consolidated only through a genuine political commitment to economic development and social justice .  
We have studied the report of the Secretary-General contained in document A / 51 / 338 and share his positive view that for the first time in three decades the region is free from armed conflict , giving rise to institutional reforms that can make it possible for there to be new social and economic reform leading to sustainable development helped by support from the international community .  
The creation of basic social services schools , health centres and the provision of clean water is an important activity which the Government has carried out with the support of the international community in order to establish minimum conditions for the successful completion of the repatriation and resettlement of those Mozambicans who sought refuge in neighbouring countries during the armed conflict .  
The Republic of Belarus deeply appreciates the efforts made by all the programmes , funds and specialized agencies of the United Nations system towards providing increased , speedier and better quality assistance to the various countries and regions suffering from armed conflicts , natural disasters , industrial ecological catastrophes and other emergency circumstances .  
Concerned by the increasing suffering of millions of victims of natural disasters , emergency situations and armed conflicts and by the attendant loss of life , flows of refugees , mass displacement of populations and infrastructure devastation , the United Arab Emirates declares its support for international efforts to assess and enhance the capacity of the United Nations and its specialized agencies to address these grave international humanitarian problems and to strengthen the participation of the international community .  
While the Dayton Peace Agreement has laid a constructive basis for the cessation of armed hostilities and the creation of a favourable climate for the formation of a stable and durable structure of state in Bosnia and Herzegovina , a great deal needs to be done to translate the pious desire of the international community into a working reality .  
There was also a broad understanding between the concerned parties that the next step would be the formation of a political commission or a broad-based , fully representative council , although some differences still exist on composition and sequence , as well as on the issue of demobilization of armed militias , the collection of heavy weapons , demilitarization and the establishment of a national security force .  
She paid tribute to the remarkable analytical work accomplished by the expert designated by the Secretary-General in her objective and poignant study of the impact of armed conflict on children , which recommended to the international community a far-reaching programme of action touching on all aspects of the question . 
An additional problem linked to the existence of settlements was the violent acts committed by settlers , who were consistently protected by the army , were often armed and who had become more violent and aggressive during the preceding year .  
PAIK ( Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan ) said that Afghanistan was in a desperate situation on account of the continued armed conflict with its attendant massacres , disappearances and violations of human rights , and that the land mines which were still widely scattered throughout the country , despite the heroic operations of the demining programmes conducted by United Nations agencies and numerous non-governmental organizations still posed a danger .  
Responding to allegations that the armed forces of Myanmar had committed unseemly acts in border areas , he rejected them and insisted that the local population in those areas was experiencing unprecedented levels of progress in the political , economic and social fields and that the armed forces of Myanmar , which had a distinguished history and a fine tradition born of the struggle for independence , were well known for their good discipline and exemplary conduct .  
It was currently preparing an integrated plan of action to combat the so-called " paramilitary " groups that had sown death and terror in rural areas , and planned to reactivate a special armed group capable of tackling those groups successfully .  
The Committee identified as major factors and difficulties in implementing the Convention : ( a ) the weak State machinery to effectively maintain the peace process , including national reconciliation efforts ; ( b ) the breakdown of mutual support systems ; ( c ) the large number of Rwandan refugees and internally displaced persons ; ( d ) the great number of militias and some civilians who are still armed ; ( e ) the shattered economy and extreme poverty .  
Resolutions of those organs have drawn the attention of Governments , the United Nations system and the general public to those problems and have called for action with regard to extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law as major obstacles to human rights .  
Lightly armed peace-keepers and unarmed civilians were sent into areas of active warfare , where their courageous efforts helped to save untold human lives and to alleviate the suffering of the civilian population .  
In this respect , we regard as encouraging the agreement reached between the Government and UNITA to establish a new timetable in order to move the peace process forward , as well as the resumption of bilateral negotiations to complete the establishment of joint armed forces .  The recent conclusion of an agreement to this end between the two parties is a positive step , which , in spite of certain difficulties which emerged , deserves to be encouraged and supported .  
Expresses deep concern at the numerous delays in the implementation of the Lusaka Protocol , reminds the Government of Angola and UNITA of their obligations to consolidate the peace process and , in this regard , urges them to maintain an effective cease-fire , conclude their military talks on integration of the armed forces , undertake active engagement in the demining process , and commence the integration of UNITA personnel into administrative and governmental institutions in furtherance of the objective of national reconciliation ;

Hiding behind a " living shield " of members of the Government forces , they are continuing attacks which are compelling the command of the armed forces of the Republic of Tajikistan to abandon the positions occupied by it in order to avoid unjustified losses of life among military personnel and the civilian population .  
Noting with mounting concern the prolongation , and in some regions the intensification , of armed hostilities among the parties in the country , including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and other violations of international humanitarian law which have caused significant civilian casualties , displaced populations and destruction of the economic and social infrastructure of the country , in spite of repeated calls by the Security Council and the Secretary-General for a cessation of hostilities ,  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
[ Civil , ethnic and religious strife , nuclear armament , armed conflicts , alien and colonial domination , foreign occupation , international economic imbalance , coercive economic measures , poverty , organized crime , and terrorism in all its forms are destructive to sustainable human settlements development and should therefore be renounced by all States . ]  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger and disability , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
In the months preceding the suspension of hostilities ( see para . 45 ) , there was a relative increase , on the part of URNG , in armed clashes , harassment , the installation of roadblocks and the occupation of residential areas for propaganda purposes which sometimes endangered civilians , for instance , when they were caught in the line of fire or when military units were located near populated areas .  
Urges all the Afghan parties to work with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
Further condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , including killings , the burning and looting of houses , the shelling of residential areas , harassment of and attacks on refugees , the elderly and the infirm perpetrated by members of the Croatian armed forces and civilians in the formerly Serb-controlled regions of Croatia during and subsequent to the military operations there in August 1995 ;  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
I believe that it would be a grievous setback for the Organization if , because of the current financial debate , it became impossible to retain MICIVIH , whose presence is essential to consolidate the Organization 's and Members States ' remarkable achievements in Haiti , and MINUGUA , whose presence is fundamental to realization of the best prospects that have ever existed to bring to an end the armed confrontation which has afflicted the people of Guatemala for 35 years .  
The Government of Guatemala considers that the foregoing reaffirms the mutual trust between the parties that characterizes the current phase of the negotiations , and reiterates its commitment to achieve as soon as possible a negotiated political solution to the internal armed confrontation , in order to strengthen the building of a firm and lasting peace .  
50 To this definition , the Platform for Action additionally includes the violation of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , in particular , murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ; forced sterilization and forced abortion , coercive / forced use of contraceptives , female infanticide and prenatal sex selection .  
As an official and categorical denial of the shameless accusations that have been made against the Burundian army , which certain circles have all too gratuitously and tendentiously blamed for the recent deaths in Cibitoke province , the Minister for Foreign Affairs states that , on the contrary , the forces of order have rescued many other citizens threatened by armed terrorist groups that have infiltrated into Burundi from abroad .  
While unnecessary , wanton humiliations of the law-breaking State would surely be inappropriate , one finds it difficult to see - for example - how a State guilty of such a crime as a deliberate armed attack and invasion , or deliberate , systematic , massive violations of human rights or self-determination should not be required to offer guarantees that , while preserving its independent statehood and territorial integrity , could be viewed as incompatible with such a formal attribute of a State as its " dignity " .  
The members of the Council urge you to fulfil your recent unilateral commitment to quarter 50,000 troops at the latest by 15 June 1996 and to increase significantly the number of workable weapons and other military equipment turned over by UNITA troops to UNAVEM III . The members of the Security Council are also concerned that the military talks on the modalities for the integration of UNITA troops into the Angolan armed forces were not concluded on 15 May 1996 in accordance with the timetable agreed by all parties on the Joint Commission earlier this month . 
The progress achieved in the peace negotiations and the temporary suspension of offensive and counterrevolutionary activity have created new conditions capable of permitting decisive progress in fulfilling the commitment to eradicate the suffering the internal armed confrontation has caused for the civilian population and of building confidence in the peace process .  
This is reflected , in particular , in the sharp reduction in political violence ( although the phenomenon of banditry and the abductions of election observers and officials which have punctuated the electoral campaign are still causing concern ) , the high level of public freedom , the increasingly independent functioning of the branches of Government , the strengthening of local authorities and the reduction and conversion of the armed forces .  
This was a joint effort of the United Nations Children 's Fund ( UNICEF ) and UNIFEM . It includes information on women and human rights , women and political participation , gender-based violence , women and armed conflict , reproductive rights and sexual rights , culture and traditional practices , the girl child , women 's rights in relation to children 's rights , and legal status versus legal reality . 
On 25 July , at around 4.30 p.m . local time in Bujumbura , my Special Representative , Mr . Marc Faguy , was informed that the armed forces had put in power a presidential candidate of their choice , deployed heavily armed units , set up roadblocks across the city and moved into the national television station .  
At a public sitting on 8 July 1996 , the International Court of Justice recognized that for the first time in history , the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict , and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law , while also recognizing that there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament .  
On the contrary , armed forces fighting the Afghan Government would find such a situation very convenient for further expanding their acts of aggression including the firing of artillery and rockets on the civilian population of the capital and other acts against the humanitarian laws .  NULLAs far as the implementation of the arms embargo against the armed groups fighting the Government is concerned , these groups are not legal subjects of international law .  
However , the implementation of return-and-reintegration programmes was subsequently disrupted because of increased political instability and armed conflict , in particular in southern Somalia , provoking renewed population movements , mainly towards relatively peaceful areas in the north-east and north-west , but also within the southern regions of the country .  
" Despite the proximity of Panamanian territory to jungle areas of Colombia where organized armed groups are operating , Panama has so far not experienced any acts that would fall into the category of international terrorism , aside from threats received through anonymous calls that bombs have been planted in various public buildings and places .  
I would recall that the Iraqi Government has stated on numerous occasions that the imposition of such zones is a unilateral act that should be considered to be an ongoing act of armed aggression directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq and contravenes the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international law .  
I should like to take this opportunity to draw your attention also to the question of the two no-flight zones which the United States of America and the United Kingdom have imposed on Iraq and which the Iraqi Government has on numerous occasions said are the result of a unilateral act based on the continued use of armed force for the purpose of attacking Iraq 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence , in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
The Government of Iraq has repeatedly stated that the imposition of these " no-fly zones " constitutes a continuing unilateral act of aggressive armed force directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq , in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
The Government of Iraq has repeatedly stated that the imposition of these " no-fly zones " constitutes a continuing unilateral act of aggressive armed force directed against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law .  
The United Nations is the main international organization requested by Governments to undertake tasks such as facilitating dialogue between warring parties , preventing renewal of internal armed conflict , strengthening infrastructure , improving local security and facilitating electoral processes .  
The experience he has acquired over eight years prompts the Special Rapporteur to assert that situations involving , for example , armed conflict , terrorism , or violence linked to extremist intolerance foster a growing reliance on the use of mercenaries , which for our purposes means seeking out foreign experts who are paid for services of destructive violence and deadly effectiveness .  
Although they directly confirmed that the submarine of the north side was stranded off Kangrung while drifting after engine trouble on 18 September , they branded it as an " armed spy boat " and started a provocative campaign .  
His delegation believed that terrorism could be defined as the commission of acts of murder , assassination , bombing , hostage-taking or the seizure of aircraft or ships in order to provoke a state of terror for political purposes , whether by individuals or States and whether against other individuals or other States , in circumstances other than those of legitimate armed conflict for liberation from all forms of foreign domination or from colonial , occupying , racist or other forces , and , in particular , when undertaken by liberation movements recognized by regional and international organizations .  
While rebels or armed gangs are not similarly bound by these obligations , they nevertheless are required to respect certain humanitarian principles arising from international customary law and recognized by all civilized nations .  
Since then , agreements have been concluded on human rights ; the resettlement of persons displaced by the armed conflict ; the establishment of the historical clarification commission ; the identity and rights of indigenous peoples ; social and economic aspects and the agrarian situation ; and now , the strengthening of civilian power and the role of the armed forces in a democratic society .  
It is vitally important to strengthen civilian power as the expression of the will of the people through the exercise of political rights , reinforce the legislative branch , reform the administration of justice and guarantee public security , all of which are crucial for the enjoyment of civil liberties and rights ; and , within a democratic institutional framework , it is incumbent upon the Guatemalan armed forces to discharge the essential task of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity ,  
Such practices are also liable to generate a worrying state of affairs , not only for Iraq , but also for Turkey and the region as a whole , which is primarily afflicted by the irregular situation created by the Americans and their allies in northern Iraq , not to mention the human injury to which Iraqi citizens are exposed as a result of the illegitimate activities of the Turkish armed forces and their military operations inside the territory of the Republic of Iraq . 
The Armed Forces High Command was urged to take concrete measures aimed at protecting and promoting the rights of persons belonging to minorities by eliminating discrimination against the members of minority groups and taking positive administrative steps to ensure that the armed forces were genuinely representative of the national community in their ethnic , linguistic , religious , regional and national composition .  
The fundamental changes in the world scene and the promise they held in the early 1990s , which many celebrated as the " new world order " , must not be allowed to degenerate into a dismal landscape of internal armed conflicts , widespread ethnic rivalries , unbridled nationalism and a multitude of humanitarian problems adversely affecting human well-being in all continents .  
At its fifty-second session , the Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 71 , of 23 April 1996 expressed its outrage that the abominable , deliberate and systematic practice of rape had been used as a weapon of war in Bosnia and Herzegovina , recognized that rape in the context of armed conflict constituted a war crime and called for the protection and care of rape victims , respect for the special needs of victims of sexual violence in the investigation and prosecution of alleged violations and punishment of those responsible . 
Fed with misinformation from unscrupulous sources and armed groups that are in opposition to the Government , blinded by prejudice and preconceived notions and motivated by ulterior political reasons , some countries regrettably continue to make unfounded accusations . 
The Conference expressed concern at the escalation of armed hostilities in Afghanistan , which had resulted in immense human losses and irreparable damage to the country in the economic , social and cultural spheres , and endangered regional peace , stability and security .  
The four main areas identified by the Committee at its first general discussion , namely the adequacy of international standards , the prevention of the involvement of children in armed conflicts , their effective protection , as well as their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration were addressed in the study , and were the subject of specific recommendations by Ms . Machel .  
The problem lay in the grey areas and the limits that had to be set to prevent such advisers from becoming active in internal armed conflicts or in internal security affairs that affected the exercise of internationally recognized civil and political rights and freedoms .  
In the light of events in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , serious thought should be given to the current state and future direction of the development of the criminal aspects of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
His delegation particularly welcomed the inclusion of crimes against United Nations and associated personnel and the use in armed conflict of methods and means of warfare calculated to cause widespread , long-term and severe damage to the natural environment , particularly in the light of their emergence as crimes under customary international law .  
With regard to the use of mercenaries as a means of violating human rights and impeding the exercise of peoples to self-determination , the report of the Special Rapporteur gave ample proof of the growing involvement of mercenaries in armed conflict , especially internal armed conflict , and raised important questions on the gaps in national and international legislation relating to such activities , and as to whether the existence of companies selling security services to countries in exchange for concessions should be tolerated .  
The problems facing sub-Saharan Africa were manifold : foreign debt service , slow economic growth , inadequate social investment , drought and environmental degradation , the growing HIV / AIDS epidemic , political instability and armed conflict .  
Mr . WILMOT ( Ghana ) , commending the expert of the Secretary-General for her report on the impact of armed conflict on children ( A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) , observed that it went beyond the five main issues originally listed in General Assembly resolution 48 / 157 to address other pertinent issues such as rape and other forms of gender-based violence and sexual exploitation , economic sanctions and measures to ensure the education , health , nutrition and psychological well-being of such children .  
His delegation welcomed the comprehensive report on the impact of armed conflict on children ( A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) , prepared by the Secretary-General 's expert , and supported her proposal that a special representative on the subject should be appointed .  
In assuming its complete role , with the completion of AICC construction work , the detention facilities , increased activity with the commencement of trials , and taking into consideration the general political situation of the region , additional security personnel would be required for facilities and access control , armed escort , personal protection and simultaneous courtroom operations .  
These are the cause of confrontations and armed conflicts that unfortunately create an exodus of thousands of human beings who take to the roads : men , women , children and old people are left abandoned , adrift in despair wandering waves of humanity searching for safe or supposedly safe places , forced to survive crushed together , sometimes like cattle , in camps where the conditions were just described by our colleague from Zaire as subhuman .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism , and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Welcomes the report of the expert of the Secretary-General on the impact of armed conflict on children , [ 9 ] / and takes note with appreciation of the recommendations included therein that address the prevention of the involvement of children in armed conflicts , the reinforcement of preventive measures , the relevance and adequacy of existing standards , the measures required to improve the protection of children affected by armed conflicts and the actions needed to promote the physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of children affected by armed conflicts ; 
Both major parties in the Government had made unequivocal statements that the coming national and municipal elections in 1998 would be free and fair , and had asked the armed forces and members of the electoral commission to remain neutral . 
ICRC had also been developing a model manual for the armed forces on the law of armed conflicts , designed primarily for use by senior officers with tactical responsibilities , and intended as a reference tool for the military commander without legal background .  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
Please provide information on the measures adopted pursuant to article 38 , including of a legislative , administrative and educational nature , to respect and ensure respect for the rules of international humanitarian law applicable to the State in armed conflicts which are relevant to the child .  
Please provide information on all the measures adopted pursuant to article 38 , paragraph 4 , and in accordance with the State 's obligations under international humanitarian law to protect the civilian population in armed conflicts , including measures of a legislative , administrative , budgetary and other nature , to ensure the protection and care of children who are affected by an armed conflict .  
Welcomes the proposed measures outlined by the Government of Cambodia in its comments [ 6 ] on the report of the Special Representative to ensure that the forthcoming communal and national elections are free and fair , that members of the armed forces remain neutral during the election campaign , that the individual vote is confidential and that local and international observers are welcomed ;  
In the context of ending 35 years of armed conflict , it emphasizes in particular the need to overhaul the security functions of the State : under a reformed Constitution , the police are to be restructured , strengthened and consolidated in a new National Civil Police , which will assume responsibility for internal security ; intelligence gathering activities are to be reorganized and regulated ; and the army will limit its role to external defence and will adjust its doctrine , training , deployment , size and budget accordingly .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Welcomes the report of the expert of the Secretary-General on the impact of armed conflict on children , [ 23 ] and takes note with appreciation of the recommendations included therein that address the prevention of the involvement of children in armed conflict , the reinforcement of preventive measures , the relevance and adequacy of existing standards , the measures required to improve the protection of children affected by armed conflict and the actions needed to promote the physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of children affected by armed conflict ;  
Welcomes the proposed measures outlined by the Government of Cambodia in its comments [ 52 ] on the report of the Special Representative to ensure that the forthcoming communal and national elections are free and fair , that members of the armed forces remain neutral during the election campaign , that the individual vote is confidential and that local and international observers are welcomed ;  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of its objectives is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes also with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
Deeply deplore the loss of so many human lives , the material damage and the indescribable suffering caused by armed conflicts in the subregion , which are generating millions of refugees and displaced persons , and express our deep gratitude to the countries and peoples of the subregion for their generous and fraternal hospitality and welcome . 
Bearing in mind that the objective of those programmes is to develop within each country a national mechanism to manage and execute an integrated programme of mine clearance and that , as a consequence of armed conflicts , the affected countries are facing considerable economic constraints , only the effective contribution of the international community can enable us gradually to overcome the serious problems caused by existing landmines .  
However , the easy availability of weapons , the high incidence of armed criminal activity and the fact that the first police officers graduated only 18 months ago are clear indications that the HNP faces formidable challenges in its efforts to maintain a secure and stable environment .  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Bearing in mind also the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Intervention , which in the Court 's view was illegal when it utilized coercive means , could take less blatant forms than the use of armed force , such as unilateral recourse to economic sanctions - a less dramatic but much more effective means , especially in relations between States of unequal power .  
The same was true of other violations of the law of armed conflict mentioned in the new draft , i.e . , the employment of poisonous weapons calculated to cause unnecessary suffering or the wanton destruction of cities , towns or villages not justified by military necessity .  
IV of the Constitution of the United Mexican States provide that public service in the armed forces is compulsory ; that it is an obligation for Mexicans to receive military instruction making them fit to exercise the rights of citizens skilled in the handling of weapons and proficient in military discipline ; that males who are Mexicans and have reached 18 years of age shall be considered to be citizens of the Republic and that it is a prerogative of those persons to bear arms in the armed forces for the defence of the Republic and its institutions .  
National military service serves to enrol personnel in the armed forces , is instituted by constitutional declaration contained in the fourth paragraph of article 5 of the Constitution of the United Mexican States , which provides that the only public service which may be compulsory , under the terms of the respective laws , is military service , which requires all the country 's inhabitants to assist in the defence of the fatherland .  
Panama recommends the inclusion of provisions , as very special legislation , that are directed at committing States to social policy allocating greater budgetary resources to finance institutions for the physical and psychological rehabilitation of children who are victims of armed conflicts , and supports efforts to implement State social policy giving concrete form to the real will of Governments . Sixth .  
With respect to the age of recruitment into the armed forces ( art . , UNHCR , consistent with the position stated above , insists that the minimum age for either compulsory or voluntary recruitment into the armed forces should be set at 18 years , and does not agree that earlier recruitment should be acceptable with parental consent . 
In its resolution 1996 / 71 , the Commission expressed very deep concern at information on rape and abuse of women in the areas of armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia , in particular in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina , and considered outrageous the abominable , deliberate and systematic practice of rape used as a weapon of war which , in this context , constituted a war crime .  
The functions assigned by the Decree to the Commission relate to the implementation and enforcement of international humanitarian law on the basis of proposals submitted to the national authorities on legislative and regulatory provisions and measures to guarantee the implementation of the basic international instruments in this regard .  NULLAs to the wording of the resolution under consideration , it is important to draw attention to its authors ' awareness of the exclusion from the scope of Protocol II of situations of internal disturbances and tensions , as not being armed conflicts .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing due to a number of complex factors which include , inter alia , armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources , and environmental degradation .  
Conscious of the human rights and dignity of all refugee children and adolescents and that , due to their specific needs and vulnerability within the broader refugee population , they need to be among the first to receive protection and assistance in any refugee situation , Gravely concerned that refugee children and adolescents continue to be exposed to family separation , physical violence and other violations of their human rights , including through sexual abuse and exploitation , and military or armed attacks ,  
The delegation that had introduced a revised version of document A / AC . 252 / L . 2 ( A / AC . 252 / 1997 / WP . 10 and 12 ) as a result of the first round of discussions noted that the changes introduced in article 1 , paragraph 4 , contained an enlarged definition of armed forces that included the security forces and restricted the concept of other persons accompanying them to those who acted in support of the armed forces and were under their command and control .  
Mongolia is pursuing a policy of maintaining the size of its armed forces and its defence expenditures at the lowest possible level and of ensuring its independence and national security primarily by political and diplomatic means .  
Throughout the past few years , successive world events have indicated that disasters caused by people resorting to armed force in their ethnic , civil , ideological or border wars have been increasing in a manner unprecedented in modern history .  
We must therefore concentrate our efforts on the causes , such as poverty , armed conflicts , economic sanctions , economic imbalances , ethnic conflicts , environmental problems , desertification , deforestation , inadequate international cooperation and , above all , the problems of indebtedness , technology transfers , the provision of international financial aid to developing countries and the exploitation of basic resources and unfair terms of trade , all of which lead to greater flows of refugees across international borders , as the current international situation shows .  
The ICRC is particularly concerned with emergency situations arising from armed conflict and internal violence , which are often marked by widespread and urgent needs among the civilian population and by the breakdown of political , economic and civic institutions .  
We must see to it that these trends are strengthened and that the way is cleared for specific , tangible steps that would make it possible to move to address in practical terms the question of the cessation of the armed conflict and the start of a political dialogue aimed at national reconciliation and the establishment in Afghanistan of a broad-based , fully representative government .  
As we can see , these hidden weapons of mass destruction continue to cause irreversible damage in Central America , even though the Esquipulas process to achieve final peace in the region has already achieved its objective , putting an end to the armed conflict in Guatemala , and even though it is now seven and five years , respectively , since the civil wars ended in Nicaragua and El Salvador . The cruelty of these weapons is overwhelming . 
The International Court of Justice has declared in a historic advisory opinion that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would be contrary to the rules of international law applicable to armed conflicts .  
The elimination of our armed forces and the demilitarization of our society have fostered a broad , pluralistic , representative system in the form of a democratic and social state of law , which is the legal structure representing the will for peace , conciliation and harmonious coexistence Costa Ricans have chosen .  
It has the intention of continuing the dialogue initiated there on a number of bilateral issues , including trade , which is in perfect agreement with our foreign policy agenda , which will seek , after overcoming our internal armed confrontation , to pursue a better understanding and strengthening of our international relations , thus contributing to a better understanding among peoples , including a brighter future for China and Guatemala . I should be grateful if you would arrange for this letter to be circulated as a document of the Security Council . 
Under international humanitarian law applicable in international armed conflicts , in particular article 123 of the Third and article 140 of the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 , this Geneva-based organization is the principal agency authorized to collect all the information it can obtain through official or private channels concerning prisoners of war and protected civilians .  
In a democratic society , the typical functions of the armed forces relate to the defence of sovereignty and territorial integrity ; any other function is atypical and exceptional ; like any other government institution , their exercise of other functions must take place in a context of subordination to lawfully constituted authority and be preceded by a decision of and be monitored by the lawfully constituted authorities of the State within their specific sphere of competence . 
Taking into account the new functions of the Guatemalan armed forces , as set forth in the Agreement on the Strengthening of Civilian Power and on the Role of the Armed Forces in a Democratic Society , and considering the Parties ' shared objective of promoting the broadest possible participation of citizens in the electoral process , the Commission is invited to examine the desirability of granting , in the future , members of the Guatemalan armed forces on active duty the political right of voting in Guatemalan elections .  
Whereas the internal armed conflict that Guatemala has experienced for over three decades resulted from the closing of political opportunities for democratic expression and participation and from the adoption of measures of political repression against individuals and organizations linked or identified with the Government overthrown in 1954 ,  
Also in relation to the clause mentioned in paragraph 20 , the National Reconciliation Act shall extinguish criminal liability for related common crimes committed in the armed conflict , such crimes being defined as those which are directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to the commission of the political crimes referred to in the preceding paragraph and which can not be shown to be motivated by personal goals .  
In respect of persons who were involved in the internal armed conflict owing to institutional mandates , the National Reconciliation Act shall contain specific provisions equivalent to those previously mentioned , in that they shall extinguish criminal liability for common crimes perpetrated with the aim of preventing , thwarting , suppressing or punishing the commission of political crimes and related common crimes , where such crimes were directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to that aim , unless it is demonstrated that there is no relationship between the criminal act and the stated aim .  
The Agreements contain not only such provisions as the parties considered to be necessary for ending the legal situation of domestic armed conflict and remedying its effects , but also a much longer set of provisions which set out a State plan which encapsulates many of the recommendations contained in the reports submitted to the Commission on Human Rights , and in particular several relating to the structural changes needed to ensure the effective exercise of human rights .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
RECOGNIZING the importance of observance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights and other international human rights instruments , as well as respect for international humanitarian law applicable to armed conflicts , and bearing in mind the complementarity between human rights and international humanitarian law in improving protection of the individual and respect for his dignity in situations of armed conflict ,  
Experience has shown that the United Nations has long placed special emphasis on the implementation of discretionary measures ( negotiations , retortion , provisional measures under Article 40 of the Charter of the United Nations , non-binding sanctions imposed in accordance with General Assembly resolutions and implemented individually or collectively by States , and so on ) and only in exceptional cases resorted to the use of mandatory sanctions and other enforcement measures not involving the use of armed force .  
However , if the application of mandatory sanctions in the case of an armed invasion of the territory of another State and a direct breach of international peace can be considered warranted from the point of view of the Charter and international law , in most other cases this can be - and has been - counterproductive and has had negative and destructive consequences not only for one or several States but for the entire international community .  
What is remarkable is that although Zaire is losing on the battlefield , the head of State has emerged stronger : stronger with the armed forces , which call for his leadership ; stronger in international affairs , since he is seen as the only person capable of resolving a regional crisis ; and stronger in politics , since even his most critical opponents have joined him in the effort of national reconciliation .  
The purpose of the workshop was once again to make the international community more aware of the very serious violations of human rights and humanitarian law which are committed by Government authorities , armed groups or individuals in situations of internal disturbances , crises and tensions , including latent or low _ intensity conflicts .  
He noted that humanitarian law initially had been developed in response to ordinary international armed conflicts wherein organized regular armies faced each other , and the content of humanitarian law clearly reflected its origin .  
Australia 's own decision to suspend the use of anti _ personnel landmines and to support the negotiation of a global ban as soon as possible was not taken without considerable soul _ searching given that the defence challenge for Australia is to be able to protect a vast continent with a small professional armed force .  
Those mechanisms will have to be established in a broad and realistic manner , with the help of international cooperation , and will have to cover not only financial compensation but also measures to support and assist those families and communities which suffered the worst consequences of the internal armed conflict .  
The Mission hopes that the Guatemalan armed forces , in the context of their considerable efforts to put an end to the internal armed conflict and to accept the institutional changes set forth in the Peace Agreements , will noticeably increase their cooperation in clarifying and punishing crimes and human rights violations in which some of their members may be implicated .  
As mentioned in his previous report , the Special Rapporteur continued to receive reports and information on grave and widespread violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms by government agents , and abuses and atrocities committed against the life , liberty and security of individuals by members of different parties to the armed conflict in the country other than the Government of the Sudan in the areas under their control .  
Four working groups have been constituted within the Committee to assess the state of human rights education in the following areas : primary and secondary schools ; universities and higher education ; adult education , including several professional groups ( police , armed forces , judges , teachers , social workers , etc . ) ; and activities undertaken by NGOs , associations and trade unions .  
In its response , UNICEF referred to the report prepared by the expert of the Secretary-General , Ms . Gra \ x { 84f7 } Michel , on the impact of armed conflict on children , submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 48 / 157 ( see A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) .  Although the report gives extensive information on violations of the rights of women and children , it does not provide specific information pertinent to the release of women and children taken hostage in armed conflict and imprisoned .  
With respect to the release of women and children taken hostage during armed conflicts and imprisoned , an important step for improving the situation would be for the Governments concerned to ratify without delay and to implement all relevant international instruments and Conventions , and for practical and cost-effective measures to be taken to collect information on women and children hostages on a systematic basis .  Non-governmental organizations working in the field might also contribute to that effort .  
As for the plenary and the workshop topics , the International Federation recommended the following topics : ( a ) global money-laundering , suggested practical measures to combat it ; ( b ) improving extradition measures to deal with fugitives at large ; ( c ) combating organized transnational crime and links with terrorist crime ; ( d ) the ill effects of drug trafficking ; ( e ) combating bribery and corruption in all forms ; and ( f ) combating violent crimes , such as murder , gang rape with violence , armed robbery and extortion .  
In light of article 39 of the Convention , the Committee is worried about the insufficient measures taken to provide physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration to children victims of any form of neglect , abuse and / or exploitation , particularly victims of armed conflicts , sexual exploitation and child labour .  
Accordingly , and as long as the faction leaders , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their conflict in Somalia and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law related to internal armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia irrespective of whether the specific area is engulfed in active fighting .  
Expresses its concern that most of the representatives duly elected in 1990 are still excluded from participating in the meetings of the National Convention , created to prepare basic elements for the drafting of a new constitution , and that one of the objectives of the Convention is to maintain the participation of the armed forces in a leading role in the future political life of the State , and notes also with concern that the working procedures of the National Convention do not permit the elected representatives of the people freely to express their views ;  
The topics discussed included the question of the minimum age of those participating in hostilities , the issue of direct or indirect involvement in hostilities , the age of recruitment , be it voluntary or compulsory , into the armed forces , and whether or not a clause should be included in the draft optional protocol preventing child recruitment by non-governmental armed groups .  
50 The expert encouraged the working group , in drafting the optional protocol , to take a realistic approach in relation to non-governmental armed groups , in the light of the fact that the vast majority of contemporary armed conflicts were internal . 
In the statement at its fifty _ second session , the Commission expressed its deep concern that the disproportionate use of force by the Russian Federation armed forces was continuing to lead to grave violations of human rights , as well as of international humanitarian law .  
Taking into consideration the modest financial capabilities of the State , in this short period it has been impossible to supply the appropriate equipment and arms for the armed forces of the Republic of Macedonia at a level that would provide for an appropriate initial reaction or a possible urgent military action ;  
He called for increasing contacts across the Taiwan Straits and negotiations that would lead to reunification in which Taiwan would ' exercise a high degree of autonomy and enjoy legislative and independent judicial power , including that of final adjudication ' and ' may also retain its armed forces and administer its party , governmental and military systems by itself ' .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Also condemns all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , recognizes them to be violations of international human rights and humanitarian law and calls for a particularly effective response to violations of this kind , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy ;  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Regarding crimes against humanity , article 3 of the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda stresses the prosecution of persons responsible for crimes " when committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against any civilian population on national , political , ethnic , racial or religious grounds " , that is , it does not associate those crimes primarily with armed conflicts .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 3 June 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , giving details of the aerial violations that have accompanied the incursions into Iraq 's territory by the Turkish armed forces and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and to halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
The expropriation of land and sources of water continues ; educational and health facilities are inadequate ; the inhabitants encounter major economic difficulties ; environmental degradation is being caused by the burial of toxic wastes in the Golan ; prisoners in Israeli jails are being held in extremely cruel conditions ; and Syrian citizens are subjected to provocation by armed Israeli settlers .  
The second obstacle was the fallacious and perverse argument that the country was experiencing internally a state of dirty , unconventional war compelling the authorities to suspend the exercise of human rights and to claim , before international forums , that international humanitarian law conventions were not applicable since the situation did not involve an international armed conflict and even less a declared war .  
Thus , both international war and internal armed conflicts , just as states of tension or domestic disturbances caused by political , economic , social or cultural factors , when accompanied by clashes , acts of violence , vandalism , inter _ ethnic confrontations , terrorist attacks , etc . and provided they represent an actual or at any rate imminent threat to the community as a whole , constitute a public danger or public emergency in the meaning conferred on those terms by the international instruments referred to above .  
A relatively intense internal armed conflict ( where it is assumed that the intensity of hostilities and the level of organization of the combatants is below that required by the above Protocol ) , in which case the provisions set forth in article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions apply .  
Where this appears most clearly is in severe crisis situations involving relatively serious armed conflicts , where the international law on human rights and international humanitarian law are applied in a simultaneous and complementary manner .  
Given the complementary and non _ exclusive nature of the protective norms of international law , it is extremely important to consider the positive linkage that exists with international humanitarian law and , in particular , at what point article 3 common to the four Geneva Conventions , which also establishes fundamental guarantees during internal armed conflicts , enters into force .  
The Agreement on the Definitive Ceasefire was implemented and the deadlines and procedures established therein were strictly observed , confirming the willingness of the Government and URNG to put a definitive end to the armed conflict , as evidenced throughout 1996 in the peace negotiations and in the informal ceasefire which went into effect on 19 March 1996 .  
The professionalism of the role the army now plays in national life was made clear by its comportment during the electoral process of March 1997 : in marked contrast to the record of military interference in the history of El Salvador , the army demonstrated its respect for the democratic decision of the Salvadorian people that those elections represented .  8 .  Before the signing of the peace agreements , public security functions were carried out by bodies dependent on the armed forces .  
It recommended a profound judicial reform that would give the judicial system the capacity to sanction violations of human rights ; constitutional reforms in a number of areas ; the strengthening of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights ; the adoption of reforms in the armed forces and in the public security sector ; the investigation of illegal armed groups , or death squads ; and concrete measures to achieve national reconciliation .  
Even under the situation where the United States and the south Korean authorities defiantly opposed the DPRK 's proposal for tripartite talks , the great leader took the positive step of mobilizing 150,000 Korean People 's armymen for peaceful construction in 1986 to defuse the tension on the Korean peninsula and advanced a proposal on 23 July 1987 for a massive phased reduction of the armed forces and declared a unilateral reduction of 100,000 of the People 's Army forces as a subsequent practical measure .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing unstable and tense security conditions in the Gali region , characterized by acts of violence by armed groups , by armed robbery , and other common crime and , most seriously , by the laying of mines , including new types of mines , and deeply concerned also at the resulting lack of safety and security for the local populations , for the refugees and displaced persons returning to the region and for the personnel of UNOMIG and of the CIS peacekeeping force ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing unstable and tense security conditions in the Gali region , characterized by acts of violence by armed groups , by armed robbery , and other common crime and , most seriously , by the laying of mines , including new types of mines , and deeply concerned also at the resulting lack of safety and security for the local populations , for the refugees and displaced persons returning to the region and for the personnel of UNOMIG and of the CIS peacekeeping force ,  
In this connection , the Special Representative and the troika stressed once again that it was imperative that UNITA provide credible data concerning the numbers and locations of armed elements under its control , and expressed their grave concern at the inaction of UNITA in fulfilling the demands contained in Security Council resolution 1118 ( 1997 ) and the presidential statement of 23 July .  
The operation in Albania was a unique multinational intervention in the sense that the situation in the country , as grave as it was , was one of internal unrest sparked by financial crisis , not the usual kind of armed conflict between opposing sides which the Security Council most often deals with .  
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
Accordingly , Israel is unable , at this juncture , to commit itself to a total ban on the use of anti _ personnel landmines until effective alternative measures are available to ensure the protection of civilians threatened on a daily basis by terrorists , and to ensure the protection of Israeli defence forces operating in areas of armed conflict .  
In a separate and dissenting opinion concerning the applicability of article 2 of the statute and the grave breaches regime , the Presiding Judge concluded that at all times relevant to the indictment , the armed conflict in the op \ x { eaa1 } ina of Prijedor was international in character , that the victims were protected persons and that article 2 was applicable .  
The campaign to promote awareness of human rights and humanitarian principles was also worth mentioning for , unless discipline was maintained among the armed forces and unless universal ethical principles were upheld , protection of victims could never be established on a solid basis . 
These populations , sometimes held hostage by armed groups bent on genocide for which an international criminal court has been set up have in turn been massacred in circumstances that need to be brought to light so that a different future can be forged .  
Whereas during the armed rebellion and aggression against Croatia many criminal acts , grave breaches of international humanitarian law and of the basic rights of the individual were committed ,  
Reiterating that many citizens who took part in the armed rebellion against the Republic of Croatia have sought and been granted Croatian documents , and that they have by this act accepted all the rights and obligations that derive from Croatian citizenship , including respect for and defence of the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Croatia , and that they have accepted the Republic of Croatia as their homeland and have expressed the wish to be included in its political , economic and social life , and in that way to contribute to its prosperity ,  
These include ethnic conflicts and disputes arising out of the neglect of the rights of persons belonging to national minorities ; border disputes that could lead to armed conflicts ; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems ; international terrorism ; organized crime and illegal trafficking in arms and drugs ; money-laundering , contraband and clandestine migration ; and transnational environmental degradation .  
The strengthening of security in the region calls for a comprehensive approach that includes parallel steps to settle conflict situations and eliminate hotbeds of tension , reduce the level of armed presence , strengthen confidence among the Mediterranean States themselves and their mutual understanding with other members of the international community , and develop economic cooperation in the region and with third countries .  
Pursuant to the peace agreements , priorities have been set and various projects formulated with the aim of : ( a ) achieving the economic and social reintegration of former combatants and demobilized members of the armed forces ; ( b ) attending to the economic and social needs of the communities most affected by the conflict and improving the living conditions of the poorest groups ; ( c ) consolidating democratic institutions ; and ( d ) promoting legal and constitutional reform .  
Instead , it had institutionalized the peaceful settlement of disputes through the establishment of a Permanent Court of Arbitration and , in case of armed conflict , had imposed certain limits and duties on the parties at war , down to the level of the individual , in the first genuine attempt by the international community to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing owing to a number of complex factors which include armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources and environmental degradation .  
The Assembly welcomed the proposed measures outlined by the Government of Cambodia in its comments5 on the report of the Special Representative , to ensure that the forthcoming communal and national elections were free and fair , that members of the armed forces remained neutral during the election campaign , that the individual vote was confidential and that local and international observers were welcomed .  
In conclusion , the Special Representative urges the Government to complete its election preparations by agreeing on an appropriate legal framework , establishing an election commission that is clearly independent , taking legal and political steps to establish the Constitutional Council , creating guarantees that would give the political parties equal opportunities to express themselves via the media , demobilizing and disarming the armed troops of political parties , and ensuring political neutrality by all military and security forces .  
There was a general atmosphere of insecurity , in which the population suffered from the arbitrariness and brazen arrogance of the Zairian armed forces ; an inefficient judiciary ; severe repression of freedom of expression and opinion , although within the margin of freedom tolerated since the National Sovereign Conference ; systematic torture and deplorable prison conditions ; and the absence of measures to ensure economic , social and cultural rights .  
If , by a democratic regime , we mean one in which human rights are respected , power is vested in the Government by the people through free elections , there is a separation of powers , the law is enforced by the authorities , there is equality under the law , the armed forces and police are at the service of everyone , the courts perform their functions independently , political parties express themselves freely , and there is freedom of the press , then this report shows that none of these conditions are being met .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability , and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Human rights monitoring has a developed expertise regarding violations committed in a context of political conflict and repression but relative security ; it is not intended to monitor violations of international humanitarian standards in the course of full-scale armed conflict .  
The special difficulties involved in investigating violations of human rights and humanitarian law in circumstances of internal armed conflict and the prevailing limitations in this respect in Rwanda should be explicitly recognized in the reports of the Field Operation .  
Genocide can be committed irrespective of any armed conflict and comprises certain crimes ( such as killing or causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of a particular group ) committed with the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group , as such .  
First , humanitarian law had a more limited objective than did human rights law , since it was applicable solely in situations of armed conflict and , without seeking to improve society , sought to protect the life , dignity and physical integrity of the individual against violence and arbitrary behaviour .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability , and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Recalling its previous relevant resolutions , as well as those of the Commission on Human Rights , in particular Commission resolution 1997 / 75 of 18 April 1997 , and the conclusions of the World Conference on Human Rights , [ 1 ] which recognized that gross violations of human rights , including in armed conflicts , are among the multiple and complex factors leading to displacement of people ,  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , particularly those of developing countries ,  
Calls upon all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in countries where humanitarian personnel are operating , in conformity with the relevant provisions of international law and national laws , to cooperate fully with the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies and organizations and to ensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel in order to allow them to perform efficiently their task of assisting the affected civilian population , including refugees and internally displaced persons ;  
Recognizing that the reintegration of former combatants and demobilized members of the armed forces continues to be one of the most complex aspects of the social and economic commitments and that the sustainability of any such programme is linked to broader challenges , such as poverty relief , employment generation , social integration , public security and efficient , transparent and speedy administration of justice ,  
Experience has shown that the United Nations has long placed special emphasis on the implementation of discretionary measures ( negotiations , retortion , provisional measures under Article 40 of the Charter of the United Nations , non-binding sanctions imposed in accordance with General Assembly resolutions and implemented individually or collectively by States , and so on ) and only in exceptional cases resorted to the use of mandatory sanctions and other enforcement measures not involving the use of armed force .  
The same gang of ultraconservatives and gangsters is responsible for the acquittal of hijackers and impedes the use of the term terrorists , while with a silent and mysterious complicity they are bolstered , funded , organized , armed , trained and assigned to intelligence missions .  
During those discussions we explained that the solution to the Kurdish problem inside Turkey could not be achieved by committing armed aggression against Iraq , or by interfering in its internal affairs , in collaboration with foreign Powers the United States and Britain but rather by fully observing the principle of mutual respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the two countries and by cooperation between their Governments to ensure security and stability on both sides of the international border .  
Similarly , we note in the report the entry into force of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) Convention and of the efforts to improve existing international conventions for the protection of world cultural properties and agree that our central goal should be increasing the number of ratifications and providing technical assistance to States with acute problems of illicit trafficking in archaeological objects , as well as aiding countries experiencing armed conflicts .  
The Rwanda Tribunal is faced with the very difficult task of adjudicating persons responsible for the most egregious crimes imaginable by the human mind : the crime of genocide , crimes against humanity and serious violations of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
In the 14 years since we began consideration of this subject , profound changes have occurred in the region , particularly since the signing on 7 August 1987 of the Esquipulas II Agreements , which established the frame of reference for the processes of national dialogue and negotiation that were required to end the armed conflicts and regional tensions by peaceful means . 
Subsequent developments have continued to be positive , and in 1997 we are witnessing for the first time in many years a Central America free of armed conflict , with legitimate Governments chosen through the free expression of popular will in transparent and pluralistic elections , thus strengthening democratic institutions and , as result , the rule of law . 
Accordingly , Israel is unable at this juncture to commit itself to a total ban on the use of anti-personnel landmines until effective alternative measures are available to ensure the protection of civilians threatened on a daily basis by terrorists and of Israeli Defence Forces operating in areas of armed conflict .  
My delegation wishes to support the proposals put forward in this regard by the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at the last substantive session of the Disarmament Commission , which called for the special session to have a wide-ranging agenda highlighting the following : review and evaluation of the current international situation ; nuclear disarmament at the global and regional levels ; elimination of other weapons of mass destruction ; effective reduction of arms and armed forces ; the relationship between disarmament and development ; and confidence-building .  
Regrettably , the continuing military occupation by Israeli forces of large areas of Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the presence of a large number of armed settlers in the occupied territories , the frequent roadblocks and boundary closures and the serious damage caused to the Palestinian economy all of them unilateral measures have a negative impact on the search for a just and peaceful settlement that respects the legitimate rights and claims of all the parties .  
All conferences stressed that every child has the right to be nurtured and protected by its family and that families and society must work together to improve the situation and protect the rights of all children , particularly those in especially difficult circumstances , for example children in areas of armed conflict , children who lack adequate family support , urban street children , abandoned children , children with disabilities , children addicted to narcotic drugs , and the girl child .  
For instance , the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions has continued to receive information about massive displacements of populations which have occurred mainly in the context of armed conflicts , including indiscriminate military attacks against civilians during counter-insurgency operations , attacks by irregular armed groups , and communal violence .  
The Government of Iraq noted its cooperation with States and international organizations and its solidarity with the endeavours of the United Nations and the humanitarian organizations , particularly in the field of human rights , with a view to establishing an early _ warning system to avoid the problem of mass exodus or to address it when it was brought about by causes such as natural disasters or regional or international armed conflicts forcing the population of a State to enter neighbouring States .  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
In this connection , the Mission underscored the importance of excluding from the extinction of liability those human rights violations which had occurred outside the strict framework of the internal armed conflict , and the major responsibility of the judicial authorities for complying with the spirit of the law by disallowing an extinction of criminal liability for those crimes which , under domestic law or the international treaties ratified by Guatemala , are imprescriptible or are not subject to such an extinction .  
As of January 1997 , it became a constant feature of government policy to declare war and a general mobilization against its domestic and external enemies , without making a distinction between those Sudanese citizens who join the armed forces fighting against the Government which are assumed or are known actively to oppose the Government of the Sudan and those who happen to be in the conflict areas , once again regardless of their race , religion , language , ethnic or social origin and status .  
If applicable , assists the Director in preparing methods and procedures for verification of human rights during internal armed confrontation , commitment to strengthening the system for the protection of human rights , commitment relating to security forces and the bearing of arms , military conscription and voluntary nature and behaviour of paramilitary forces ; assists also in following up the verification and evaluating the findings of regional offices . 
Numerous testimonies received by the Special Rapporteur indicate that the civilian population living in or near the combat zone is the most susceptible to being forced to move : in these grey zones ( zones controlled or influenced by the insurgents ) the armed forces often resort to ground searches , destruction and burning of houses , and confiscation of property and food , which lead the people to move temporarily or permanently .  
The Special Rapporteur also observes that article 17 of Protocol II Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 requires that , in the case of displacements carried out for the safety of civilians or for imperative military reasons , the responsible party must take all possible measures . . . in order that the civilian population may be received under satisfactory conditions of shelter , hygiene , health , safety and nutrition .  Article 14 of the same instrument also stipulates a prohibition of starvation of civilians under the control of organized armed forces .  
Furthermore , arms sales are also a blatant violation of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts , and is obliged to avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region or otherwise contribute to regional instability .  
With regard to the military observers , their presence in Angola during the coming months will continue to be required for the verification of the implementation of the remaining tasks of the Lusaka Protocol , the monitoring of the formation of the unified army and the demobilization of excess UNITA and FAA soldiers , as well as verification and investigation of allegations concerning the residual presence of UNITA armed elements and the existence of weapons caches .  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Bearing in mind also the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards revitalizing the economy , and stressing that a cessation of armed hostilities between the warring parties in Afghanistan and political stability are indispensable if reconstruction measures are to have a lasting effect ,  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of inadequate social and economic conditions , poverty , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , racism and all forms of intolerance , unemployment , rural-to-urban migration , illiteracy , hunger , disability and drug abuse , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Welcomes the report of the expert of the Secretary-General on the impact of armed conflict on children , [ 10 ] and takes note with appreciation of the recommendations included therein which address the prevention of the involvement of children in armed conflict , the reinforcement of preventive measures , the relevance and adequacy of existing standards , the measures required to improve the protection of children affected by armed conflict and the actions needed to promote the physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration of children affected by armed conflict ;  
Based on his experience , the Special Rapporteur has maintained that armed conflicts , terrorism , arms trafficking , covert operations relating to the interest of a third party acting to harm one or more parties to an armed conflict and violence linked to extremist intolerance foster or create the market for mercenaries , defined as foreign experts whose skilled services are sought because of their proven experience in producing destructive and deadly effective violence . 
Despite the condemnations contained in the resolutions of several United Nations bodies , Governments whose power is illegitimate , armed insurgent groups and Powers acting through covert operations have been responsible for the existence of mercenary activities , with a heavy toll on the peoples whose lives they affect .  
What this report does want to draw attention to are the dangerous grey areas and the limits which need legal safeguards in order to prohibit such advisory services from becoming active armed participation in internal conflicts or in matters of the internal security of citizens that are connected with the exercise of the rights and political freedoms provided for in international human rights instruments .  
Extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law are highlighted by the resolutions of United Nations organs as being major obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
In the light of the judicial nature of the International Tribunal , it is clear that any such determination would not affect ongoing legal proceedings or the obligation to surrender persons accused of having committed serious violations of international humanitarian law while the armed conflict was still ongoing .  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
It would be preferable to support the viewpoint that the prohibited participation by children in military operations should not be designated as direct participation since the actual practice in armed conflicts hardly allows any conclusions to be derived from the proposed distinction between direct and indirect participation by children in the conflict .  
Therefore , the members of such groups should either be covered by the conditions applicable to popular armed resistance groups , thereby subjecting them to the provisions and obligations of international humanitarian law to a certain extent , or should be regarded as groups that fail to meet the international requirements for classification as legal combatants , either as members of a regular army or a legitimate resistance movement , in which case , being totally beyond the pale of the law , there would be no point in placing them under any obligation . 
Furthermore , the recruitment of children into the armed forces of States or by non _ governmental armed groups deprives them of a normal education and their protective family environment ; this has a direct impact on their development and is at variance with the provisions of article 27 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child , which states that States parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child 's physical , mental , spiritual , model and social development . 
The present document is an analytical summary of the main points to which ICRC attaches special importance and which it has endeavoured to address in recent years , namely , minimum age of recruitment , minimum age of participation in hostilities , the notions of direct and indirect participation , the notions of armed conflict and hostilities , compulsory recruitment and voluntary enlistment , and armed groups .  
However , this criterion must be linked with the preceding one , since such control must be sufficient to enable the armed group or dissident forces to conduct sustained and concerted military operations and to implement the Protocol .  
On the other hand , it should be understood that such operations must not be sporadic and that they are planned or prepared by organized armed groups capable of taking concerted action .  
FITDH urges the working group on a draft optional protocol to fix the minimum age for recruitment into armed forces at 18 in respect of compulsory service as well as voluntary enlistment , since in many cases a minor 's decision to enlist in the armed forces is anything but free , being dictated by various circumstances , such as poverty , coercion , insecurity , a broken home or lack of alternatives , and parental consent is not enough of a guarantee .  
It was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriot people and the bi-communal order that led to division on the island when the Turkish Cypriot people were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legitimate Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
The delegation of Cyprus had given an accurate and alarming picture of the situation prevailing in the Turkish occupied area of northern Cyprus , where the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the Greek Cypriot population were being systematically violated , as they had been throughout the 23-year presence of the Turkish armed forces on the island .  
Recognizing that the reintegration of former combatants and demobilized members of the armed forces continues to be one of the most complex aspects of the social and economic commitments , and that the sustainability of any such programme is linked to broader challenges , such as poverty relief , generation of employment , social integration , public security and efficient , transparent and speedy administration of justice ,  
In 1996 , a number of African countries encountered special development situations with the collapse of public and social services , disruption of economic activities , insecurity and armed conflict , the breakdown of law and order , massive population displacement and widespread human suffering .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , economic and sexual exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance and disability , and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Appeals to all Governments to ensure that all persons deprived of their liberty are treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person and that conditions in places of detention conform to the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and , where applicable , in the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the 1977 Protocols thereto in relation to the treatment of prisoners in armed conflicts , and other pertinent international instruments ;  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
Strongly urges all the Afghan parties to work and cooperate fully with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the establishment of a democratic government elected through free and fair elections , to be held throughout the country and based on the right to self _ determination of the people of Afghanistan ;

On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 26 May 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , giving details of the aerial violations that have accompanied the fresh incursions into Iraq 's territory by the Turkish armed forces and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and to halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 31 May 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , giving details of the aerial violations that have accompanied the fresh incursions into Iraq 's territory by the Turkish armed forces and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and to halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
The Committee also notes the major problems experienced as a consequence of the armed conflict , which has imposed serious hardships on the entire population , including heavy casualties , long _ lasting physical , emotional and psychological effects , and the disruption of some basic services .  
The number of refugees and displaced persons has been rapidly increasing due to a number of complex factors which include , inter alia , armed conflicts , human rights violations , political instability , absolute poverty , social disintegration , lack of resources , and environmental degradation .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 12 June 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , giving details of the aerial violations that have accompanied the continuing incursion into Iraq 's territory by the Turkish armed forces and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and to halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
Particular problems persisted for Turkey 's rural women in eastern and southeastern Anatolia , who continued to live in traditional social frameworks and were affected by an ongoing armed conflict and whose access to opportunities and services remained severely limited .  
With the advance of the Allied Democratic Forces for the Liberation of the Congo ( ADFL ) in eastern Zaire and the consequent elimination of rear bases of armed Hutu rebels close to the Burundi-Zaire border , the security situation in Burundi gradually improved during the first months of 1997 , though strong pockets of rebels remained within the former Zaire ( now the Democratic Republic of the Congo ) near Fizi , Kalemie and Moba - enabling them to launch operations against targets in Burundi , including the Government 's military strongholds of Bururi and Makamba provinces .  
John Deutch , former Director of Central Intelligence , confirmed to Peter Jennings that the intelligence operative who was in charge of organizing the armed attack in March 1995 informed his superiors about the schemes which he was preparing and implementing in the north of Iraq , as well as about the CIA payment of $ 6 million to former Iraqi army officers for supporting this base operation and the secret introduction into Iraq of highly sophisticated transmission equipment making direct communication with the CIA possible . 
Deeply concerned by the numerous reports from a large number of reliable sources attesting that , regardless of human dignity , armed groups of religious extremists , who act in flagrant violation of the principles of tolerance of Islam , are terrorising civilian populations in order to force them to support their cause , by resorting , inter alia , to summary executions , the cruelty of which adds futile suffering to the fate of innocent victims of decapitation or throat cutting , including old people , women and children ,  
Deeply concerned at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women , and that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to acts of discrimination , violence and abuse based on gender , including women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant workers , women living in rural communities , women living in poverty , women with disabilities , elderly women , women in situations of armed conflict and girl children ,  
Affirming that all violations of the human rights of women in situations of armed conflict , including in particular murder , systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , are flagrant violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ,  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
Some of the most intractable armed conflicts being dealt with by the United Nations are those in which a recurring cycle of violence , an erosion of political legitimacy and a loss of economic viability have deprived a State of its authority to cope either with the causes or the consequences of the excessive accumulation , proliferation and use of small arms and light weapons .  
Deeply concerned at the recurrence of armed conflicts exacerbated by the illicit transfer of arms , their incidence on the enjoyment of human rights and on the application of international humanitarian law , as well as by their adverse consequences for international and regional peace and security ,  
These include international solidarity and burden-sharing ; effective measures to ensure that refugees are admitted , identified and separated from armed elements ; locating camps at a safe distance from borders ; and ensuring rapid and secure access by UNHCR and other relevant humanitarian organizations to persons of concern . 
Furthermore , arms sales to south Cyprus also constitute a violation of the 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider " the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts " and are obliged to " avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region , or otherwise contribute to regional instability " .  
The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , adopted on 15 September 1995 by the Fourth World Conference on Women , held at Beijing from 4 to 15 September 1995 , refers to coercive economic measures in a section on strategic objectives and actions concerning women and armed conflict . 11 Under strategic objective E . 3 , paragraph 145 contains , inter alia , the following provisions regarding actions to be taken by Governments and international and regional organizations : 
The threats posed by weapons of mass destruction are far from being extinguished , and the consequences of miscalculation or deliberate acts can be horrific , as we know from the terrorist activities of a cult group armed with nerve gas in Japan , biological and toxin weapons in Iraq and persistent reports and risks of nuclear smuggling .  
Their ultimate sacrifice reminds us that human beings are capable of great altruism in the face of suffering and of calm when faced with the destructive passion of armed conflict , even at the risk of their own lives .  
It seems illogical , and indeed morally indefensible , to suggest that armed forces are free to engage in behaviour against citizens of their own country which would be outlawed were they involved in military operations abroad .  
The International Committee was currently developing a model manual for use by armed forces , which would serve as a reference tool for military commanders to incorporate the norms of humanitarian law into the operational decision-making process .  
Belgium accepted only a minimum age of 18 for ( a ) direct or indirect involvement in hostilities ; ( b ) voluntary or involuntary recruitment both by the armed forces and by non _ governmental armed groups .  
During the 1980s , the region experienced its longest period of elected Governments and constitutional processes , reduced military spending , and the acceptance by the armed forces of civilian governmental authority .  
Gravely concerned that the continuation of armed conflicts in the continent threatens regional peace , causes massive human displacement , suffering and poverty , perpetuates instability and diverts scarce resources from long-term development ,  
Gravely concerned that the continuation of armed conflicts in the continent threatens regional peace , causes massive human displacement , suffering and poverty , perpetuates instability and diverts scarce resources from long-term development ,  
For non _ international armed conflicts , the elements of the offence are only met when the combined violations of penal provisions rise to the level of denying indispensable judicial guarantees recognized by all civilized peoples .  
From 1963 , the Turkish Cypriots have been forced to live in scattered enclaves across the island under deplorable conditions , faced with harsh economic restrictions and besieged by hostile Greek Cypriot armed elements .  
His delegation was also deeply concerned about the illegal arms trade carried on by organized criminal groups , which increased the likelihood of international and internal armed conflict and resulted in the destruction of national structures and cultures .  
In its advisory opinion , the Court ruled that the threat or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the international law applicable to armed conflict and , in particular , the principles and rules of humanitarian law .  
The existence of many internal armed conflicts , some of them attributable to ethnic mistrust and resistance , which extend to the regional level and in which the warring parties resort to the hiring of mercenaries to boost their military potential ;  
It recommends that the State party raise the legal minimum age of voluntary enlistment into the armed forces in the light of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
They included , for example , poverty , gender discrimination and the difficulties faced by children in need of special protection , whether institutionalized , living in the streets , involved in armed conflicts or substance abuse , exploited and abused , etc .  
Both parties to the armed conflict have disregarded the rules of international humanitarian law , particularly the rebels , who display unusual cruelty which is reminiscent of the massacres committed during the so _ called war of liberation against the Hutu refugees and which the Special Rapporteur , the joint mission of the Commission on Human Rights and the Secretary _ General 's Investigative Team were prevented from investigating .  
. . .  This destructive process has been hastened by the close links that have been established among the armed groups , the armies of losers , which proliferate throughout central Africa , and of which the former Rwandan government forces are the most violent , well armed , well organized and dangerous ( para .  91 ) .  
In an era when ethnic conflict and civil war have become increasingly common in comparison to international armed conflicts , the responsibility of a new Government to pay for past violations may require a specific guiding principle , which should be incorporated in the guidelines .  
Urges States to uphold the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and settlements , inter alia , through effective measures to prevent the infiltration of armed elements , to identify and separate any such armed elements from refugee populations , to settle refugees in secure locations and to afford to the Office of the High Commissioner and other appropriate humanitarian organizations prompt , unhindered and safe access to asylum-seekers , refugees and other persons of concern ;  
As the independent expert pointed out in her two previous reports , as long as the warlords , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their fight in Somalia , and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law relating to non _ international armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia , irrespective of whether a specific area is engulfed in active fighting or not .  
The optional protocol aims to strengthen the existing international standard contained in article 38 of the Convention by raising the minimum age limits for recruitment into armed forces and participation in armed conflict .  
As we know full well , current armed conflicts almost always reflect historical accumulations of unsatisfied demands , in most cases aggravated by inadequate social and economic situations and by international political and economic conditions .  
At the normative level , it is important to emphasize that , despite the specific nature of today 's armed conflicts , the international community seems to have at its disposal a sufficient arsenal of legal instruments to protect civilian populations .  
There is a common thread running through the preceding statements that makes unequivocally clear one of the characteristics of the recent armed conflicts that have led to political or military action by this Organization : the fact that their first and principal target has been the civilian population , in particular its most vulnerable sectors children , women , the elderly , the sick , refugees and internally displaced persons .  
Canada has always distinguished itself by an honourable , consistent and outstanding involvement in United Nations efforts to achieve international peace and security , in particular by its humanitarian devotion to alleviating the suffering of civilian populations in armed conflicts .  
The second level is a complex one that involves a specific mechanism consisting of various interrelated elements , ranging from the body of international humanitarian norms and provisions to the agencies authorized to ensure the rights of the civilian population in situations of armed conflict and to provide humanitarian assistance for them , and so on . 
The main method , if it can be put that way , of conducting so-called combat operations during contemporary armed conflicts is ethnic cleansing , whereby a part of the territory of a sovereign State is cleansed of its local population , who , in turn , become displaced persons and virtual refugees on their own soil . 
The real test of States as to the seriousness they attach to international humanitarian law comes when they face clear and immediate threats to their national security and nonetheless demonstrate a decisive determination to educate their armed forces , to incorporate their legal processes and to retain transparency in order to protect the rights of civilians in armed conflict .  
Urges all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , to ensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel in conformity with the relevant provisions of international law and national laws , so as to allow them to perform efficiently their task of assisting children ;  
In many countries currently engulfed by war and internal conflict , adjustment-induced social unrest provided the initial impetus for ethnic , tribal , religious fundamentalist and nationalist frenzy which eventually led to armed conflict . 
Meanwhile , we must let the rest of the world understand the real nature of this conflict - that this is not just another internal conflict in some small and distant developing country , but an armed rebellion , externally inspired and maintained , against the people of Sierra Leone and their democratically elected Government .  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the increasingly ethnic and religious nature of the conflict , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
In the light of the provisions and principles of the Convention , especially the principles of the best interests of the child ( art . 3 ) and the right to life , survival and development ( art . 6 ) , the Committee expressed its deep concern at the early legal minimum age of voluntary enlistment into the armed forces and recommended that the State party raise the age in the light of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
The countries of the region , aware that poverty prevented many children in developing countries from exercising their right to education and development , had set themselves priorities in the areas of education , health , food and nutrition and specific targets for children and adolescents in need of special care , such as children who worked or engaged in marginal activities , street children and children who were disabled , abused , orphans or victims of armed conflicts .  
The deterioration of the human rights situation is the result of the worsening of the armed conflict and the failure by the Government to implement effective legislative , administrative and other measures , such as those intended to combat paramilitary activity and impunity or to protect human rights advocates .  
They expressed their grave concern at the renewed outbreak of hostilities in the Congo following the perpetration of acts of destabilization by armed groups , causing huge losses of life and material damage and hindering the implementation of commitments undertaken by the authorities to take measures to promote national reconciliation , rebuild the country and relaunch the democratic process .  
They recognized that unusual and massive movements of populations , particularly in the aftermath of armed conflict in certain countries of the subregion , constituted a grave threat to domestic peace , and urged each Government to manage migratory flows more effectively and efficiently and to better control their borders .  
Thirdly , the provisions of article 4 , especially those exempting from the scope of the draft convention activities of armed forces [ of a State ] during an armed conflict , were used to sustain a questionable exception which had the effect of recognizing an alleged right of such forces to use and traffic in nuclear or radioactive material , on the pretext of the exercise of official duties and inasmuch as [ such activities ] are governed by ( . . . ) international law .  
Articles 212 and 213 of the Constitution stipulate that the armed forces are obedient , professional and non-political , and shall not deliberate in matters of service , and that their structure , legal regime , doctrine , composition and functioning are defined by the law , regulations and special provisions which the President of the Republic may adopt .  
Therefore , international efforts to bridge the gap between developing and developed countries should be intensified through the implementation of an information strategy on aspects of globalization relating to social justice and the understanding among peoples that strengthened assistance to developing countries , vulnerable population groups and the victims of armed conflicts , human rights violations and natural disasters . 
The overall situation at the end of 1998 was characterized by continuing armed conflict , the political crisis resulting from lack of agreement on the framework for durable peace , the continuing violations and denial of human rights and the deteriorating humanitarian situation , affected by the absence of international personnel of the United Nations agencies as well as others engaged in humanitarian work , and the reduction of resource flows .  
The main topics discussed by the working group during the general discussion on questions relating to the draft optional protocol included the minimum age for participation in hostilities , the issue of direct or indirect involvement in hostilities , the age of recruitment , be it voluntary or compulsory , into armed forces , and the possibility of including a clause to prevent child recruitment by non-governmental armed groups .  
Second , it was important to understand that , in addition to international instruments , the value systems of individual societies represented another basic means of protecting children in armed conflicts , since one of the main objectives of any society had always been the protection of children , who were its most vulnerable members .  
It should be borne in mind that the current situation of millions of children in many parts of the world remained critical as a result of poor economic and social conditions , poverty , armed conflicts , the exploitation of child labour and the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography , and that the number of children infected with HIV / AIDS had risen at an alarming rate .  
In a country torn by an internal armed conflict to which international humanitarian law is applicable , an official is dismissed .  
When the Democratic Republic of the Congo 's painful transition to independence in the 1960s saw the birth of the first armed militias , political leaders , including those in the United Nations , did not gauge what the refugee problem would become 40 years later , with refugee camps transformed into military training and arms-supply facilities , compromising any good-faith attempt to provide humanitarian assistance to vulnerable affected populations .  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
To enact and , where necessary , reinforce or amend penal , civil , labour and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of violence , whether in the home , the workplace , the community or society , in custody or in situations of armed conflict , and to ensure that they conform with relevant international human rights instruments and humanitarian law ;  
That the rights of the child as laid out in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law are at their most pertinent in time of armed conflict , expresses grave concern at the numerous damaging effects of armed conflicts on children and emphasizes the need for the world community to focus increased attention on this serious problem with a view to alleviating those effects ;  
The induction of lightly armed international civilian security officers and additional local watchmen has further augmented the existing internal security arrangements .  
Protocol I additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions , relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts , article 35 , paragraph 3 : " It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended , or may be expected , to cause widespread , long-term and severe damage to the natural environment " .  
The persisting armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering , forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
Refrain from any interference , direct or indirect , individual or collective , in internal and external affairs falling within the national competence of individual States , regardless of their mutual relations , and that they shall refrain from any form of armed intervention or threat with armed intervention against another member State , as well as from undertaking political economic or other coercion ;  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
To enact and , where necessary , reinforce or amend penal , civil , labour and administrative sanctions in domestic legislation to punish and redress the wrongs done to women and girls subjected to any form of violence , whether in the home , the workplace , the community or society , in custody or in situations of armed conflict , and to ensure that they conform with relevant international human rights instruments and humanitarian law ;  
Protocol I additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions , relating to the protection of victims of international armed conflicts , article 35 , paragraph 3 : It is prohibited to employ methods or means of warfare which are intended , or may be expected , to cause widespread , long-term and severe damage to the natural environment .  * E / 1999 / 100 .  
That the rights of the child as laid out in international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law are at their most pertinent in time of armed conflict , expresses grave concern at the numerous damaging effects of armed conflicts on children and emphasizes the need for the world community to focus increased attention on this serious problem with a view to alleviating those effects ;  
The Commission welcomes the reduction in the number of human rights violations attributed to the armed and security forces and the police , but is concerned that the armed forces have not fulfilled their intention to suspend from active service all those in their ranks who are under formal juridical or disciplinary investigation for human rights violations until guilt or innocence is determined and to dismiss them where such allegations have been proven .  
Women with mental disabilities are particularly vulnerable , while there is limited understanding , in general , of the broad range of risks to mental health to which women are disproportionately susceptible as a result of gender discrimination , violence , poverty , armed conflict , dislocation and other forms of social deprivation . 
The general human rights climate has also been worsened by the accompanying wave of protests and demonstrations , some of them violent and destructive of private property , and by the heightened sense of insecurity springing from an increase in threats and acts of intimidation , and by the spates of armed crime , acts of violence and assassinations or attempted assassinations , some of them possibly politically motivated .  
In that context , it continued to be concerned about the damaging effects of armed conflict on Afghan children , who were the victims of incessant hostilities and abhorrent treatment by the Taliban on ethnic and religious grounds .  
The need for humanitarian responses to address the special reproductive health needs of girls and women , including those arising from pregnancy as a result of rape , sexual mutilation , childbirth at an early age or infection with sexually transmitted diseases was emphasized and gender-sensitized education programmes for armed forces and civilian police were called for .  Specific dangers faced by girls in conjunction with child labour were highlighted .  
While noting some signs of greater political freedom in East Timor , these sources reported that East Timorese continued to be persecuted , arbitrarily arrested or routinely harassed for the peaceful expression of their convictions or because they were suspected of supporting the armed resistance .  
A staff member , other than one recruited specifically for a mission , who has completed one year of satisfactory probationary service or who has a permanent appointment and who is called upon to serve in the armed forces of the State of which the staff member is a national , whether for training or active duty , may be granted special leave without pay for the duration of such military service , in accordance with terms and conditions set forth in appendix C to these Rules .  
While pointing out that peace was a prerequisite for development , a number of delegations stated that , in recent years , armed conflict had exacted and was continuing to exact a heavy toll on human settlements and human settlements development and several called on the Centre to provide reconstruction assistance to countries and regions afflicted by armed conflict and natural and man-made disasters .  
This includes regular army and naval forces , armed civilian groups , associated paramilitary groups , air forces , national guards , border police , army reserves , military police , intelligence services , federal and Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs local , special , riot and anti-terrorist police , and any other groups or individuals so designated by the international security force ( KFOR ) commander ;  
These included the bringing of armed civilian groups under strict control and the prompt arrest and prosecution of those who incited or threatened to use violence , a ban on rallies by armed groups , the redeployment of Indonesian military forces , the immediate institution of a process of laying down of arms by all armed groups to be completed well in advance of the holding of the ballot and the freedom of association and expression of all political forces and tendencies .  
Despite an increasing awareness of the problem , however , many refugees were once again exposed to cross-border attacks , forced recruitment into armed fighting forces and confinement in remote , isolated and perilously located camps .  
Mechanisms were also to foster national reconciliation , such as the Truth Commission , whose mandate was to shed light on the most relevant cases of human rights violations , the ad hoc committee responsible for purging the armed forces and the Peace Commission ( COPAZ ) , which was responsible for safeguarding and ensuring compliance with commitments undertaken to promote assistance and community development , mainly in the agricultural sector .  
Paragraph 1 does not apply to international obligations which are expressed or intended to be obligations of total restraint even for States engaged in armed conflict or acting in self-defence , and in particular to obligations of a humanitarian character relating to the protection of the human person in time of armed conflict or national emergency . 
Owing to the uncontrolled crossing-over of armed groups of Albanian terrorists and bandits , systematically abusing , intimidating , abducting and killing non-Albanian populations and looting , stealing and destroying their property , as well as making forced entries into people 's homes , burning churches and places of worship , there followed a massive exodus of Serbs and Montenegrins from Kosovo and Metohija .  
Firmly announces that all foreign military recruits to be captured by the armed forces of the Islamic State of Afghanistan will be considered as criminals and would be directed to the security authorities of the State for prosecution and punishment in accordance with Afghanistan 's criminal code of 1976 , which prescribes severe punishment against those who are committing crimes against the internal and external security of the State ;  
The Security Council 's increased concern for the plight of civilians in armed conflict has been reinforced by the frequent briefings it has received on the humanitarian situation in countries affected by conflict , and is further illustrated by the establishment by the Council of international ad hoc criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda . 
The combined effects of this and of ongoing armed conflicts and several devastating natural calamities had a disproportionate effect on the most disadvantaged groups of society , also contributing to increased feminization of poverty .  
Such personnel , installations , material , units or vehicles were entitled to that protection given to civilians or civilian objects under the international law of armed conflict and the accused was aware of the factual circumstances that established that protection .  
UNICEF has also widely disseminated a conceptual framework on UNICEFs human rights approach , a discussion paper on indicators for global monitoring of child rights , a paper on human rights for children and women , a series of animated child rights cartoons , and will release throughout 1999 a series of working papers compiling the relevant international standards in relation to children in armed conflict , girls , child labour and sexual exploitation .  
UNICEF has actively publicized its view that it is unacceptable that a clear ban on childrens recruitment has not yet been imposed on the direct and indirect participation in hostilities of children below 18 years of age , regardless of whether they have been forced to join armed forces , or whether they appear to have done so voluntarily ; this applies equally to governmental and non-governmental forces .  
Such action is needed in order to enhance international and regional security ; reduce the risk of armed conflict , political violence , terrorism and violent crime ; combat and suppress the illicit trafficking in small arms ; promote sustainable peace settlements and good governance ; and , above all , stop human suffering . 
" The Security Council is deeply concerned that countries involved in , emerging from , or close to protracted armed conflicts are particularly vulnerable to violence resulting from the indiscriminate use of small arms in armed conflict .  
With respect to the preliminary issues of the applicability of article 2 of the Statute of the Tribunal and the grave breaches regime laid down in the Geneva Conventions of 1949 , the Trial Chamber held that an " international armed conflict existed in Bosnia and Herzegovina " and that the victims of the alleged offences were " protected persons " within the meaning of the Geneva Conventions .  
General Blaki _ is charged with grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions , violations of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity on the basis of his alleged responsibility as a superior in respect of the serious violations of international humanitarian law committed by members of the armed forces of the HVO against Bosnian Muslims in the area of central Bosnia during the period from May 1992 to January 1994 .  
While mercenaries may be recruited , trained and financed from within solid , stable countries , they are in fact used chiefly in countries affected by political violence , internal armed conflict , insurrection or insurgency and lacking the necessary financial or technical capacity to exploit their natural resources on an industrial scale .  
Without obviating the need to clarify , refine , update and expand the rules of customary international and treaty law to combat mercenary activity , it should be established as a principle that , in essence , the aim of such rules is to condemn mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the humanitarian standards that apply to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
The persistence of mercenary activities , the range and variety of the forms in which they are carried out and the hidden networks of complicity behind them suggest that States , particularly the smallest and weakest ones , the least developed , those forming archipelagoes , those with valuable natural resources but fragile political systems and those faced with armed insurrection and internal conflicts , are not adequately protected against mercenarism in its various forms .  
It expressed concern at the grave situation created in Gabon by the massive influx of refugees from warring neighbouring countries and again appealed urgently to the United Nations , particularly the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) , and to the international community to provide assistance to Gabon with a view to meeting the varied needs of the refugees and helping the country to stem the danger posed by the entry of armed refugees into its territory .  
We are confident that with disinterested assistance by the international community the Government of Indonesia will be able to bring the situation under control through tangible efforts including control of the armed elements , maintenance of security and extension of humanitarian assistance to alleviate the suffering of the refugees and the disadvantaged civilians with the help of the International Red Cross .  
Expressing its deep concern at the erosion in respect for international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and principles during armed conflict , in particular deliberate acts of violence against all those protected under such law , and expressing also its concern at the denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need ,  
Underlining the importance of the widest possible dissemination of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and of relevant training for , inter alia , civilian police , armed forces , members of the judicial and legal professions , civil society and personnel of international and regional organizations ,  
My delegation participated in that debate , and therefore I will confine myself to repeating here that my country is convinced of the importance of raising to 18 years the minimum age for recruitment be it voluntary or mandatory , by regular armed forces or armed opposition groups and for direct or indirect participation in armed conflicts .  
That decision means that the Security Council will start to be involved in the protection of civilians in armed conflict as an implementation mechanism of the international community to enforce international humanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions , which until now , as stressed by previous speakers , have often been ignored , unsatisfactorily implemented , seriously violated and abused ; their violators have not really been brought to justice . 
It is truly regrettable that , despite quite a number of basic instruments in international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law which provide for the essential legal protection of civilians in armed conflict , the gross violations of their rights around the world have not yet ceased .  
Recognizing the critical role played by many other United Nations and non-United Nations bodies and humanitarian agencies in protecting civilians in armed conflict and in providing them with humanitarian assistance and all necessary relief , we stand by our position that the Security Council should be the guiding and coordinating organ in these international efforts .  
We also join the call to move away from double standards in the field of human rights , and we believe that the same attention should be devoted to those situations , wherever they may arise , that involve a loss of civilian life in armed conflict or which are a source of untold suffering , without allowing the political considerations of Council members , and especially of the permanent ones , to prevail over the collective considerations of the Council and of the United Nations as a whole .  
From traditional society to our modern world with its elaborate written laws , it has always been understood that persons who are not involved in combat during an armed conflict should not be subject to attack .  
Expressing its deep concern at the erosion in respect for international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and principles during armed conflict , in particular deliberate acts of violence against all those protected under such law , and expressing also its concern at the denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need ,  
Underlining the importance of the widest possible dissemination of international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and of relevant training for , inter alia , civilian police , armed forces , members of the judicial and legal professions , civil society and personnel of international and regional organizations ,  
After over three decades of an internal armed conflict marked by extreme cruelty , a conflict which was , among other things , an expression of profound and deep-rooted political and ideological intolerance , all the indications were that reintegrating the former guerrillas was going to be a complicated and dangerous process .  
The armed intervention and the decisive role played by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The Hague , brought to bear in defence of the principles of humanity and human rights , seem to foreshadow a strengthened determination on the part of the international community to enforce respect for the fundamental values of justice and human dignity that inspired the San Francisco Charter .  
Arms transfers and trafficking , and the resulting armed conflicts which they feed , are having a devastating impact on social , political and economic life for Africa south of the Sahara , a region endowed with natural resources but which still has pockets in which live the poorest people in the world today . 
The Security Council is deeply concerned that countries involved in , emerging from , or close to protracted armed conflicts are particularly vulnerable to violence resulting from the indiscriminate use of small arms in armed conflict .  
My report to the Security Council on the protection of civilians in armed conflict ( S / 1999 / 957 ) , which was considered by the Council in September , contains detailed proposals on the legal and physical protection of civilians to enhance compliance with international humanitarian law and human rights law during armed conflict .  
Everyone is aware that this trade has contributed to intensifying and prolonging armed conflicts in Africa , and to further complicating peacekeeping efforts by impeding economic and social development in certain regions of the continent .  
The tasks of the United Nations force would be to maintain a secure environment throughout the territory of East Timor , to provide direct security for United Nations personnel and property , to monitor the prompt and complete withdrawal of any remaining Indonesian military and security personnel , to take measures to disarm and demobilize armed groups and to assist humanitarian activities as appropriate , including the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons .  
Strongly condemn the exploitation of our wealth and the wicked destruction of human lives of which the country is a victim by all the foreign armed forces , above all Rwandan and Ugandan , who one day or another will leave us with a country that has been bled dry , exploited , plundered and ruined ;  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
I would like to emphasize that it was the Greek Cypriot armed onslaught in December 1963 against the Turkish Cypriots and the binational order that led to the division of the island when the Turkish Cypriots were forced to live in enclaves , deprived of all basic necessities and fundamental human rights , for 11 years prior to the legal Turkish intervention of 1974 .  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of girls and boys in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions in an increasingly globalized world economy , pandemics , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , discrimination and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Emphasizing the importance of the end of a critical period in Central American history and the start of a new phase free from armed conflict , with freely elected Governments in each country and with profound political , economic , social and other changes which have created a climate conducive to the promotion of economic growth and further progress towards the consolidation and further development of democratic , just and equitable societies ,  
Mr . Christian Tomuschat , the Commissions Coordinator , detailed its main conclusions and recommendations the fruit of a year and a half of work on the human rights violations and acts of violence which occurred during the internal armed conflict .  In its conclusions , the Commission stated that at least 83 per cent of the victims were Mayan and attributed institutional responsibility for 93 per cent of the violations to agents of the State , principally members of the army .  
An organized group of heavily armed individuals , claiming to represent local residents , broke into the offices of the Izabal Banana Workers Union , threatened union leaders that they must give up the Union and their jobs at BANDEGUA , forced them to call off the union mobilization planned for the next day and compelled them , on pain of death , to leave the area with their families .  
Condemns the widespread violations and abuses of human rights and humanitarian law , including the rights to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religion , association and movement , the forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict and , in particular , the grave human rights violations against women and girls ;  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the ground of ethnicity ;  
In the framework of the ongoing internal armed conflict , serious , gross and systematic human rights violations and large-scale breaches of international humanitarian law have forced a growing number of individuals and entire communities to leave their homes .  
Participants concluded that while the underlying causes of displacement in Colombia are multiple ( the internal armed conflict , land disputes , large-scale development projects , etc . ) , violations of human rights and humanitarian law are most often the immediate cause of displacement .  It was therefore argued that a drastic improvement in respect for human rights in Colombia would be the most effective way to prevent displacement .  
Having concluded that displacement is the result of violations of human rights and humanitarian law , workshop participants went on to discuss how internal displacement is not only the result of armed conflict but a strategy to militarily control disputed areas populated by communities perceived as supporters of the enemy .  
In Africa , in particular , children were all too often the victims of armed conflict , a situation aggravated by natural disaster , disease , an adverse economic environment and the growing burden of foreign debt , while in Palestine and other occupied territories , children were being killed , tortured and imprisoned without having committed any crime .  
The tasks of the United Nations force would be to maintain a secure environment throughout the territory of East Timor , to provide direct security for United Nations personnel and property , to monitor the prompt and complete withdrawal of any remaining Indonesian military and security personnel , to take measures to disarm and demobilize armed groups and to assist humanitarian activities as appropriate , including the safe return of refugees and internally displaced persons .  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of girls and boys in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions in an increasingly globalized world economy , pandemics , natural disasters , armed conflict , displacement , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , discrimination and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Urges States to uphold the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and settlements , inter alia , through effective measures to prevent the infiltration of armed elements , to identify and separate any such armed elements from refugee populations , to settle refugees in secure locations , and to afford to the Office of the High Commissioner and other appropriate humanitarian organizations prompt , unhindered and safe access to asylum-seekers , refugees and other persons of concern ;  
Stressing the importance of adherence to international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law in order to avert mass exoduses and to protect refugees and internally displaced persons , and expressing its deep concern at the lack of respect for those laws and principles , especially during armed conflict , including the denial of safe and unimpeded access to the displaced ,  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 2 December 1999 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , concerning a fresh act of aggression carried out by Turkish armed forces in the territory of northern Iraq on 23 November 1999 that constitutes a flagrant violation of Iraq 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and poses a grave threat to its national and regional security . 
Further to my letter dated 17 November 1999 addressed to you ( S / 1999 / 1188 , annex ) , I should like to draw your attention to the fact that on 23 November 1999 units of the Turkish armed forces consisting of two brigades supported by armoured cars and the forces maintained in the area following previous hostile operations carried out a fresh act of aggression against the territory of northern Iraq .  
Each State Party shall review its declaration ( s ) under article 2 on an annual basis , with a view to the possibility of increasing the minimum age that it applies for the voluntary enlistment of persons into its national armed forces and for the participation of such persons in armed conflict , and shall deposit any declaration ( s ) accepting higher standards when applicable .  
Condemns the widespread violations and abuses of human rights and humanitarian law , including the rights to life , liberty and security of person , freedom from torture and from other forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , freedom of opinion , expression , religion , association and movement , the forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict and , in particular , the grave human rights violations against women and girls ;  
The intensification of armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity ;  
At the impact of the current armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and continuing serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by all parties , in particular :  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the last few years , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
The delegations supporting its inclusion favoured a broad definition , as it would be conducive to the control of such trafficking , and noted that , while some of the listed devices were more likely to be used in armed conflicts or by terrorists , they were still likely to be trafficked by persons engaged in transnational organized crime .  
Article 10 of the Act states : The Regulations pursuant to this Act shall establish the grounds for complete or partial exemption from service in the armed forces , indicating the physical , moral or social impediments thereto and the manner in which they must be verified .  
According to the information received by the Special Rapporteur and the observations he has made during his various missions , mercenary activities continue to be carried on both through traditional means of recruitment and hiring and in new forms , including recruitment by private companies offering military security services , which take part in armed conflicts in specific countries by virtue of contracts signed with Governments .  
The Working Group was informed by several non-governmental organizations that members of the armed and security forces accused of having committed enforced or involuntary disappearances and other grave human rights violations in previous decades had not been brought to court .  
The Special Rapporteur , in an addendum to her report , on country situations ( E / CN . 4 / 1999 / 39 / Add . 1 ) , stated that she had received numerous allegations concerning extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions committed by armed insurgent groups in Sierra Leone .  
Such personnel , installations , material , units or vehicles were entitled to that protection given to civilians or civilian objects under the international law of armed conflict and the accused was aware of the factual circumstances that established that protection .  
Such personnel , installations , material , units or vehicles were entitled to that protection given to civilians or civilian objects under the international law of armed conflict and the accused was aware of the factual circumstances that established that protection .  
The military authorities specifically reiterated their public pledge not only to support the ongoing peace and democratic processes but also to transform the armed forces into a more professional republican army subordinate to civilian authorities following the elections .  
It is further alleged that , in contrast to the improved situation in the north of Uganda , armed clashes in the west of Uganda between the UPDF and the insurgent Allied Democratic Front ( ADF ) , which have also involved the abduction and forcible recruitment of children , have intensified since June 1997 .  
ICRC suggested that many purposes could be envisaged : a document meant to facilitate the dissemination of the relevant norms , an instrument aimed at clarifying the substance of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflict , a text aimed at clarifying the responsibility of non-State actors , or a document aimed at bridging the gap ( if one existed ) between international humanitarian law and human rights law in situations of internal violence .  
According to Turkey , the content of fundamental standards of humanity should be limited to international human rights law and not include international humanitarian law , as they concerned situations of internal violence which did not reach the threshold of an armed conflict .  
Over the last 50 years , and especially since the end of the cold war , the decrease in the number of international armed conflicts has been offset by an increase in the number of civil wars and other situations of internal violence , which are characterized by massive and systematic violations of human rights .  
Taking the opportunity offered by Articles 10 and 11 of the Charter , my delegation would also like to make all the Members of our universal Organization aware of the genuine motives behind the armed aggression that the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its peace-loving people are suffering and to ask them to contribute to the establishment of a peaceful and lasting solution to the conflict that is currently tearing my country apart .  
In response , the sponsor delegation pointed to the numerous international organizations and other bodies and entities involved in the provision of humanitarian assistance and stressed the importance of not interfering with their operational procedures and the inadmissibility of using armed force in the provision of humanitarian assistance , which might paralyse the work of international humanitarian organizations and institutions or nullify such activities .  
This policy has also included the organization and support of armed groups ; air and naval raids against our territory ; the hatching of over 600 plots to assassinate the leader of our revolution ; a military invasion by a mercenary army ; the most serious threat ever of a global nuclear conflict , in October 1962 ; and finally , a brutal commercial and financial blockade and a ferocious economic war against my country that have now lasted 40 years .  
Special mention should be made of our Bolivar 2000 plan , an initiative of the Presidency of the Republic to provide resources and professional and logistical capabilities from the armed forces to the population in order to establish an integrated social-service programme aimed , inter alia , at the provision of timely assistance to meet the peoples basic needs and at rehabilitating the social infrastructure .  
While it goes without saying that we have a legal obligation to abide by relevant international law , it is also true , regrettably , that compliance with international humanitarian law and the law of armed conflict needs to be further improved in the wake of numerous violations of such norms .  
Political , social and economic transformation now present us with a Central America free from armed conflict , a Central America with strengthened democratic institutions and a Central America in which peace , the protection of human rights and regional integration have been established on a solid footing .  
Ecuador attaches the utmost importance to the Ottawa Convention , because we are convinced that it strengthens and improves upon the principles of international humanitarian law that are applicable to armed conflict , consolidates respect for disarmament conventions , especially those relating to controls on conventional arms that have especially harmful and indiscriminate effects , and , in particular , fosters and strengthens peace .  
This year , as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions and the one hundredth anniversary of the Hague Conventions , armed conflicts in many parts of the world , including the Great Lakes region , Angola , Sierra Leone , East Timor , the Balkans and Caucasia , have given rise to frequent and flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
In effect States should undertake additional measures , such as stepping up efforts to eliminate anti-personnel mines , combating the excessive stockpiling and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons , addressing the fate of children involved in armed conflicts , protecting and assisting internally displaced people and ensuring the rapid entry into force of the Statute of the International Criminal Court .  
This year such issues include the dumping of nuclear waste and other toxic substances , the regional seas programme of the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , the increasing threat to shipping from piracy and armed robbery at sea , the importance of enhancing the safety of navigation and the continued work of the United Nations Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization towards a convention on the protection of the underwater cultural heritage .  
These included reduction of the infant mortality and under-five child mortality by one third and of maternal mortality by half , cutting down by 50 per cent the number of children under five suffering from malnutrition , enabling every child to attend primary school , immunizing 90 percent of the worlds infants and protecting children in especially difficult circumstances , particularly in situations of armed conflict .  
The armed conflicts that have for years been tearing apart the Horn of Africa and Central Africa have resulted in thousands of deaths , orphans , refugees and displaced persons in brief , an unprecedented humanitarian disaster compounded by the collapse of economic and social and , sometimes , political infrastructures .  
As we approach the end of this century , which surely will be remembered as the one in which mankind developed and used its most powerful weapon yet , the nuclear weapon , we must lay the foundation for a new collective consciousness directed towards the quest for peace and security by means other than armed confrontation , and give thought to the realities and contradictions involved in the disarmament process .  
The Committee regrets that its dialogue with representatives of the State party regarding the root causes of the armed conflict was inconclusive ; the absence in the report of statistics relating to the north and east of the country can only reinforce the view of the Committee that the question of discrimination in relation to the economic , social and cultural rights of ethnic groups remains the central issue in the armed conflict in Sri Lanka .  
The Committee is fully aware of the human and material costs of the armed conflict in Sri Lanka and the deleterious effects this has on the economic , social and cultural rights of every person living in the country .  
The advisory opinion also emphasized that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the requirements of international law applicable in armed conflict , particularly those of the principles and rules of international humanitarian law .  
In the current international context , characterized by growing interdependence and globalization , it is essential for Member States to show greater political will by intensifying dialogue and joint undertakings and strengthening international cooperation through confidence-building measures , which can reduce tension and the risk of armed confrontation between States .  
At the initiative of Burkina Faso , joint military exercises , entitled Kompienga Unity 98 , for the purpose of training personnel for peacekeeping operations was held from 16 to 21 April 1998 ; the armed forces of Benin , Burkina Faso , Cte dIvoire , Ghana , the Niger , Nigeria , Togo and Chad had taken part in the exercises , in which a great deal of attention had been given to humanitarian issues .  
While the Special Rapporteur recognizes the difficulties that the concerned Governments face in fighting armed insurgent groups , she notes with concern that in some countries Governments have adopted counter-insurgency strategies , often involving excessive and indiscriminate use of force , aimed at targeting those suspected of being members , collaborators or sympathizers of those groups , leading to further violations of the right to life .  
In this respect , my delegation commends the timely advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice which asserts that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international humanitarian law applicable to armed conflicts .  
Legislative Decree No . 895 of 1998 , enacted to combat organized crime by armed groups , punishes as a perpetrator of aggravated terrorism ( even if it is an ordinary offence ) any member or accomplice of a criminal group who carries firearms or explosives to commit any offence against life , physical integrity , health , property , individual freedom or public security , even if the perpetrator acts alone .  
Reforms were needed to protect the rights of the child : education must be improved , childrens courts must be reformed , the practice of recruiting minors to the armed forces must be stopped , hazardous child labour must be prohibited , and the sexual exploitation of children ( who were often exposed to infection by the human immunodeficiency virus ) must be combated more effectively .  
Hiring private companies providing security and military assistance and advice is no substitute for maintaining a collective regional security system and genuinely professional national armed forces and security forces loyal to the democratic legal order.It is a false solution . 
Without obviating the need to clarify , refine , update and expand the rules of customary international and treaty law to combat mercenary activity , it should be established as a principle that , in essence , the aim of such rules is to condemn a mercenary act in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to the humanitarian standards that apply to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
Specifically , it is neither lawful nor advisable , no matter how often short _ term or emergency reasons are invoked , to entrust a country ' s security and the speedy settlement of armed conflicts to private companies which hire mercenaries to achieve those objectives and will earn substantial economic profits for their participation .  
At its fifty _ fourth session , the Commission , in resolution 1998-75 , recognizing the urgent need for the adoption of effective measures , nationally , regionally and internationally , to protect the civilian population , especially women and children , in northern Uganda from the effects of armed conflict , requested the Secretary _ General to report on the implementation of that resolution to the Commission at its fifty _ fifth session .  
In some areas , the police make special raids on Roma communities - armed assaults in the early hours of the morning , during which houses are searched , the contents ransacked , inhabitants , including women , the elderly and children , harassed or subjected to excessive force , and men rounded up for arrest and questioning , usually without search and arrest warrants .  
Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments , pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts ,  
Numerous testimonies received by the Special Rapporteur indicate that the civilian population living in or near the combat zone is generally forced to move : in these " grey zones " ( zones controlled or influenced by the insurgents ) the armed forces often resort to searches , destruction and burning of houses , and confiscation of property and food to force the people to move , temporarily or permanently .  
At a public sitting on 8 July 1996 , the International Court of Justice recognized for the first time in history that the threat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict , and in particular the principles and rules of humanitarian law , also recognizing that there exists an obligation for all States to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament .  
This is why we will not support proposals that are designed to subordinate respect for human rights in the context of armed conflict , in accordance with international humanitarian law , to questionable military requirements .  
The introduction to the Principles contains a refinement of previous working definitions : internally displaced persons are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence , in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict , situations of generalized violence , violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters , and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , in the last few years , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
Strongly deploring the rising toll of casualties among humanitarian personnel and United Nations personnel in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular armed conflicts and post-conflict situations , and strongly condemning the acts of physical violence and harassment to which those participating in humanitarian operations are too frequently exposed ,  
The persisting armed hostilities in Afghanistan and the complex nature of the conflict , including ethnic , religious and political aspects , which have resulted in extensive human suffering , forced displacement , including on the grounds of ethnicity , and which hinder the return of the internally displaced to their homes ;  
The laundering of money accruing from illegal drug trafficking , and the use of such money in order to finance illegal activities , such as providing financial support for armed rebel movements that threatened legitimate Governments , posed a threat to international peace and security and made it essential for the international community to cooperate with the relevant international bodies . 
The Nordic countries considered that the primary rules had now been codified in the major fields of international law , including treaty law , diplomatic and consular law , human rights law , the law of the sea and humanitarian law applicable in armed conflicts .  
Stressing the importance of adherence to international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law in order to avert mass exoduses and to protect refugees and internally displaced persons , and expressing its deep concern at the lack of respect for these laws and principles , especially during armed conflict , including the denial of safe and unimpeded access to the displaced ,  
At the impact of the current armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effect on the civilian population , in particular women and children , at continuing serious violations of human rights , and international humanitarian law by all parties , in particular :  
This political partnership for peace deserves to be supported , especially since through negotiations it is involved in negotiations specifically with the armed and unarmed outside opposition to arrive at an overall peace agreement on which future transition institutions will base themselves to prepare a state of law respectful of human rights and of democratic freedoms .  
Also concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
Concerned also that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially vulnerable to violence ,  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 2 December 1999 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , concerning a fresh act of aggression carried out by Turkish armed forces in the territory of northern Iraq that constitutes a flagrant violation of Iraq ' s sovereignty and territorial integrity and poses a grave threat to its national and regional security . 
I should like to draw your attention to the fact that on 23 November 1999 units of the Turkish armed forces consisting of two brigades supported by armoured cars and the forces maintained in the area following previous hostile operations carried out a fresh act of aggression against the territory of northern Iraq .  
When , after the end of the cold war , the world seemed to be developing towards a promising situation because of the gradual reduction of interState conflicts , the African continent suddenly fell victim to armed confrontations of unprecedented violence .  
Indeed , today more than ever , conflictprevention must become a global and integrated strategy to ensure in the long term not only the absence of armed conflict , but that conditions remain conducive to political , economic , social and cultural peace .  
These include local and regional armed conflicts , growing indebtedness , rampant poverty , scarcity of financial resources , and the spread of dangerous diseases such as HIV / AIDS and malaria .  
To come together in order to counter the evil role played by diamonds in armed conflict is an excellent , irreproachable initiative , because this illicit trade is prejudicial to peace , particularly in Africa .  
They build on the fundamental norm of the law of armed conflict that military necessity in armed conflict has to be constantly set against the humanitarian objective of preventing unnecessary suffering .  
There has been an increase in violent conflict , in particular , intraState armed conflict , often rooted in political transition , economic dislocation , fragile civil society and a weakening of the State .  
That was demonstrated by the current social unrest in Benin ( varying from a merciless pursuit of armed gangs of looters to a widespread strike of civil servants ) , which was rooted in the economic problems linked to the countrys underdevelopment .  
The new spiral of fierce armed resistance begun by the Taliban has led to a worsening of the suffering of the Afghan population and to new flagrant violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law .  
The interstate wars of the Cold War years had been succeeded by intrastate armed conflicts , often underpinned by political transition , economic dislocation , weak civil society and a weakening of the State , leading to virtual anarchy .  
Some also expressed concern that not requiring that military firearms be marked and recorded would make them untraceable if they later fell into nonmilitary possession as a result of loss in armed conflicts , theft or other diversions .  
The increasing challenges posed by poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions and situations of armed conflict must be confronted with determination if the rights of children and of future generations were to be protected .  
The Council further stressed the importance of a coordinated international response to economic , social , cultural or humanitarian problems , which are often the root causes of armed conflicts .  
It was agreed that the organization should enhance its capacity to predict and respond to a changing global environment , marked by increased frequency and intensity of civil strife , armed conflict and natural disasters .  
Formidable challenges arising from persistent poverty and widening economic and social disparities , humanitarian crises caused by armed conflict and natural disasters , and the growing HIV / AIDS pandemic provided the context for much of UNICEF work in 1999 .  
Bearing this in mind , Russia is open to a broad dialogue aimed at reaching agreement on specific ways to mobilize the additional potential of international political and legal means for the protection of civilians in armed conflict .  
We are greatly concerned by the fact that genocide , ethnic cleansing and other gross violations of human rights have not only become linked to modern armed conflicts , but , in manner of speaking , have developed into just another way of waging war .  
Some also expressed concern that not requiring that military firearms be marked and recorded would make them untraceable if they later fell into nonmilitary possession as a result of loss in armed conflicts , theft or other diversions .  
These problems may include geographical and demographical problems , poor institutional setups , ethnic tensions ( 18 African LDCs have been involved in armed conflicts since independence ) and weak , often dualistic , product markets .  
On the technological level , new weapons research and development has continued unabated , with the emergence of more accurate nuclear ballistic missile systems and the deployment of highly accurate nuclear armed cruise missiles .  
It is generally recognized that the modern world is still characterized by the persistence of armed conflicts , which continue to cause human losses and mass violations of human rights , as well as economic , social and cultural devastation .  
If the political will is summoned to deny the ability of warring factions to sustain their illicit trade in natural resources , a vital lifeline that supports and sustains armed conflict will be degraded , if not destroyed .  
The international community should make any assistance political , diplomatic , financial , material or military to parties to armed conflict contingent on their observing standards for the protection of children .  
In contrast , a very large poor and indigent population excluded and lacking social cohesion can coexist with privileged professionals who receive benefits from public transfers , such as the armed forces or unionized workers in finance and banking .  
However , the tragic murder in August of seven Afghan workers of the United Nationssupported mine awareness programme by an unidentified armed band in western Afghanistan confirmed the everyday risks faced by humanitarian personnel .  
All this is accompanied by the establishment of illegal armed formations , blatant interference from abroad in the affairs of sovereign States and the creation of new hotbeds of tension , leading increasingly to the largescale loss of innocent lives .  
While we understand that armed conflict may occur within States , we do not agree to limiting the concept of prevention to intra-State conflict , given that continuing , potentially explosive regional and international situations require major efforts to prevent them from erupting into global armed conflicts .  
National Governments and local authorities are called upon to respond properly and in a timely fashion to the political , economic , social and humanitarian circumstances that have the potential to lead to armed conflict or to the intensification of an ongoing conflict .  
The constraints imposed by severe poverty on economic development and social progress in some developing countries , combined with other factors , such as ethnic and territorial dispute , have caused disturbances , and even armed conflict , in these countries .  
Despite the efforts of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to facilitate recovery , the people there continue to suffer , with admirable courage , the vicissitudes of a long political transition process that is having a devastating effect on economic structures , as well as the ravages of two successive armed conflicts that have hampered the speedy reconstruction of the country and of the social infrastructure , which has been hard hit by the years of crises . 
We also recommend that positive consideration be given to the Secretary-Generals practical and action-oriented recommendations , in particular those that are targeted at enhancing the capacity of national Governments and the international community to prosecute violations of international humanitarian law ; improving engagement by the Security Council and others with a view to obtaining access to vulnerable populations for humanitarian operations ; and developing clear criteria and procedures for the identification and separation of armed elements in situations of massive population displacement .  
In an act of international solidarity that is commensurate with existing needs , the international community must commit itself to helping the Democratic Republic of the Congo , particularly through the appropriate resumption of multilateral and bilateral structural cooperation , as well as by providing access to various debt-relief mechanisms , including the facilities enjoyed by countries emerging from an armed conflict under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative .  
Second , Jamaica supports the steps proposed by the Secretary-General to enhance his traditional preventive role with respect to : the increased use of United Nations interdisciplinary fact-finding and confidence-building missions ; to develop regional prevention strategies with regional partners and appropriate United Nations organs and agencies , including the possibility of establishing liaison offices with regional organizations ; to use eminent persons for advice and action in support of preventing and resolving armed conflicts ; and to improve the capacity and resource base for preventive action in the Secretariat .  
The root causes of the armed conflicts in the world today can be found in very complex economic , social , historic and religious issues , as well as in the tribal and territorial problems that are a legacy of colonialism .  
Finally , let me express our hope that the current open debate , focused on the Secretary-Generals report on conflict prevention , will foster the effective implementation of the recommendations contained therein and contribute to the goal of mobilizing the collective potential of the United Nations , its Member States and other international stakeholders in eliminating the threat of the emergence of armed conflicts .  
In this respect , the presence of political leaders who are prepared to handle social complaints and demands by violent means with a view to satisfying selfish political and economic ambitions is the real cause of , and an inevitable catalyst of , social violence and armed conflicts .  
In Zaire and in Haiti , the armed conflicts resulted from the actions of hardened , corrupt , dictatorial governments that turned their backs on the civilian population and established violence as the norm of political discourse and squandered national resources .  
It reiterates its position that the primary responsibility for the continued fighting lies with the leadership of the armed faction of the Unio Nacional Para a Independencia Total de Angola ( UNITA ) headed by Mr . J . Savimbi , which is refusing to fulfil its obligations under the Accordos de Paz ( S / 22609 , annex ) , the Lusaka Protocol ( S / 1994 / 1441 , annex ) and relevant resolutions of the Security Council , which remain the only viable basis for political settlement of the conflict in Angola .  
After the disengagement phase has been successfully completed , there will be numerous complex tasks ahead in the peace process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in terms of moving forward the disarmament and demobilization of the armed groups and achieving the withdrawal of foreign forces from the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Although we believe that the main responsibility for bridging this gap and implementing international rules aimed at protecting children in armed conflicts lies above all with national Governments , we are also fully convinced that the international community has an important role to play in providing the necessary technical and financial support to protect , reintegrate and psychologically rehabilitate children .  
The consequences of war , acts of genocide , armed conflicts , family violence , international terrorism , organized crime , and trafficking in humans and drugs , as well as weapons of mass destruction and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , have devastating consequences for children and a profound impact on their lives and their communities .  
While the Government of Burundi is satisfied by the conclusions of the Panel of Experts concerning charges pertaining to the alleged involvement of Burundi in the illegal exploitation of the natural resources of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , the delegation of Burundi is , however , concerned by information contained in certain paragraphs of the addendum regarding assistance granted to the armed groups Forces pour la dfense de la dmocratie ( FDD ) and Forces nationales pour la libration ( FNL ) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo . 
That can become a reality only if coercive and firm measures are taken against the FDD and FNL armed groups , which have stepped up their violent actions against the innocent population since the establishment of the transitional Government , and which no longer have any political justification for turning a deaf ear to appeals for negotiation and ceasefire . 
The ongoing series of hostile operations and the flagrant violations of Iraqs territory and airspace that are being committed by the Turkish armed forces only confirm Iraqs repeated warnings against the consequences of the duplicitous policy being pursued by Turkey vis - - vis the anomalous situation in northern Iraq and against Turkeys participation in perpetuating that situation by open interference in the internal affairs of Iraq .  
The long series of armed conflicts in Africa inevitably involving mercenaries organized in various ways offers harsh and brutal proof of the fact that the real and effective exercise of the right of many African peoples to self-determination has not been realized .  
However , a glance at the present pattern of armed conflicts , whether internal or international , and the fact that mercenaries are involved in most of them would seem to confirm the opinion held by the Office of the Special Rapporteur , namely , that mercenary activities are continuing in many parts of the world and that the presence of mercenaries is still connected with situations that affect the self-determination of peoples as well as peace , political stability , life , physical integrity , freedom and security .  
The aim of the rules of customary international and treaty law is , in essence , to combat mercenary acts in the broad sense of the buying and selling of military services that are not subject to prevailing standards of international humanitarian law applying to armed conflicts and that are likely to lead to war crimes and human rights violations .  
She further notes with regret that in some countries Governments have made use of excessive and indiscriminate force in their efforts to counter armed opposition groups , which in some cases has involved summary executions of captured combatants and resulted in extensive civilian casualties and fatalities .  
These developments have contributed to improving protection of individuals in all situations through , for example , the elaboration of the rules applicable in internal armed conflict , the establishment of individual criminal responsibility under international law for violations of laws applicable to all armed conflicts and the clarification of the conditions under which a State may be held responsible for acts by non-State entities .  
Mines and other sources of natural wealth are remote and heavily guarded , often located in areas subject to outbreaks of fighting or armed attacks against the local population .  
Determined to alleviate the plight of populations in the regions of the world besieged by armed conflicts and criminality , which are fuelled by illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , in a manner that would bring the benefits of social and economic development and national , regional and international stability ,  
Develop and adopt effective programmes for the collection , safe storage , destruction and responsible disposal of firearms rendered surplus , redundant or obsolete through , inter alia , peace agreements , demobilization or integration of ex-combatants or re-equipping or restructuring of national armed forces or armed State bodies ;  
The political instability and the natural resources of certain countries , by exciting the greed of foreign interests which had allies in the interior of the country , lay at the origin of the numerous armed conflicts in that continent .  
It should also be noted that serious offences against international humanitarian law , as defined in the Criminal Code , are much more severely punished when members of the armed forces are accused , and acts formerly treated as ordinary crimes are also covered .  
The success of a number of civic movements in winning mayoral elections , the appointment of a Guambian governor in the Department of Cauca - the first indigenous ethnic minority-group representative ever to be elected - and , in general , the maintenance of democratic institutions in a context of internal armed conflict all bear witness to the unbending will of the Government and the State in general to respect political rights .  74 .  There have also been many large demonstrations calling for peace and protesting against violations of fundamental rights .  
In view of the unstable security situation in the country and in order to avoid potential security gaps related to the continuing repatriation of ECOMOG troops , significant resources were utilized for the transportation by air of contingent-owned equipment , stores and supplies , as well as for the strengthening of UNAMSIL air operations capability by enhancing its helicopter fleet with armed military helicopters and commercial heavy-lift rotary aircraft .  
To regularly review the stocks of small arms and light weapons held by armed forces , police and other authorized bodies and to ensure that such stocks surplus to requirements are clearly identified , [ and that programmes for the responsible and expeditious disposal , normally through destruction , of such stocks are established and implemented ] and that such stocks are adequately safeguarded until disposal .  
How was it possible for children to fully enjoy their rights to education , to a healthy childhood , to play and recreation , and to healthy development in other words , all the rights to which they were entitled as human beings when they were confronted daily with the appalling consequences of armed conflict and foreign occupation , when they lacked even the most basic needs and when their very protection and survival were at stake ?  
Tribute should be paid to the organizations of the United Nations system , Governments and the international community , especially non-governmental organizations , for the work they were doing to help , at both the psychological and the physical level , millions of children living in abject circumstances because they were victims of poverty , a precarious economic or social situation , sickness , natural disasters , armed conflicts , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , disabilities or lack of legal protection .  
It was therefore imperative that the relevant activists in political and civil society , including parents , teachers and religious and community leaders , should join hands to revive the traditional safeguards for women and children by creating a culture of respect for diversity and promoting peaceful coexistence among all sections of society .  Pakistan hoped that the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict would go a long way to addressing that issue .  
According to the statistics , which were distressing , as a result of armed conflict some 2-million children had died , and countless numbers had been wounded , orphaned , traumatized , displaced or maimed by landmines , forcibly conscripted into armed groups , abducted or abused ; the situation was further compounded by the abundance of small arms and anti-personnel landmines .  
Despite the existence of an array of international legal instruments to protect children in armed conflict , the human rights of children continued to be violated with impunity ; there was clearly a need to reverse the trend from blatant disregard to strict observance of those instruments .  
Appeals to all Governments to ensure that all persons deprived of their liberty are treated with humanity and with respect for the inherent dignity of the human person and that conditions in places of detention conform to the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and , where applicable , to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977 in relation to the treatment of prisoners in armed conflicts , as well as to other pertinent international instruments ;  
Given the vehement and heroic resistance of the Iraqi armed forces , and foremost among them the valiant air defence forces , to this brutal aggression , the United States and the United Kingdom have resorted to a crude method of breaking the legitimate resistance of Iraqis , namely dropping from the air on Iraqi towns and villages leaflets cautioning the Iraqi armed forces against engaging the attacking United States and British aircraft and threatening to destroy sites that orient their radar systems or from which fire is directed in order to oppose these aircraft .  
While the plan for the withdrawal of all foreign forces awaits completion , I am confident that continued implementation of the Lusaka Agreement and the Kampala / Harare disengagement plans , further bilateral contacts and a joint commitment to address the issue of the armed groups in the eastern provinces constitute the surest way of achieving a lasting settlement and the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Democratic Republic of the Congo .  
Recalling the inclusion of gender-related crimes and crimes of sexual violence in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ( A / CONF . 183 / 9 ) , which affirms that rape , sexual slavery , enforced prostitution , forced pregnancy , enforced sterilization and other forms of sexual violence constitute , in defined circumstances , a crime against humanity and / or a war crime , and reiterating that acts of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict can constitute serious violations or grave breaches of international humanitarian law ,  
Deeply concerned that some groups of women , such as women belonging to minority groups , indigenous women , refugee women , migrant women , women living in rural or remote communities , destitute women , women in institutions or in detention , the girl child , women with disabilities , elderly women and women in situations of armed conflict , are especially targeted and vulnerable to violence ,  
Condemns violence against women committed in situations of armed conflict , such as murder , rape , including systematic rape , sexual slavery and forced pregnancy , and calls for effective responses to these violations of international human rights and humanitarian law ;  
Profoundly concerned that the situation of children in many parts of the world remains critical as a result of the persistence of poverty , inadequate social and economic conditions in an increasingly globalized world economy , pandemics , in particular HIV / AIDS , natural disasters , armed conflicts , displacement , exploitation , illiteracy , hunger , intolerance , discrimination , disability and inadequate legal protection , and convinced that urgent and effective national and international action is called for ,  
Calls upon all States to protect refugee children , unaccompanied children seeking asylum and internally displaced children , who are particularly exposed to risks in connection with armed conflict , such as recruitment , sexual violence and exploitation , to pay particular attention to programmes for voluntary repatriation , and wherever possible , local integration and resettlement , to give priority to family tracing and reunification , and , where appropriate , to cooperate with international humanitarian and refugee organizations ;  
In 2000 , several set-backs and longstanding problems impeded progress for children , such as persistent poverty , high debt burdens of many developing countries ( despite some debt relief for heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPCs ) , the still-expanding HIV / AIDS pandemic , armed conflicts , and natural disasters in Afghanistan , El Salvador , India and Southern Africa .  
These two countries are using armed force on a daily basis against the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Iraq in the two no-flight zones that they imposed by their unilateral decision , and these two countries are supporting , funding and training terrorist groups for the purpose of undermining Iraqs security and threatening its territorial integrity . 
I am also concerned at the deterioration in public security , reflected in an increase in crime , in actions by armed criminal groups and in the continuing very serious threats against persons involved in criminal proceedings and intimidation of members of non-governmental human rights organizations .  
The recent surge in these activities by Pakistan , however , is a mere supplement to its widespread presence in Afghanistan , as Pakistan maintains thousands of military personnel , non-commissioned officers , armed nationals belonging to numerous Pakistan-based extremist organizations and volunteers from religious schools called the Madrassa , fighting alongside the Taliban mercenaries .  
It also points to two defining elements of the philosophy underlying the collective security system : first , preventing armed conflict is a more desirable and cost-effective strategy to ensure lasting peace and security than trying to stop it or alleviate its symptoms ; and second , armed international conflicts are best prevented by peaceful means in such a manner that international peace and security are not endangered , as provided for in Article 2 , paragraph 3 , of the Charter .  
A Framework team , composed of senior representatives of 14 departments , agencies , programmes and offices , including the World Bank , meets monthly to exchange information from their respective areas of competence and to assess the potential for armed conflict , complex emergencies or other circumstances that may provide a prima facie case for United Nations involvement .  
Apart from the shared feature that their host countries were not involved in a violent internal or international conflict , the common features included the possibility , or even the likelihood , of armed conflict , consent of the States concerned to the peacekeeping operations as the form of prevention , and the authorization of the operation by the Security Council .  
Efforts to prevent armed conflict should promote a broad range of human rights , including not only civil and political rights but also economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development .  
From 31 August to 7 September 2001 , the World Conference Against Racism , Racial Discrimination , Xenophobia and Related Intolerance will discuss many of the issues linked to racial and ethnic conflicts , and I hope that it will make concrete recommendations , including on early warning systems , confidence-building measures and structural and institutional support mechanisms to prevent the deterioration of ethnic tensions into armed conflict .  
By 2003 , have in place national strategies to address the spread of HIV among national uniformed services , where this is required , including armed forces and civil defence force and consider ways of using personnel from these services who are educated and trained in HIV / AIDS awareness and prevention to assist with HIV / AIDS awareness and prevention activities including participation in emergency , humanitarian , disaster relief and rehabilitation assistance ;  
It is , moreover , well-understood that the illegal use of force in international relations will be considered under customary international law , international human rights and humanitarian law , the law of armed conflict and international criminal law .  
This legal / political controversy , however , belongs not in the debate on terrorism but in debates on which provisions of humanitarian law apply - those governing civil wars or those governing wars identified in article 1.4 of Additional Protocol I . [ 109 ] That debate would have to take into account , of course , the principle of self-determination , as set out in the Charter of the United Nations , human rights instruments and resolutions , with regard to the armed conflict in question . 
The occupying power may , then , invoke its long occupancy as proof that its occupation is legitimate and characterize any and all use of force against it as terrorism . [ 115 ] ( b ) There is a situation of nascent civil war - i.e . , a situation where there are armed groups who either do not control sufficient territory , or who engage in military activities that are more than sporadic but less than sustained , or whose actions do not qualify as military actions under the laws and customs of war . 
Many years had to elapse and great human and material resources had to be expended for the world to realize something that should have been an obvious truth ; that the early identification of trends leading to crises and the timely forestalling of their development into armed clashes are much more effective in every respect than extinguishing conflicts in their heated phase .  
I am referring to the need to elaborate , under United Nations auspices , a comprehensive strategy in this field that would encompass a whole range of problems , including some that are already being addressed by the international community , such as the problems of conflict diamonds , the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons , combating the drug trade and the training of mercenaries and the financing of illegal armed groups .  
A recent study by the Center for International Development and Conflict Management at the University of Maryland , based on a study of 160 countries , has concluded that armed conflicts decreased in number and intensity by about half in the 1990s , the number of democratic Governments has vastly increased and the number of power-sharing agreements to end ethnic fighting has also increased .  
The term countermeasures covers that part of the subject of reprisals not associated with armed conflict , and in accordance with modern practice and judicial decisions the term is used in that sense in this Chapter . [ 3 ] Countermeasures are to be contrasted with retorsion , i.e . unfriendly conduct which is not inconsistent with any international obligation of the State engaging in it even though it may be a response to an internationally wrongful act . 
To ensure , subject to the respective constitutional and legal systems of States , that the armed forces , police or any other body authorized to hold small arms and light weapons establish adequate and detailed standards and procedures relating to the management and security of their stocks of these weapons .  
To regularly review , subject to the respective constitutional and legal systems of States , where appropriate , the stocks of small arms and light weapons held by armed forces , police and other authorized bodies and to ensure that such stocks declared by competent national authorities to be surplus to requirements are clearly identified , and that programmes for the responsible disposal , preferably through destruction , of such stocks are established and implemented and that such stocks are adequately safeguarded until disposal .  
Only those who are brainwashed enough to believe that ends justify means are capable of regarding a total of more than 230 armed attacks killing 70 innocent people , including 31 Turkish diplomats , and wounding 524 civilians as individual acts ; and only those , I would like to add , can claim such unabashed defence of evil .  
The Armenian falsifiers would rather prefer to claim that if any single Turk was killed during these tragic times , then that was strictly due to self-defence , that no civilian Turks were murdered , raped or pillaged whereas even the Tsarist officers were horrified to see the frenzy of massacring defenceless Turks perpetrated by armed Armenian gangs and paramilitaries in the most vicious manner .  
ICRC , the organization charged with systematically defending and developing international humanitarian law , argues that armed conflict is one of the key reasons for the lack of food and violations of the right to food , yet the international debate on the right to food has made little reference to international humanitarian law . 23 ICRC argues that humanitarian law contains many provisions that relate to the protection of access to food in armed conflict situations and must therefore be seen as an essential component of the legal framework that protects the right to food . 
The Ministers expressed their serious concern for the threats to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Macedonia in recent months by ethnic Albanian extremist groups , strongly condemning their terrorist acts and armed violence and calling on these groups to stop their actions , to release the hostages , to lay down their weapons and to withdraw immediately from the occupied areas .  
The heightened attention of the Council to the situation in Burundi was dictated by the rapidly deteriorating military situation in the country at the end of February and the beginning of March and the increased violence , including the attacks by Burundian armed groups on the capital .  On 2 March , the Council members , during consultations of the whole , heard a briefing by the Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Kieran Prendergast , on the current political , military , humanitarian and socio-economic situation in Burundi and developments in the Arusha peace process in the past months .  
It has been generally recognized within the international community that the excessive accumulation and circulation and the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons pose a global threat to peace and security .  The ready availability of small arms contributes to the intensification of armed conflicts and to increased levels of violence .  
In that connection they pointed out that States had an obligation to exercise control so as to prohibit security firms from participating in armed conflicts , creating private armies , engaging in illicit arms trafficking , being involved in the illegal extraction of natural resources and , in that context , employing mercenaries .  
With greater support from the General Assembly and the Commission , the Special Rapporteur will thus be enabled to continue to investigate such phenomena as the role of mercenaries in internal or international armed conflicts affecting the right of peoples to self-determination and at the same time to consider other phenomena in which mercenaries have a criminal involvement , such as illicit trafficking , terrorism and the formation of mercenary teams by private security companies , which use them to intervene in the internal affairs of States with which the companies sign contracts .  
All this may give rise to interference by mercenaries who , motivated by payment , may commit terrorist acts , attacks against persons , cultural objects or economic facilities , engage in illicit trafficking , or provoke armed or other conflicts with a view to carrying out violent and destabilizing assignments which have a profound impact on the enjoyment of human rights .  
The currently accepted meaning or use of the term mercenary is primarily focused on including in this rubric the hiring of the professional services of persons with a military background who are paid to intervene in an armed conflict in a country other than their own .  
In such a culture , Governments would live up to their responsibilities , armed groups would respect the recognized rules of international humanitarian law , the private sector would be conscious of the impact of its engagement in crisis areas , and Member States and international organizations would display the necessary commitment to ensuring decisive and rapid action in the face of crisis .  
In a multi-faction conflict , such as that in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , experience has shown that , in order to gain meaningful and regular access to vulnerable populations within different combat zones , where front lines are shifting from day to day , the consent of many parties has to be obtained at the local , regional , national and international levels .  They may include a range of armed groups and other non-State actors with often diverse or obscure political , economic and strategic goals .  
Member States are nevertheless still reluctant to support the work of humanitarian agencies in these circumstances , because of the perceived security risk to their military personnel and the risk of further exacerbating the conflict by direct confrontations with armed elements .  Ensuring security in camps requires the involvement of police and military forces , not least in disarming and demobilizing militias and transferring them to different sites .  
I would therefore like to recall the prohibition against targeting civilians and conducting indiscriminate attacks on civilians , enshrined in customary international humanitarian law , which is binding not only on States and their Governments but equally and directly so on armed groups that are parties to the conflict , as stated in article 3 common to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 . 
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
The forms of conflict most prevalent in the world today are internal communal violence , ethnic cleansing , terrorism , private wars financed by the international trade in diamonds or oil and involve a proliferation of armed groups .  
I encourage the Security Council to conduct more frequent fact-finding missions to conflict areas with a view to identifying the specific requirements for humanitarian assistance , in particular obtaining safe and meaningful access to vulnerable populations .  In view of the prevalence of civil wars among todays conflicts , a structured dialogue with armed groups is indispensable for reaching and protecting vulnerable populations in times of war ( see paras . 30-32 and 48-50 ) .  
I urge Member States to adopt and enforce executive and legislative measures to prevent private sector actors within their jurisdiction from engaging in commercial activities with parties to armed conflict that might result in or contribute to systematic violations of international humanitarian and human rights law .  
At its fifty-seventh session , in April 2001 , the Commission on Human Rights adopted , without a vote , resolution 2001 / 13 on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan , in which it strongly condemned the mass killings and systematic human rights violations against civilians and persons deprived of their liberty , for reasons related to the armed conflict , resulting in the massive , forced displacement of the civilian population .  
It also noted with deep concern the continuing pattern of human rights violations in Afghanistan and the continuation of armed hostilities and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which had resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement .  
In view of the repeated massive violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Afghanistan , the High Commissioner called upon the international community to establish an independent international inquiry into the massacres and other grave human rights violations committed by parties to the armed conflict in Afghanistan .  
The armed conflict in the north and the south-west , which forced most of the countrys development projects to a halt , and the unstable social and political situation prevailing in Ethiopia and Somalia have accelerated the deterioration of the Djiboutian economy .  
The Permanent Mission of the Republic of San Marino to the United Nations would like to point out the fact that , given the characteristics of the San Marino armed forces , the Government of the Republic of San Marino deemed it inconvenient to fill out the questionnaire [ entitled Instrument for standardized international reporting of military expenditures ] and preferred to send the attached sheet of information .  
The end of the internal armed conflict and of an institutional policy that violated human rights represented a qualitative and quantitative improvement .  
Attacks against the civilian population and systematic killings and summary executions have been a part of the pattern of egregious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law perpetrated by different factions in the protracted armed conflict in Sierra Leone .  
Recalling that the fundamental rights of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups must be respected in all circumstances and that deliberate policies discriminating against women and girls in that country on the grounds of sex constitute gross and flagrant violations of the international instruments relating to human rights ,  
Considers it essential that the international community continue to follow very closely the situation of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups and bring the necessary pressure to bear so that all the restrictions imposed on women , which constitute flagrant and systematic violations of all the internationally recognized economic , social , cultural , civil and political rights , are removed ;  
Encourages continued United Nations activities aimed at promoting the fundamental rights of women and girls in the territories controlled by Afghan armed groups , and supports their efforts to create a humanitarian framework within which humanitarian operations can be conducted in a calm environment in the utmost safety and to induce the Taliban to comply with the provisions governing the conduct of such operations ;  
The Committee reminds the State party that even during armed conflict , fundamental human rights must be respected and that basic economic , social and cultural rights as part of the minimum standards of human rights are guaranteed under customary international law and are also prescribed by international humanitarian law .  
The Security Council underlines the importance of practical disarmament measures in averting armed conflicts and encourages States and relevant international and regional organizations to facilitate the appropriate cooperation of civil society actors in activities related to the prevention and combating of the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of and illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons , including facilitating greater awareness and better understanding of the nature and scope of this problem .  
Collaboration on issues of children affected by armed conflict that are relevant to the special session on children has been extensive and fruitful : the draft outcome document of the special session , on a world fit for children , contains important recommendations for the agenda on children affected by armed conflict , many joint events were convened during the sessions of the Preparatory Committee , and several significant joint initiatives were planned for the special session itself .  
Although weapons of mass destruction are the most threatening of weapons to our societies , in circumstances of civil war and armed conflicts small arms and light weapons have proved to be equally deadly and brutal .  
He also recognizes that progress has been made in addressing a number of historical human rights violations committed by the former government prior to October 2000 , including the release of many political prisoners , investigations into the fate of persons of different ethnic groups missing during the armed conflict in Kosovo in 1999 and criminal investigations into murdered or other disappeared persons .  
Belarus is convinced that a gradual movement from simple to more complex bilateral and multilateral measures and agreements will create a solid basis for preventing armed conflict and strengthening national and regional security , which in turn are integral elements of the modern architecture of a comprehensive and indivisible system of international security .  
Noting with concern the devastating effects of difficult social and economic conditions , armed conflicts , wars , natural disasters , infectious diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria , and of the HIV / AIDS pandemic on family life and stability ,  
He noted with regret that despite all the collective commitments made by heads of State and Government at the various international conferences held over the past decade and in the Millennium Declaration particularly with regard to social development and poverty eradication , national , regional and international challenges to the fulfilment of those commitments , such as armed and civil racial conflicts , genocide , enforced displacement , the proliferation of drugs , organized crime and terrorism against innocent persons were increasing in an unprecedented manner .  
Notwithstanding the fresh hopes for a safer environment brought about by the end of the cold war , the world has experienced a proliferation of regional conflicts and armed hostilities , and has witnessed a trend towards the spread and destabilizing accumulation of sophisticated weapons systems , including weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery .  
Many participants stressed that the process of building a democracy that is rooted in a culture of tolerance and respect for diversity was a crucial element in strengthening the capacity of a State to prevent , manage and settle conflicts by peaceful means , given that social exclusion , intolerance and unequal access to vital resources were often at the root of todays armed conflicts .  
As elaborated in my recent report on the prevention of armed conflict ( A / 55 / 985-S / 2001 / 574 and Corr . 1 ) , to be effective a conflict prevention strategy needs to address the multidimensional root causes of conflict through a variety of political , legal , economic and other measures involving the many parts of the United Nations system and incorporating a regional dimension .  
The sides have stated that an essential precondition for the transfer of the resolution of the situation in Afghanistan to the political channel is the unconditional fulfilment of the demands of the anti-terrorist coalition , including the handing-over of those who inspired and organized the terrorist acts of 11 September 2001 in New York and Washington , D.C . , the abolition of the rule of the Taliban , who have provided shelter for terrorist and extremist groups on the territory they control , and the disbandment and complete disarmament of their armed units . 
As a consequence , the plague of hijackings of aircraft in mid-flight soon spread to the United States itself , where , for the most varied reasons , a number of people , most of them unbalanced individuals , adventurers or common criminals , from both the United States and Latin America , began to hijack aircraft , armed with firearms , knives , Molotov cocktails and sometimes just bottles of water made to look as though they contained gasoline , with which they threatened to set the aircraft on fire .  
In Central America we have made great progress , not only in the process of transition involving painstaking work in the area of pacifying , disarming and reintegrating armed groups into civil life , as well as campaigns to promote tolerance and peaceful coexistence and integration into political , social and cultural life but also in creating awareness among our peoples about the need to develop a culture of peace , which is closely related to the promotion of civic and democratic values .  
Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the past few years , in particular in armed conflicts and in post-conflict situations , which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives , in particular of civilians , the suffering of victims , flows of refugees and internally displaced persons , as well as material destruction , which disrupt the development efforts of the countries affected , in particular those of developing countries ,  
Calls upon all Governments and parties in complex humanitarian emergencies , in particular in armed conflicts and in post-conflict situations , in countries in which humanitarian personnel are operating , in conformity with the relevant provisions of international law and national laws , to cooperate fully with the United Nations and other humanitarian agencies and organizations and to ensure the safe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel in order to allow them to perform efficiently their task of assisting the affected civilian population , including refugees and internally displaced persons ;  
In its preambular part , the draft resolution reaffirms prior resolutions that emphasize and acknowledge the importance of international , bilateral and multilateral economic , financial and technical support , cooperation and assistance for peacekeeping and peace-building in Central America following armed conflict and natural disasters .  
Respect fully international human rights law and international humanitarian law applicable to the rights and protection of women and girls and take special measures to protect women and girls from gender-based violence , particularly rape and all other forms of sexual violence during armed conflict , and end impunity and prosecute those responsible for genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes , including those relating to sexual and other gender-based violence against women and girls ;  
The direct or indirect sale or provision to the territory of Afghanistan under Taliban control , as stipulated by the Security Council Committee established pursuant to resolution 1267 , of technical advice , assistance or training related to the military activities of the armed personnel under the control of the Taliban is prohibited ;

Recognize that sexual violence during armed conflict constituting serious violations of international humanitarian law has been used as a tool of systematic forms of discrimination , abuse and genocide directed against racial or ethnic populations of non-combatants , and that race and gender combine to make women particularly vulnerable to certain types of violence , particularly sexual violence ;  
The severe insecurity , which seriously hampers the ability of humanitarian organizations to secure access to affected populations , particularly in the zones held by armed rebels and under the control of foreign forces , while condemning the killing of six humanitarian workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross on 26 April 2001 in Ituri Province , for which those responsible must be brought to justice ;  
At the impact of the ongoing armed conflict on the situation of human rights and its adverse effects on the civilian population , in particular women and children , and at the continuing serious violations of human rights , fundamental freedoms and international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict , in particular :  
The situation of human rights in the Democratic Republic of the Congo , and particularly in the zones held by the armed rebels and under foreign occupation , and the persistent violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , including the atrocities against the civilian populations , usually committed with complete impunity , while emphasizing in this regard that all the forces present in the territory of the Democratic Republic of the Congo should be held accountable for the violations of human rights in the territories under their control .  
The severe insecurity , which seriously hampers the ability of humanitarian organizations to secure access to affected populations , particularly in the zones held by armed rebels and under the control of foreign forces , while condemning the killing of six humanitarian workers of the International Committee of the Red Cross on 26 April 2001 in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , for which those responsible must be brought to justice ;
