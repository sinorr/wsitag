An international and independent court that was free from political pressures , established on a solid legal basis , accepted by all States to deal with well-defined crimes and capable of offering maximum guarantees to the defendants would provide , particularly where prevention was concerned , an appropriate instrument for dealing with crises which had adverse effects on entire peoples .  
Such a body , linked to the United Nations system and established on a solid legal basis accepted by all States , would be a useful tool which would allow the international community to prosecute and punish those guilty of particularly serious crimes whose hateful nature constituted an insult to the human conscience .

The question arises , with growing urgency , as to whether any juridical legitimacy that could , arguably , have been derived from past acquiescence in the assumption of power by the Military Forces can any longer provide a defensible basis for the continued maintenance of a non-constitutional system based on the assumption of martial powers , having such an unfavourable impact on human rights in the context of generally accepted international norms and the obligations undertaken by Myanmar .  
At the same time , the absence of an independent judiciary , coupled with a host of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct , prescribing enormously disproportionate penalties and authorizing arrest and detention without judicial review or any other form of judicial authorization , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions in Myanmar are arbitrary when measured by generally accepted international standards .

The idea of concentrating United Nations efforts on a situation that may become an inflamed dispute likely to endanger international peace and security has now been accepted , but the United Nations has not developed a special mechanism to deal with so many current crises .  While the then Secretary-General reorganized the Secretariat in such a way that information on incipient crises is being collected , the Secretariat is being downsized and is not likely to be increased to deal with an avalanche of new problems .  
The precautionary approach is widely accepted as a fundamental concept of national environmental laws and regulations in order to protect the environment . 76 It is elaborated , for instance , in the Water Law and Planning Law of Israel , 77 in the Environmental Protection Act of the Czech Republic , 54 and is included in numerous draft environmental laws currently under consideration - for example in the Pakistan draft environmental protection act of 1996 .

This is demonstrated by the fact that until 1952 , in the preparatory work for article 4 of the Covenant , the original version covered states of war , although the latter reference was abandoned in favour of the generic formula public emergency to avoid giving the impression that the United Nations authorized , or at least accepted , war .  
While there is not yet a universally accepted definition of terrorism _ academics and experts tending to approach the phenomenon from varying perspectives , and Governments tending to label as acts of terrorism manifestations of the phenomenon which directly affect their own interests while remaining unconcerned about the emergencies of others _ admittedly , one of the major difficulties standing in the way of consensus has been the continuing controversy about wars of national liberation and the motives advanced to justify violence .

It was unfortunate that a few countries refused to acknowledge that the issue had been settled once and for all by resolution 2758 ( XXVI ) , and that the General Committee was subjected every year to the same repetitious and wasteful debate on the subject , despite the universally accepted principle of respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of a Member State duly recognized as such by the United Nations . 
At the same time , the absence of an independent judiciary , coupled with a host of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct that prescribe enormously disproportionate penalties and authorize arrest and detention without judicial review or any other form of judicial authorization , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions in Myanmar are arbitrary when measured against generally accepted international standards .

The former idea developed by some analysts involves all States parties being subject initially to the same level of verification ; after time , however , as the international verification organization becomes confident in its knowledge of the relevant facilities and activities within a State party , it might be possible to reduce the number of regular inspections and begin relying on more infrequent but more intrusive inspections , provided the host State party accepted .  
Recalling also that , in its resolution 40 / 61 of 9 December 1985 , the General Assembly stated that it was mindful of the necessity of maintaining and safeguarding the basic rights of the individual in accordance with the relevant human rights instruments and generally accepted international standards ,  
A sound peace agreement that is generally accepted by the parties as a fair and just compromise respecting basic human ( political and economic ) rights is the best basis for subsequent efforts to disarm , demobilize and reintegrate combatants .  
In addition to natural capital , physical or produced capital , and to the now widely accepted notion of human capital , social capital refers to the functioning of the various institutions that are critical to individual welfare and social integration .

The question arises , with growing urgency , as to whether any juridical legitimacy that could , arguably , have been derived from past acquiescence in the assumption of power by the Military Forces can any longer provide a defensible basis for the continued maintenance of a non-constitutional system based on the assumption of martial powers , having such an unfavourable impact on human rights in the context of generally accepted international norms and the obligations undertaken by Myanmar .  
At the same time , the absence of an independent judiciary , coupled with a host of executive orders criminalizing far too many aspects of normal civilian conduct , prescribing enormously disproportionate penalties and authorizing arrest and detention without judicial review or any other form of judicial authorization , leads the Special Rapporteur to conclude that a significant percentage of all arrests and detentions in Myanmar are arbitrary when measured by generally accepted international standards .  
The commonly accepted definition of a standard is the result of well-reasoned collective choice designed to serve as the basis of understanding for the solution of recurring problems ; a standard represents a balance between the requirements of users and workers and between the technological and social possibilities of these two groups and the public interest which the authorities must safeguard .
