The central bank has introduced a number of policies recently .  The comprehensive utilization of various monetary policies is identical to the aforementioned " slow braking " currently required for macroeconomic regulation .  
The analysis of the State Statistical Bureau shows , last year , there were still certain problems during the industrial economy operation , for instance , capital defaults increased , deficits were still serious , fundamental products such as energy resources , raw materials , etc . grew at low rates , the transfer of industrial structure was considerably slow , and all these are restraining factors assailing the further healthy development of an industrial economy .  
Zeng Peiyan said : Of course , there are also problems accompanying our advance and development , the major ones being the insufficient effective demand , slowing growth in fixed assets investment , irrational economic structure , production and operational difficulties of some state-owned enterprises [ SOE 's ] , growing employment pressure , and slow growth of peasants ' income .  
Over the past 20 years since the founding of the Shenzhen SEZ , we have all along adhered to the principle that " development is the last word , " always kept in mind Deng Xiaoping 's thinking that " poverty is not socialism , development at an overly slow speed is not socialism either ; the superiority of socialism should ultimately be embodied in the better development of productive forces " and , closely centering on the economic construction , achieved the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Owing to the slow growth of peasants ' income , the problem of peasants ' burdens is ever more conspicuous .  The work of reducing burdens and increasing income should be done simultaneously , experiments of reforming rural taxes and charges should be properly made , and the work of supervising and managing peasants ' burdens should be performed in real earnest .  The situation of implementing various rules and regulations formulated by the central authorities should be inspected , and all sorts of erroneous practices to increase peasants ' burdens in disguised forms should be resolutely rectified .  
We are , and will remain for a long time , in the primary stage of socialism , and the most prominent characteristic of this stage is the slow development of our productive forces .  The contradiction between the masses ' ever growing material and cultural needs and the backward social output will always be our main social contradiction .  
People have come to see that as a regional vehicle for promoting an open trade and an economic and technological cooperation , APEC has been moving at an extremely slow pace in exercising its latter function , and is now unable to meet the economic development needs of its member states in this aspect ; as for its former function , due to an unduly fast speed in the past , APEC has now found it difficult to take another step forward .  
However , we should clearly understand that we are still in the early stages of a socialist society .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by vast space , a large population , a weak economic base and slow economic and cultural development .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by a dominating social contradiction expressed as a gap between social productivity and the increasing material and cultural demands of the populace , as well as a huge economic , scientific and technological gap with developed countries .  
While we pay attention to what we have achieved in construction of rural markets , we must also pay attention to the fact that the level of our rural markets is still low and they face such issues as unsound market systems and mechanisms , backward market infrastructures , slow development in the key elements of the market , low degrees of exports , depressed market prices , and low percentages of marketable commodities .  
Quite a large number of cadres lack sufficient understanding of the current new situation and tasks in agricultural and rural economic development ; they are relatively slow to change their concepts , and are rather lacking in knowledge of market economy and agricultural science and technology ; they lack strong capability and methods for leading the peasant masses to carry out restructuring and develop the economy , and do not sufficiently play their role as leaders ;  
The western region 's economic development has been relatively slow ; the condition of its social base is poor , and the strategic logistical facilities have always been a weak link and have never been able to meet the new demands of military combats .  
Since the beginning of the second half of 2000 , the economies of some APEC developed members have undergone major readjustments ; economic growth has remarkably slowed down ; the demand of the global information technology and electronic industry has been sluggish , and the financial market unstable ; export has begun to slow down ; and trade protectionism has raised its head .  These trends will bring about some uncertainties to APEC economic cooperation .  
P'an Chia-yu , instructor of Taiwan 's " Armed Forces University " , pointed out : If the PLA adopts the sudden attack strategy against Taiwan , the United States can respond only with its current cambat capability .  Without long-ranch fighters and forward bases , the United States has very limited capability to counter the PLA 's attack on Taiwan . In a modern war that emphasizes quick decision , US rescue to Taiwan would be too slow to meet the urgent need when the PLA launches an attack on Taiwan .  
It was learned that the Beijing hierarchy believes that though potential of domestic demand remains optimistic , owing to a host of adverse factors that hamper domestic demand , the country still faces a rigorous situation in this regard .  For instance , domestic consumption is still being restricted by a slow increase in income , and a widening gap in income as well .  
They should put aside their haughty manner , ignore hardship , go deep with great enthusiasm to rural areas having many difficulties and problems where economic development has been slow and local people have lived in poverty .  They should stay at peasants ' home for a few days to experience the masses ' difficulties and hardships , to understand their aspirations and needs , listen to their voices and opinions , and help them find the answers to some practical problems .  They should be faithful representatives of the masses .  
In recent years , the supply of major farm products in our country , which had fallen short of demand for a long time , has outstripped the demand .  Agricultural production in the past was aimed mainly at increasing output so as to solve the problem of food and clothing , and arising from such a pattern of agricultural production are problems of an irrational agricultural structure and product quality failing to meet market demand .  Such problems have caused the difficulty in marketing agricultural products , declining prices , and peasants ' slow income growth .  
The growth rate of investment in capital construction was small in the first half of the year , and no effective forms were adopted to stimulate investment by people in society .  So the growth of such investment was slow , which has not only directly affected the fulfillment of the expected objective for annual investment in fixed assets but expanded the extent of dependence of economic growth on government loans and state investment ;  
Members of the CPC Financial and Economic Committee held : Investments by non-state economic sectors have become an important force for pushing our country 's economic growth forward .  In the first half of the year , the growth of investment by urban and rural collectives and by individual persons picked up to some extent , but the speed was still rather slow .  
We should take practical and effective measures to fully arouse the enthusiasm of state-owned , collectively owned , and private enterprises and individual persons for investment , support the healthy development of medium and small enterprises , and change the situation in which the growth of investment by society is slow .  
To deal with such conspicuous problems as insufficient domestic demand , intensified export competition , greater unemployment pressure , irrational economic structure , and slow increase in peasants ' income , as well as the challenge of the Southeast Asian financial crisis , the Chinese government has adopted a correct policy of increasing government investment to boost domestic demand and promote economic growth .  
The earlier we understand the economic structure problem and make structural readjustment , the earlier we will have the initiative in our hands .  If we are late in knowing the problem and slow in solving it , we will land ourselves in a passive position .  
On the one hand , China 's agricultural and rural economy has entered a new stage , as agricultural development has changed from the restriction by resources in the past to the dual restriction by resources and markets ; the problems of irrational agricultural and rural economic structure , low agricultural comprehensive effectiveness , slow growth of peasants ' income , and so on are increasingly conspicuous , which have set new and higher demands on agricultural scientific and technological development .  
From an international viewpoint , after a country 's GDP has increased to a certain level , it usually will slow down its economic growth to ensure stable and coordinated economic and social development .  
He pointed out : Generally speaking , the living conditions of the people in our country have been greatly improved and have reached the level of being comparatively well-off .  However , due to various factors , the living conditions of the masses in some areas have been improved at a relatively slow speed , a small number of people among urban and rural residents are still facing more difficulties in their livelihood .  Some people even find it hard to get sufficient food .  
CPPCC committee member Li Guozhang said : The forming of a benign investment environment in the western part of the country is subject to restraints in six aspects , namely , the institutional restraints , the policy restraints , the restraints from the backward conditions of science , technology , and education , the restraints from the slow advance of the economic restructuring , the restraints from the out-of-date ideas , and the restraints from the transformation of the government functions .  
It is reported that the Social Welfare Department has cut the number of new recruits due to a slow down in the growth of social welfare spending this year , and this has resulted in a number of social service programmes failing to meet the set targets .  Meanwhile , among more than 900 fresh graduates of full-time degree and diploma courses in social work , 70 per cent are still unable to obtain employment .  
Meanwhile , local credit demand continued to be subdued , with loans for trade financing falling by 1.2 % and other loans rising by a meagre 0.1% , as domestic economic activity remained slow .  
" Upon completing the trial , TD found that most of the motorists would slow down when approaching the road markings .  " We have also received positive feedback from the public that the 50 km / h speed limit road marking is effective and should be extended to other suitable locations in the territory , " the spokesman said .  
Noting that the IMF has ranked Hong Kong as the region 's leader in good corporate governance and that Hong Kong has a pretty good record of enforcement , Mr Ma said nevertheless , problems precipitated by the economic slow down had focused the community on what was and was not acceptable behaviour on the part of market participants and their professional advisers .  
The wide and fertile western plain , with its dense population , heavy concentration of industry and convenient communications , has been developed rapidly in the past 30 years . Facing the Pacific Ocean on one side and backed by steep mountain ranges on the other , the East coast is isolated , sparsely populated and has little industry . This slow progress has been due to a large extent to the lack of a direct , rapid and reliable communications link .  
As society has advanced , we have become more industrialized and urbanized . One consequence is that life has become more rushed , more hectic ; a slow , relaxing meal has become a luxury and " fast foods " have become all too common . In this " fast food society " , processed foods have gradually become a housewife 's best friend ; canned foods , frozen foods , and T . V . dinners are now found in almost every kitchen .  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
To maintain economic growth , Taiwan must spur its domestic demand , although a large increase over a short time will not be easy . In addition , the growing incidence of demonstrations brought on by the democracy movement , the spread of influence by interest groups on the legislative process , and the growth of environmental consciousness mean that business must pay higher social costs , higher costs which will slow down Taiwan 's economic growth .  
Good social welfare systems offer lifetime security , and geographical remoteness has spared people fierce economic competition from other countries of the world . As a result , Australians and New Zealanders are leisurely and carefree , but their economic growth has been rather slow . Their leading exports are still agricultural and mining products , and they rely on imports for most industrial and manufactured products .  
This is especially true for mid-level officials , who do n't get so much ' value-added ' - - chauffeured automobiles , high social status , power , a sense of accomplishment - - as high level officials . On the contrary , they have complex duties , low pay , and slow advancement . It is easy for business to steal away these mid-level officials who have vast administrative experience , " says one civil servant . In recent years , the turnover rate for this type of person has been quite high .  
From the melody one can understand the wisdom of life and the changes of the track . Bodies warming up on the turf are like adagio - - slow but ordered . Starting from the blocks is like the first beat - - after a violent burst of energy , one needs gentle fluidity . The contradictions of the heart and the great difficulty of interval training are like variations - - only by charging through the most difficult sections can one get to the gentle and beautiful coda .  
By myself now at the mountain 's heart , I sat quietly , feeling my pulse gradually slow until it faded into inaudibility . A susurrant mountain breeze sprang up to accompany the insects I heard chirping from their hiding places underneath the soil and in the trees . I wondered if there were any birds or beasts concealed in the branches or behind the trunks of the surrounding trees , spying upon me , a stranger in these parts . Occasionally , the forest 's disparate noises seemed to coalesce into a mournful yet sumptuous symphony .  
Poor grades are bad enough - - what they 're even more worried about is that their darling little child , having fallen in with a " mixed crowd " back in the slow learner class , will be led astray on a short path to nowhere : no higher schooling , no steady employment and a life of idleness , dillydallying and shiftlessness . . . .  
The grasslands also arouse the imagination . When one stands among the grass , looking in all four directions at once , the great earth appears to be a green , round plate without boundaries , a plate pacific and changeless . Occasionally , a lonely , slow song wafts by , and in that voice can be heard the longing for the colorful world beyond the horizon . However difficult it was to bear , the foreign arrivals had to depart the grasslands once again .  
In the dark , researchers can only remain inland , observing the seashore at a long distance , watching the turtles crawl ashore like huge ambulant rocks . The green turtles dig their holes in slow motion , and concentrate on laying eggs . Only at this stage , when nothing will distract their attention , can researchers take advantage of this time to take measurements of the sea turtles and the length and width of the hole , make labels and establish a basic data base .  
Once I helped people pass out leaflets , but my boss got mad at me because I was slow , and I left . I went to a boxed lunch shop and helped them carry the boxed lunches , but it was too tiring . After a week , I did n't go back . Then I worked at my brother 's friend 's travel agency answering phones for two months .  
" Actually , calligraphy is a kind of exercise that fluctuates between fast and slow , relaxed and tense , light and heavy , lifting and pressing . When you wield the brush , you must direct your qi to have a good effect .  
The biggest reason was because I only had one set of ears , and I could only " switch channels " at a very slow rate . When I heard English spoken with all sorts of accents from various places , they often seemed completely unintelligible . I could accept it when I could n't manage to chat with people , but sometimes I could n't even take care of important matters , because I only comprehended half of what I was hearing .  
Before they even landed in Taiwan , Weidenhofer and Payne , who work for Artlab Australia , Down Under 's biggest restoration center , had already conducted tests on fragments Pottman had brought them , determining the composition of the paints used in the mural and finding suitable detergents . Still , they were very careful here , spending two weeks to repair just one wall of murals . In comparison to the water and soap that temples in Taiwan frequently use to clean their murals , this sort of slow and painstaking approach is extraordinary .  
In the future , cargo vessels from the two sides need not pass through a third country to transship freight , cutting shipping costs by nearly half and allowing more precise control over transportation times . With this change , Kaohsiung Harbor , which in recent years has seen slow growth in cargo tonnage , is expected to see an annual increase of 200,000 standard containers pass through it .  
When she had a big gash knocked in the back of her head , with her blood gushing out , the world moving in slow motion and the suddenly amplified sound of her heartbeat and breathing ringing in her ears , she did n't want go to a hospital because to save money she had n't bought health insurance . Meanwhile her friends were trying to staunch her bleeding while at the same time shaking her and shouting at her for all they were worth so as not to let her pass out . . . .  
In the creation story of Pangu , which deeply influenced the early Chinese , the universe is egg-shaped , and as Pangu incubates within it for 18,000 years , the light , transparent material floats slowly upwards to form the heavens , while the heavy , opaque material sinks downwards to become the earth . By this slow process , heaven and earth are born . Whether Pangu finally died or-as another version has it-just fell asleep , there was no other universe outside his .  
On the question of KPS setting up its own channel , Father Raymond Parent notes that when he was a member of the Government Information Office 's nine-member research team on cable television , he felt that the remit set by the GIO was too narrow , and the pace of legal reform too slow . With the chaotic situation of the time , when all cable channels were illegal , it would have been very difficult for KPS , with its limited financial resources , to enter this market .  
With its emphasis on " developing qi to relax the body , " and its loose , supple , slow physicality , taijiquan is a contrast to the usual types of exercise favored by today 's well-fed , sedentary city slickers with their hectic lifestyles-activities such as jogging , gym workouts , and aerobics , which contract the muscles and quicken the pulse .  
Over 70% of Tungshih 's population is of Hakka ancestry , and both civic organizations and ordinary people have preserved large numbers of Hakka artifacts and much historical material . After the earthquake , the Taichung County Hakka Cultural Association realized that these valuable cultural and historical assets might be destroyed by the bulldozers as damaged houses were demolished . They urged the Tungshih Township authorities to slow down the demolition work , to give them a few days ' time to save what they could .  
In Wang 's view , before Lee Teng-hui took over , the KMT was preoccupied with both the external threat and the many demands of domestic reconstruction , and while it held back the reins of power from local Taiwanese and was slow about democratization , it none the less managed , through caution and deliberation , to secure Taiwan 's existence and develop the economy . Therefore , says Wang , " it deserved 80 out of 100 for its performance in government . "  
Putting the public interest first As for the " three links " ( direct cross-strait communications , transportation , and postal links ) and the " go slow " approach that has guided cross-strait policy in recent years , Tsai Ing-wen says , " Right now cross-strait exchanges far outweigh the three links . We can not relax our policy unconditionally , as we must first complete an assessment of national security , taking a look at policy risks and only then considering what procedures to follow in relaxing policy .  
In terms of ideology , the stress on the ideal of a unified Greater China and institutionalized anti-communism threw a pall over local culture , and a Taiwan-oriented consciousness had not yet openly emerged . The political environment and the distribution of cultural resources were less than fair , and due to the influence of a world-view centered on the Chinese mainland , progress on urban rapid transit systems and many other important basic infrastructure projects was slow .  
Consider the fact that it depends on the central government for less than 10% of its revenues , while the average for Taiwan 's local governments as a whole stands at about 50% . Taipei City can almost make ends meet through its own tax revenues , but other cities are heavily reliant on the central government , and they are trapped in a vicious cycle in which slow economic development makes it difficult for them to broaden their tax base no matter hard they try .  
His 1944 painting On the Way Home shows an old water buffalo , drawn with such precision that you can see its individual hairs . Leading it home is an old farming woman , who is carrying a bundle of sugar cane and wearing leggings and a broad rimmed hat with a covering scarf knotted under her chin . The simple and rustic scene does a good job of conveying Taiwan 's slow pace of life in those days .  
According to Wu Tse-jui from Meishan , preparing Mt . Ali tea for the market involves precise planting , careful selection , gentle rolling , and slow baking , especially for unfermented green tea .  
Chen says that in Guangdong , where strict quarantine measures have not been taken and public health resources are inadequate , the epidemic has apparently begun to naturally slow down on its own . Does this mean that most people have been mildly infected and their bodies have produced antibodies , so that the virus can not find any " fresh " victims without natural defenses , and therefore is retiring from the field ?  
Unlike most temples , which have employed tile and concrete for a speedy reconstruction , the Paoan Temple used good materials and hired skilled artisans . A grade-two historical site , the temple was restored in a slow and careful manner .  
Sunlight streams in through the flowering cherry trees in the garden and falls on a bare wooden table , where a sprig of pinstripe ginger rests in elegant simplicity on a bamboo mat , compelling time to slow its forward march for a moment .  
But even if he was often scatterbrained and had a dull look in his eyes off the field , he was extraordinary when he took the mound , almost never disappointing Coach Huang . With a 145-km / h fastball coming off his hand , a slow breaking ball that cut a huge arc on its way to the plate , and a tricky slider , hitters on the opposing teams could see Wu 's pitches dance their way to the plate , but one after another they failed to get a bat on the ball .  
Biomechanical imbalances can be corrected and a comfortable gait achieved by inserting an arch or spacer in the shoe . The second group have lost the feeling in their feet due to nerve damage , so that they may be injured without realizing it if they bump into things , making them very prone to infection . This group has grown substantially in recent years . Diabetics are particularly difficult to deal with , because their wounds are slow to heal .  
despite all these favorable factors , however , germany 's economic recovery will be weak and slow this is because the country 's labor cost is still high , its social welfare burdens are heavy , and the recovery in other major western economies still lacks steam  
Despite the presence of rich natural resources , Africa 's chief attraction , the continent 's slow economic growth , which remains well below the average for all developing countries , offsets even this considerable advantage .  
In an environment of slow growth , lack of public and private resources , limited external assistance and constraints of technical , managerial and organizational capacity , the challenges in basic infrastructure are formidable .  
After the 1980s , which had been a lost decade for development , trends for the 1990s were not very encouraging : growing instability , uneven development , slow economic recovery and rising unemployment in the industrialized countries .  
CARICOM States are mindful that progress will be uneven sometimes slow and that the Government of Haiti will need sustained support by the international community to build the foundations for lasting peace and social and economic progress .  
The Conference on Disarmament has advanced towards the comprehensive test-ban treaty through sustained but slow efforts , and it has failed to begin negotiations on a convention prohibiting the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices .  
Sometimes this means that certain conflicts whose threat to international stability is not obvious swallow up considerable funds , with large contingents of peace-keeping forces being sent immediately , whereas in other instances we believe the Security Council is slow to act , sometimes taking months to study a situation and limiting itself in the final analysis to sending small groups of observers , despite the direct request made by the leaders of the States concerned .  
The most important symptoms reflecting insufficient capacity include the slow pace of policy and institutional reform ; weak intersectoral coordination ; the non-adoption of forestry programmes as priorities at the highest political levels ; the lack of clearly defined priorities ; and a continuing over-reliance on external technical assistance .  
There is far less enthusiasm now for sudden sharp changes in policies ( shock therapy ) than for slow , piecemeal and gradual changes in the light of the more stable and rapid growth in the centrally planned economies in Asia in contrast to disruptions and slow recovery of those in Europe , where changes were complete and sharp .  
Despite differences or variances in legal systems , there was general agreement that extant laws governing administrative systems are too many and are redundant ; enforcement is slow , and some laws simply can not be implemented for a variety of reasons : lack of resources , operational or resource constraints , irrelevance or inapplicability of prevailing conditions .  
Expresses deep concern at the slow pace of quartering and disarming UNITA troops , notes the public commitment by UNITA to quarter its troops in an expeditious and comprehensive fashion and reiterates its conviction that the quartering of UNITA forces , as the first step in its transformation to a legitimate political party , is a crucial component of the peace process ;  
Expresses deep concern at the slow pace of quartering and disarming UNITA troops , notes the public commitment by UNITA to quarter its troops in an expeditious and comprehensive fashion and reiterates its conviction that the quartering of UNITA forces , as the first step in its transformation to a legitimate political party , is a crucial component of the peace process ;  
During the 1980s , improvement efforts of all types in developing countries were disrupted by economic crises , most notably external debt crises and rising debt burdens , depressed commodity prices , slow growth of output and inadequate mobilization of domestic resources .  
Scientific journals and publications dealing with technological innovation and research are slow to reach Libya , especially publications issued by specialized international organizations and agencies that are active in disseminating information and technical data relating to the spread of plant and animal diseases and epidemics in various parts of the world .  
We must note with deep concern the delays , particularly in the areas of the quartering of UNITA troops ; the selection of soldiers for incorporation into the Angolan Armed Forces ( FAA ) ; and the slow process of the transfer of UNITA commanding officers to join the FAA , as well as the handing over to UNAVEM III of insufficient quantities of weapons and the poor quality of those handed over , and the continued presence of UNITA police .  
The international economy was displaying mixed characteristics : in the case of the developed countries , there were prospects of continued cyclical expansion , but there were also fears of inflation and resulting suggestions to contain growth rates , and there was increased unemployment and slow progress in the structural transformation of economies ; in the case of the developing countries , there were significant growth rates and a greater contribution to world trade , but also problems of poverty , lack of infrastructure , human resources and technological strength .  
However , in spite of donor support and encouragement , progress has been slow in most of these areas for two main reasons : lack of human and financial capacity to manage such complex reforms ; and political sensitivity , which call for broad consultations and negotiations involving Parliament and civil society , thereby further contributing to the complexity of the reform process .  
However , despite commitments made , barriers remained because the developed countries were still tempted by protectionism , as shown by anti-dumping measures , countervailing duties , progressive increases in duties , slow liberalization of the agricultural and textile sectors and the recourse to unilateral measures outside the WTO dispute settlement system , which was crucial for the defence of the developing countries ' trade interests .  
The problems facing sub-Saharan Africa were manifold : foreign debt service , slow economic growth , inadequate social investment , drought and environmental degradation , the growing HIV / AIDS epidemic , political instability and armed conflict .  
Although the Department of Peacekeeping Operations had established a number of bodies to increase its effectiveness , acquired considerable experience in that area and carried out many studies , Mozambique was concerned to see that the Organization remained slow to respond to conflict situations and that it repeated errors which had been committed in past operations .  Cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations must be improved .  
After touching briefly on the issue of economic growth and some of the reasons for the continued slow growth of the world economy , he said that it was increasingly being recognized that private capital flows were not a viable long-term solution .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed concern that the Trade and Development Report 's forecast of slow world economic growth reflected the effects of the unequal access of developing countries to external lending and FDI .  
Although the level of resentment fluctuates , popular disappointment with the perceived slow pace of implementation of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , and , in particular , erratic food distribution , delays in the arrival of medicines and severe power cuts , continues to be voiced against the United Nations , and a growing number of beneficiaries decline to be interviewed .  
The already slow process of development in those countries would be further impeded , requiring three types of countermeasures : slowing of population growth , promotion of North-South partnership , such as that envisioned in Agenda 21 and the final documents of other major United Nations conferences , and the eradication of poverty through the creation of an international economic climate favourable to the opening up of markets , debt reduction and increased financial resources flows from North to South .  
But equality of rights is not yet reflected in everyday life , owing to the slow pace of sociological and political change , resistance from the controllers of capital , clashing economic interests and the resultant widespread violence .  
There has been relatively slow progress in developing a system for environmental and economic accounting ( SEEA ) at the national level , although current efforts in a number of countries indicate that the SEEA may gain increasing attention in the near future .  
It is also of concern that problems such as the slow and erratic pace at which humanitarian inputs arrive in Iraq , the operating difficulties of the distribution system , and the deteriorating basic infrastructure in the various key sectors responsible for providing social services continue to hamper the implementation process .  
Economic growth in eastern Europe averaged 4 per cent , less than in 1995 and generally less than expected ; in Russia the slump in output deepened rather than bottoming out ; the expected boost to activity resulting from the ending of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia has been slow to materialize ; there were major economic setbacks in Bulgaria and Romania ; and in Albania an economic crisis developed into a state of political and social chaos in which the Government lost control of large parts of the country .  
Although the measures introduced in 1995 to restore internal and external balance to the Hungarian economy have made considerable progress in this direction , their impact on domestic demand and especially on household consumption has been more severe and more long-lasting than expected .  Economic growth in Slovenia also continued to slow down in 1996 , despite earlier forecasts of an acceleration .  
In the light of the international community 's increasing awareness of slow economic growth in many developing countries and countries in transition from a centrally planned economy to a free-market economy ( transitional economy countries ) and of the related negative global implications , it is essential that the United Nations should promote and implement action-oriented responses aimed at helping those countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth . 
During the discussions on methods of implementing economic , social and cultural rights , an implementation that necessitates a certain level of economic development and material support , the representatives of several developing countries expressed the fear that the inevitably slow progress in realizing those rights might be taken for unwillingness on their part . 
A number of experts expressed concern at the slow and cumbersome procedures which continued to cause considerable delays in moving transit cargo out of the port and across national boundaries .  
The United States has certainly designed a blockade that , like a vile medieval garrotte , has managed with slow and pyrrhic success to bring about innumerable shortages to 11-million human beings and has greatly hampered the country 's normal development .  
The months ahead will be crucial to the consolidation of essential political , social and economic transformations , and it is to be hoped that the activities leading up to the presidential elections of November 1999 will not slow down or halt the process .  
No one can deny that the negative trends of these last decades of the twentieth century are slow to reverse .  These include growing poverty , the marginalization of hundreds of millions of people , the precarious state of natural resources , the degradation of biological diversity , the destruction of forests , worsening pollution , rampant desertification , and so many other examples .  
Concerning external debt , the agreed formulations on problems relating to debt workouts by countries hit by financial crisis and on the slow progress in the implementation of the World Bank / IMF HIPC initiative represented a significant advance in international consensus on the subject .  
However , with growth of output in Africa projected to slow to about 2 per cent in 1999 below the level of population growth this modest recovery is already being threatened by international financial crises , declining commodity prices and regional conflicts .  
All major gynaecological centres in the country report an increase in the number of pregnant women suffering from threatened abortion , premature deliveries , slow foetal growth , higher Caesarean section incidence , etc .  
The period under review was marked by continuing negotiations , interrupted by repeated discord , and slow progress between the political parties and the Government of Haiti on how to continue to provide essential Government services , such as police and customs services , and how to further the cause of democracy through the organization of legislative and municipal elections .  
The Yugoslav Government and public is concerned , in particular , over the slow and altogether inefficient investigation of daily crimes committed throughout the Province , the tolerant and protective attitude towards Albanian terrorists and criminal gangs , whereby they are encouraged to realize their plan of ethnic cleansing of all of the non-Albanian population .  
It is of considerable regret to us that some of the soldiers serving in Sierra Leone on behalf of the international community , the non-UNAMSIL ECOMOG contingents , will not be funded on this basis and will instead continue to rely on voluntary contributions , which have been desperately slow in coming and which are , at least on the basis of past practice , unlikely to relieve significantly the financial burden ECOMOG troop-contributors have assumed .  
It was even more concerned by the slow promotion and facilitation of self-government and by the fact that the utmost effort had not been made to ascertain the free and voluntary choice of the peoples on the political future of their Territories .  
Their joint negative impact on agricultural growth rates in the developing world is a major reason for the slow progress in rural development , and for rural poverty reduction over the last half century .  
Modern criminals long ago realized the true advantages of close international links , and they have not been slow to use them for their antisocial purposes , often keeping a few steps ahead of the forces of law and order .  
Inadequate budgetary allocations for the social sectors , slow disbursement of available funds , weak institutional and human resources capacities , and unreasonably low salary levels for civil servants are constraints common to all sectors .  
The Committee is concerned , further , that domestic law is not yet fully compatible with the provisions and principles of the Convention , that the process of drafting and adopting new legislation is slow and that , in addition , some customary practices which are prejudicial to childrens rights may still be applied instead of modern domestic legal provisions .  
The Committee remains deeply concerned at the weakness of family links , at the large numbers of children who have been deprived of a family environment and , in particular at reports regarding : difficulties and slow progress in tracing separated families and children ; the lack of adequate mechanisms of protection for children living in institutions ; the placement of children in institutions for long periods ; and the predominant use of placement in institutions in preference to the development of alternative care measures ( e.g . , adoption and foster care ) . 
Expresses serious concern over the slow pace of investigating alleged serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law committed by federal forces , federal servicemen and the personnel of law enforcement agencies against civilians and notes with concern that very few such cases have reached the judicial system ;  
In many cities , confronted with rapid growth , environmental problems and the slow pace of economic development , it has not been possible to generate sufficient employment , provide adequate housing and meet the basic needs of the citizens .  
The current political process might seem slow , but the sensitive nature of the issues involved and the far-reaching implications for the countrys future made it vitally important that the National Convention proceed slowly and systematically in order to safeguard the interests of all the national races and to avoid replicating the shortcomings of the two previous Constitutions .  
Since the 1990s , the society in Myanmar has been confronted by a slow and often painful pace of transition , with continuing unrest , political tensions , civil and political rights violations , a complex humanitarian situation and economic crisis .  
The central bank has introduced a number of policies recently .  The comprehensive utilization of various monetary policies is identical to the aforementioned " slow braking " currently required for macroeconomic regulation .  
The analysis of the State Statistical Bureau shows , last year , there were still certain problems during the industrial economy operation , for instance , capital defaults increased , deficits were still serious , fundamental products such as energy resources , raw materials , etc . grew at low rates , the transfer of industrial structure was considerably slow , and all these are restraining factors assailing the further healthy development of an industrial economy .  
Zeng Peiyan said : Of course , there are also problems accompanying our advance and development , the major ones being the insufficient effective demand , slowing growth in fixed assets investment , irrational economic structure , production and operational difficulties of some state-owned enterprises [ SOE 's ] , growing employment pressure , and slow growth of peasants ' income .  
Over the past 20 years since the founding of the Shenzhen SEZ , we have all along adhered to the principle that " development is the last word , " always kept in mind Deng Xiaoping 's thinking that " poverty is not socialism , development at an overly slow speed is not socialism either ; the superiority of socialism should ultimately be embodied in the better development of productive forces " and , closely centering on the economic construction , achieved the sustained , rapid , and healthy development of the national economy .  
Owing to the slow growth of peasants ' income , the problem of peasants ' burdens is ever more conspicuous .  The work of reducing burdens and increasing income should be done simultaneously , experiments of reforming rural taxes and charges should be properly made , and the work of supervising and managing peasants ' burdens should be performed in real earnest .  The situation of implementing various rules and regulations formulated by the central authorities should be inspected , and all sorts of erroneous practices to increase peasants ' burdens in disguised forms should be resolutely rectified .  
We are , and will remain for a long time , in the primary stage of socialism , and the most prominent characteristic of this stage is the slow development of our productive forces .  The contradiction between the masses ' ever growing material and cultural needs and the backward social output will always be our main social contradiction .  
People have come to see that as a regional vehicle for promoting an open trade and an economic and technological cooperation , APEC has been moving at an extremely slow pace in exercising its latter function , and is now unable to meet the economic development needs of its member states in this aspect ; as for its former function , due to an unduly fast speed in the past , APEC has now found it difficult to take another step forward .  
However , we should clearly understand that we are still in the early stages of a socialist society .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by vast space , a large population , a weak economic base and slow economic and cultural development .  We are still facing a basic national climate characterized by a dominating social contradiction expressed as a gap between social productivity and the increasing material and cultural demands of the populace , as well as a huge economic , scientific and technological gap with developed countries .  
While we pay attention to what we have achieved in construction of rural markets , we must also pay attention to the fact that the level of our rural markets is still low and they face such issues as unsound market systems and mechanisms , backward market infrastructures , slow development in the key elements of the market , low degrees of exports , depressed market prices , and low percentages of marketable commodities .  
Quite a large number of cadres lack sufficient understanding of the current new situation and tasks in agricultural and rural economic development ; they are relatively slow to change their concepts , and are rather lacking in knowledge of market economy and agricultural science and technology ; they lack strong capability and methods for leading the peasant masses to carry out restructuring and develop the economy , and do not sufficiently play their role as leaders ;  
The western region 's economic development has been relatively slow ; the condition of its social base is poor , and the strategic logistical facilities have always been a weak link and have never been able to meet the new demands of military combats .  
Since the beginning of the second half of 2000 , the economies of some APEC developed members have undergone major readjustments ; economic growth has remarkably slowed down ; the demand of the global information technology and electronic industry has been sluggish , and the financial market unstable ; export has begun to slow down ; and trade protectionism has raised its head .  These trends will bring about some uncertainties to APEC economic cooperation .  
P'an Chia-yu , instructor of Taiwan 's " Armed Forces University " , pointed out : If the PLA adopts the sudden attack strategy against Taiwan , the United States can respond only with its current cambat capability .  Without long-ranch fighters and forward bases , the United States has very limited capability to counter the PLA 's attack on Taiwan . In a modern war that emphasizes quick decision , US rescue to Taiwan would be too slow to meet the urgent need when the PLA launches an attack on Taiwan .  
It was learned that the Beijing hierarchy believes that though potential of domestic demand remains optimistic , owing to a host of adverse factors that hamper domestic demand , the country still faces a rigorous situation in this regard .  For instance , domestic consumption is still being restricted by a slow increase in income , and a widening gap in income as well .  
They should put aside their haughty manner , ignore hardship , go deep with great enthusiasm to rural areas having many difficulties and problems where economic development has been slow and local people have lived in poverty .  They should stay at peasants ' home for a few days to experience the masses ' difficulties and hardships , to understand their aspirations and needs , listen to their voices and opinions , and help them find the answers to some practical problems .  They should be faithful representatives of the masses .  
In recent years , the supply of major farm products in our country , which had fallen short of demand for a long time , has outstripped the demand .  Agricultural production in the past was aimed mainly at increasing output so as to solve the problem of food and clothing , and arising from such a pattern of agricultural production are problems of an irrational agricultural structure and product quality failing to meet market demand .  Such problems have caused the difficulty in marketing agricultural products , declining prices , and peasants ' slow income growth .  
The growth rate of investment in capital construction was small in the first half of the year , and no effective forms were adopted to stimulate investment by people in society .  So the growth of such investment was slow , which has not only directly affected the fulfillment of the expected objective for annual investment in fixed assets but expanded the extent of dependence of economic growth on government loans and state investment ;  
Members of the CPC Financial and Economic Committee held : Investments by non-state economic sectors have become an important force for pushing our country 's economic growth forward .  In the first half of the year , the growth of investment by urban and rural collectives and by individual persons picked up to some extent , but the speed was still rather slow .  
We should take practical and effective measures to fully arouse the enthusiasm of state-owned , collectively owned , and private enterprises and individual persons for investment , support the healthy development of medium and small enterprises , and change the situation in which the growth of investment by society is slow .  
To deal with such conspicuous problems as insufficient domestic demand , intensified export competition , greater unemployment pressure , irrational economic structure , and slow increase in peasants ' income , as well as the challenge of the Southeast Asian financial crisis , the Chinese government has adopted a correct policy of increasing government investment to boost domestic demand and promote economic growth .  
The earlier we understand the economic structure problem and make structural readjustment , the earlier we will have the initiative in our hands .  If we are late in knowing the problem and slow in solving it , we will land ourselves in a passive position .  
On the one hand , China 's agricultural and rural economy has entered a new stage , as agricultural development has changed from the restriction by resources in the past to the dual restriction by resources and markets ; the problems of irrational agricultural and rural economic structure , low agricultural comprehensive effectiveness , slow growth of peasants ' income , and so on are increasingly conspicuous , which have set new and higher demands on agricultural scientific and technological development .  
From an international viewpoint , after a country 's GDP has increased to a certain level , it usually will slow down its economic growth to ensure stable and coordinated economic and social development .  
He pointed out : Generally speaking , the living conditions of the people in our country have been greatly improved and have reached the level of being comparatively well-off .  However , due to various factors , the living conditions of the masses in some areas have been improved at a relatively slow speed , a small number of people among urban and rural residents are still facing more difficulties in their livelihood .  Some people even find it hard to get sufficient food .  
CPPCC committee member Li Guozhang said : The forming of a benign investment environment in the western part of the country is subject to restraints in six aspects , namely , the institutional restraints , the policy restraints , the restraints from the backward conditions of science , technology , and education , the restraints from the slow advance of the economic restructuring , the restraints from the out-of-date ideas , and the restraints from the transformation of the government functions .  
It is reported that the Social Welfare Department has cut the number of new recruits due to a slow down in the growth of social welfare spending this year , and this has resulted in a number of social service programmes failing to meet the set targets .  Meanwhile , among more than 900 fresh graduates of full-time degree and diploma courses in social work , 70 per cent are still unable to obtain employment .  
Meanwhile , local credit demand continued to be subdued , with loans for trade financing falling by 1.2 % and other loans rising by a meagre 0.1% , as domestic economic activity remained slow .  
" Upon completing the trial , TD found that most of the motorists would slow down when approaching the road markings .  " We have also received positive feedback from the public that the 50 km / h speed limit road marking is effective and should be extended to other suitable locations in the territory , " the spokesman said .  
Noting that the IMF has ranked Hong Kong as the region 's leader in good corporate governance and that Hong Kong has a pretty good record of enforcement , Mr Ma said nevertheless , problems precipitated by the economic slow down had focused the community on what was and was not acceptable behaviour on the part of market participants and their professional advisers .  
The wide and fertile western plain , with its dense population , heavy concentration of industry and convenient communications , has been developed rapidly in the past 30 years . Facing the Pacific Ocean on one side and backed by steep mountain ranges on the other , the East coast is isolated , sparsely populated and has little industry . This slow progress has been due to a large extent to the lack of a direct , rapid and reliable communications link .  
As society has advanced , we have become more industrialized and urbanized . One consequence is that life has become more rushed , more hectic ; a slow , relaxing meal has become a luxury and " fast foods " have become all too common . In this " fast food society " , processed foods have gradually become a housewife 's best friend ; canned foods , frozen foods , and T . V . dinners are now found in almost every kitchen .  
Unless we further accelerate the training of technical personnel , it will be difficult for us to join the ranks of the industrialized nations . 4 ) Sluggish renovation of technology by private enterprise . The most fundamental reason why the nation 's industrial structure is weak and its speed of adjustment is slow is that the level of creativity in products and production processes is inadequate and technological renovation by private enterprise is sluggish .  
To maintain economic growth , Taiwan must spur its domestic demand , although a large increase over a short time will not be easy . In addition , the growing incidence of demonstrations brought on by the democracy movement , the spread of influence by interest groups on the legislative process , and the growth of environmental consciousness mean that business must pay higher social costs , higher costs which will slow down Taiwan 's economic growth .  
Good social welfare systems offer lifetime security , and geographical remoteness has spared people fierce economic competition from other countries of the world . As a result , Australians and New Zealanders are leisurely and carefree , but their economic growth has been rather slow . Their leading exports are still agricultural and mining products , and they rely on imports for most industrial and manufactured products .  
This is especially true for mid-level officials , who do n't get so much ' value-added ' - - chauffeured automobiles , high social status , power , a sense of accomplishment - - as high level officials . On the contrary , they have complex duties , low pay , and slow advancement . It is easy for business to steal away these mid-level officials who have vast administrative experience , " says one civil servant . In recent years , the turnover rate for this type of person has been quite high .  
From the melody one can understand the wisdom of life and the changes of the track . Bodies warming up on the turf are like adagio - - slow but ordered . Starting from the blocks is like the first beat - - after a violent burst of energy , one needs gentle fluidity . The contradictions of the heart and the great difficulty of interval training are like variations - - only by charging through the most difficult sections can one get to the gentle and beautiful coda .  
By myself now at the mountain 's heart , I sat quietly , feeling my pulse gradually slow until it faded into inaudibility . A susurrant mountain breeze sprang up to accompany the insects I heard chirping from their hiding places underneath the soil and in the trees . I wondered if there were any birds or beasts concealed in the branches or behind the trunks of the surrounding trees , spying upon me , a stranger in these parts . Occasionally , the forest 's disparate noises seemed to coalesce into a mournful yet sumptuous symphony .  
Poor grades are bad enough - - what they 're even more worried about is that their darling little child , having fallen in with a " mixed crowd " back in the slow learner class , will be led astray on a short path to nowhere : no higher schooling , no steady employment and a life of idleness , dillydallying and shiftlessness . . . .  
The grasslands also arouse the imagination . When one stands among the grass , looking in all four directions at once , the great earth appears to be a green , round plate without boundaries , a plate pacific and changeless . Occasionally , a lonely , slow song wafts by , and in that voice can be heard the longing for the colorful world beyond the horizon . However difficult it was to bear , the foreign arrivals had to depart the grasslands once again .  
In the dark , researchers can only remain inland , observing the seashore at a long distance , watching the turtles crawl ashore like huge ambulant rocks . The green turtles dig their holes in slow motion , and concentrate on laying eggs . Only at this stage , when nothing will distract their attention , can researchers take advantage of this time to take measurements of the sea turtles and the length and width of the hole , make labels and establish a basic data base .  
Once I helped people pass out leaflets , but my boss got mad at me because I was slow , and I left . I went to a boxed lunch shop and helped them carry the boxed lunches , but it was too tiring . After a week , I did n't go back . Then I worked at my brother 's friend 's travel agency answering phones for two months .  
" Actually , calligraphy is a kind of exercise that fluctuates between fast and slow , relaxed and tense , light and heavy , lifting and pressing . When you wield the brush , you must direct your qi to have a good effect .  
The biggest reason was because I only had one set of ears , and I could only " switch channels " at a very slow rate . When I heard English spoken with all sorts of accents from various places , they often seemed completely unintelligible . I could accept it when I could n't manage to chat with people , but sometimes I could n't even take care of important matters , because I only comprehended half of what I was hearing .  
Before they even landed in Taiwan , Weidenhofer and Payne , who work for Artlab Australia , Down Under 's biggest restoration center , had already conducted tests on fragments Pottman had brought them , determining the composition of the paints used in the mural and finding suitable detergents . Still , they were very careful here , spending two weeks to repair just one wall of murals . In comparison to the water and soap that temples in Taiwan frequently use to clean their murals , this sort of slow and painstaking approach is extraordinary .  
In the future , cargo vessels from the two sides need not pass through a third country to transship freight , cutting shipping costs by nearly half and allowing more precise control over transportation times . With this change , Kaohsiung Harbor , which in recent years has seen slow growth in cargo tonnage , is expected to see an annual increase of 200,000 standard containers pass through it .  
When she had a big gash knocked in the back of her head , with her blood gushing out , the world moving in slow motion and the suddenly amplified sound of her heartbeat and breathing ringing in her ears , she did n't want go to a hospital because to save money she had n't bought health insurance . Meanwhile her friends were trying to staunch her bleeding while at the same time shaking her and shouting at her for all they were worth so as not to let her pass out . . . .  
In the creation story of Pangu , which deeply influenced the early Chinese , the universe is egg-shaped , and as Pangu incubates within it for 18,000 years , the light , transparent material floats slowly upwards to form the heavens , while the heavy , opaque material sinks downwards to become the earth . By this slow process , heaven and earth are born . Whether Pangu finally died or-as another version has it-just fell asleep , there was no other universe outside his .  
On the question of KPS setting up its own channel , Father Raymond Parent notes that when he was a member of the Government Information Office 's nine-member research team on cable television , he felt that the remit set by the GIO was too narrow , and the pace of legal reform too slow . With the chaotic situation of the time , when all cable channels were illegal , it would have been very difficult for KPS , with its limited financial resources , to enter this market .  
With its emphasis on " developing qi to relax the body , " and its loose , supple , slow physicality , taijiquan is a contrast to the usual types of exercise favored by today 's well-fed , sedentary city slickers with their hectic lifestyles-activities such as jogging , gym workouts , and aerobics , which contract the muscles and quicken the pulse .  
Over 70% of Tungshih 's population is of Hakka ancestry , and both civic organizations and ordinary people have preserved large numbers of Hakka artifacts and much historical material . After the earthquake , the Taichung County Hakka Cultural Association realized that these valuable cultural and historical assets might be destroyed by the bulldozers as damaged houses were demolished . They urged the Tungshih Township authorities to slow down the demolition work , to give them a few days ' time to save what they could .  
In Wang 's view , before Lee Teng-hui took over , the KMT was preoccupied with both the external threat and the many demands of domestic reconstruction , and while it held back the reins of power from local Taiwanese and was slow about democratization , it none the less managed , through caution and deliberation , to secure Taiwan 's existence and develop the economy . Therefore , says Wang , " it deserved 80 out of 100 for its performance in government . "  
Putting the public interest first As for the " three links " ( direct cross-strait communications , transportation , and postal links ) and the " go slow " approach that has guided cross-strait policy in recent years , Tsai Ing-wen says , " Right now cross-strait exchanges far outweigh the three links . We can not relax our policy unconditionally , as we must first complete an assessment of national security , taking a look at policy risks and only then considering what procedures to follow in relaxing policy .  
In terms of ideology , the stress on the ideal of a unified Greater China and institutionalized anti-communism threw a pall over local culture , and a Taiwan-oriented consciousness had not yet openly emerged . The political environment and the distribution of cultural resources were less than fair , and due to the influence of a world-view centered on the Chinese mainland , progress on urban rapid transit systems and many other important basic infrastructure projects was slow .  
Consider the fact that it depends on the central government for less than 10% of its revenues , while the average for Taiwan 's local governments as a whole stands at about 50% . Taipei City can almost make ends meet through its own tax revenues , but other cities are heavily reliant on the central government , and they are trapped in a vicious cycle in which slow economic development makes it difficult for them to broaden their tax base no matter hard they try .  
His 1944 painting On the Way Home shows an old water buffalo , drawn with such precision that you can see its individual hairs . Leading it home is an old farming woman , who is carrying a bundle of sugar cane and wearing leggings and a broad rimmed hat with a covering scarf knotted under her chin . The simple and rustic scene does a good job of conveying Taiwan 's slow pace of life in those days .  
According to Wu Tse-jui from Meishan , preparing Mt . Ali tea for the market involves precise planting , careful selection , gentle rolling , and slow baking , especially for unfermented green tea .  
Chen says that in Guangdong , where strict quarantine measures have not been taken and public health resources are inadequate , the epidemic has apparently begun to naturally slow down on its own . Does this mean that most people have been mildly infected and their bodies have produced antibodies , so that the virus can not find any " fresh " victims without natural defenses , and therefore is retiring from the field ?  
Unlike most temples , which have employed tile and concrete for a speedy reconstruction , the Paoan Temple used good materials and hired skilled artisans . A grade-two historical site , the temple was restored in a slow and careful manner .  
Sunlight streams in through the flowering cherry trees in the garden and falls on a bare wooden table , where a sprig of pinstripe ginger rests in elegant simplicity on a bamboo mat , compelling time to slow its forward march for a moment .  
But even if he was often scatterbrained and had a dull look in his eyes off the field , he was extraordinary when he took the mound , almost never disappointing Coach Huang . With a 145-km / h fastball coming off his hand , a slow breaking ball that cut a huge arc on its way to the plate , and a tricky slider , hitters on the opposing teams could see Wu 's pitches dance their way to the plate , but one after another they failed to get a bat on the ball .  
Biomechanical imbalances can be corrected and a comfortable gait achieved by inserting an arch or spacer in the shoe . The second group have lost the feeling in their feet due to nerve damage , so that they may be injured without realizing it if they bump into things , making them very prone to infection . This group has grown substantially in recent years . Diabetics are particularly difficult to deal with , because their wounds are slow to heal .  
despite all these favorable factors , however , germany 's economic recovery will be weak and slow this is because the country 's labor cost is still high , its social welfare burdens are heavy , and the recovery in other major western economies still lacks steam  
Despite the presence of rich natural resources , Africa 's chief attraction , the continent 's slow economic growth , which remains well below the average for all developing countries , offsets even this considerable advantage .  
In an environment of slow growth , lack of public and private resources , limited external assistance and constraints of technical , managerial and organizational capacity , the challenges in basic infrastructure are formidable .  
After the 1980s , which had been a lost decade for development , trends for the 1990s were not very encouraging : growing instability , uneven development , slow economic recovery and rising unemployment in the industrialized countries .  
CARICOM States are mindful that progress will be uneven sometimes slow and that the Government of Haiti will need sustained support by the international community to build the foundations for lasting peace and social and economic progress .  
The Conference on Disarmament has advanced towards the comprehensive test-ban treaty through sustained but slow efforts , and it has failed to begin negotiations on a convention prohibiting the production of fissionable material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices .  
Sometimes this means that certain conflicts whose threat to international stability is not obvious swallow up considerable funds , with large contingents of peace-keeping forces being sent immediately , whereas in other instances we believe the Security Council is slow to act , sometimes taking months to study a situation and limiting itself in the final analysis to sending small groups of observers , despite the direct request made by the leaders of the States concerned .  
The most important symptoms reflecting insufficient capacity include the slow pace of policy and institutional reform ; weak intersectoral coordination ; the non-adoption of forestry programmes as priorities at the highest political levels ; the lack of clearly defined priorities ; and a continuing over-reliance on external technical assistance .  
There is far less enthusiasm now for sudden sharp changes in policies ( shock therapy ) than for slow , piecemeal and gradual changes in the light of the more stable and rapid growth in the centrally planned economies in Asia in contrast to disruptions and slow recovery of those in Europe , where changes were complete and sharp .  
Despite differences or variances in legal systems , there was general agreement that extant laws governing administrative systems are too many and are redundant ; enforcement is slow , and some laws simply can not be implemented for a variety of reasons : lack of resources , operational or resource constraints , irrelevance or inapplicability of prevailing conditions .  
Expresses deep concern at the slow pace of quartering and disarming UNITA troops , notes the public commitment by UNITA to quarter its troops in an expeditious and comprehensive fashion and reiterates its conviction that the quartering of UNITA forces , as the first step in its transformation to a legitimate political party , is a crucial component of the peace process ;  
Expresses deep concern at the slow pace of quartering and disarming UNITA troops , notes the public commitment by UNITA to quarter its troops in an expeditious and comprehensive fashion and reiterates its conviction that the quartering of UNITA forces , as the first step in its transformation to a legitimate political party , is a crucial component of the peace process ;  
During the 1980s , improvement efforts of all types in developing countries were disrupted by economic crises , most notably external debt crises and rising debt burdens , depressed commodity prices , slow growth of output and inadequate mobilization of domestic resources .  
Scientific journals and publications dealing with technological innovation and research are slow to reach Libya , especially publications issued by specialized international organizations and agencies that are active in disseminating information and technical data relating to the spread of plant and animal diseases and epidemics in various parts of the world .  
We must note with deep concern the delays , particularly in the areas of the quartering of UNITA troops ; the selection of soldiers for incorporation into the Angolan Armed Forces ( FAA ) ; and the slow process of the transfer of UNITA commanding officers to join the FAA , as well as the handing over to UNAVEM III of insufficient quantities of weapons and the poor quality of those handed over , and the continued presence of UNITA police .  
The international economy was displaying mixed characteristics : in the case of the developed countries , there were prospects of continued cyclical expansion , but there were also fears of inflation and resulting suggestions to contain growth rates , and there was increased unemployment and slow progress in the structural transformation of economies ; in the case of the developing countries , there were significant growth rates and a greater contribution to world trade , but also problems of poverty , lack of infrastructure , human resources and technological strength .  
However , in spite of donor support and encouragement , progress has been slow in most of these areas for two main reasons : lack of human and financial capacity to manage such complex reforms ; and political sensitivity , which call for broad consultations and negotiations involving Parliament and civil society , thereby further contributing to the complexity of the reform process .  
However , despite commitments made , barriers remained because the developed countries were still tempted by protectionism , as shown by anti-dumping measures , countervailing duties , progressive increases in duties , slow liberalization of the agricultural and textile sectors and the recourse to unilateral measures outside the WTO dispute settlement system , which was crucial for the defence of the developing countries ' trade interests .  
The problems facing sub-Saharan Africa were manifold : foreign debt service , slow economic growth , inadequate social investment , drought and environmental degradation , the growing HIV / AIDS epidemic , political instability and armed conflict .  
Although the Department of Peacekeeping Operations had established a number of bodies to increase its effectiveness , acquired considerable experience in that area and carried out many studies , Mozambique was concerned to see that the Organization remained slow to respond to conflict situations and that it repeated errors which had been committed in past operations .  Cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations must be improved .  
After touching briefly on the issue of economic growth and some of the reasons for the continued slow growth of the world economy , he said that it was increasingly being recognized that private capital flows were not a viable long-term solution .  
The representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran expressed concern that the Trade and Development Report 's forecast of slow world economic growth reflected the effects of the unequal access of developing countries to external lending and FDI .  
Although the level of resentment fluctuates , popular disappointment with the perceived slow pace of implementation of resolution 986 ( 1995 ) , and , in particular , erratic food distribution , delays in the arrival of medicines and severe power cuts , continues to be voiced against the United Nations , and a growing number of beneficiaries decline to be interviewed .  
The already slow process of development in those countries would be further impeded , requiring three types of countermeasures : slowing of population growth , promotion of North-South partnership , such as that envisioned in Agenda 21 and the final documents of other major United Nations conferences , and the eradication of poverty through the creation of an international economic climate favourable to the opening up of markets , debt reduction and increased financial resources flows from North to South .  
But equality of rights is not yet reflected in everyday life , owing to the slow pace of sociological and political change , resistance from the controllers of capital , clashing economic interests and the resultant widespread violence .  
There has been relatively slow progress in developing a system for environmental and economic accounting ( SEEA ) at the national level , although current efforts in a number of countries indicate that the SEEA may gain increasing attention in the near future .  
It is also of concern that problems such as the slow and erratic pace at which humanitarian inputs arrive in Iraq , the operating difficulties of the distribution system , and the deteriorating basic infrastructure in the various key sectors responsible for providing social services continue to hamper the implementation process .  
Economic growth in eastern Europe averaged 4 per cent , less than in 1995 and generally less than expected ; in Russia the slump in output deepened rather than bottoming out ; the expected boost to activity resulting from the ending of economic sanctions against Yugoslavia has been slow to materialize ; there were major economic setbacks in Bulgaria and Romania ; and in Albania an economic crisis developed into a state of political and social chaos in which the Government lost control of large parts of the country .  
Although the measures introduced in 1995 to restore internal and external balance to the Hungarian economy have made considerable progress in this direction , their impact on domestic demand and especially on household consumption has been more severe and more long-lasting than expected .  Economic growth in Slovenia also continued to slow down in 1996 , despite earlier forecasts of an acceleration .  
In the light of the international community 's increasing awareness of slow economic growth in many developing countries and countries in transition from a centrally planned economy to a free-market economy ( transitional economy countries ) and of the related negative global implications , it is essential that the United Nations should promote and implement action-oriented responses aimed at helping those countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth . 
During the discussions on methods of implementing economic , social and cultural rights , an implementation that necessitates a certain level of economic development and material support , the representatives of several developing countries expressed the fear that the inevitably slow progress in realizing those rights might be taken for unwillingness on their part . 
A number of experts expressed concern at the slow and cumbersome procedures which continued to cause considerable delays in moving transit cargo out of the port and across national boundaries .  
The United States has certainly designed a blockade that , like a vile medieval garrotte , has managed with slow and pyrrhic success to bring about innumerable shortages to 11-million human beings and has greatly hampered the country 's normal development .  
The months ahead will be crucial to the consolidation of essential political , social and economic transformations , and it is to be hoped that the activities leading up to the presidential elections of November 1999 will not slow down or halt the process .  
No one can deny that the negative trends of these last decades of the twentieth century are slow to reverse .  These include growing poverty , the marginalization of hundreds of millions of people , the precarious state of natural resources , the degradation of biological diversity , the destruction of forests , worsening pollution , rampant desertification , and so many other examples .  
Concerning external debt , the agreed formulations on problems relating to debt workouts by countries hit by financial crisis and on the slow progress in the implementation of the World Bank / IMF HIPC initiative represented a significant advance in international consensus on the subject .  
However , with growth of output in Africa projected to slow to about 2 per cent in 1999 below the level of population growth this modest recovery is already being threatened by international financial crises , declining commodity prices and regional conflicts .  
All major gynaecological centres in the country report an increase in the number of pregnant women suffering from threatened abortion , premature deliveries , slow foetal growth , higher Caesarean section incidence , etc .  
The period under review was marked by continuing negotiations , interrupted by repeated discord , and slow progress between the political parties and the Government of Haiti on how to continue to provide essential Government services , such as police and customs services , and how to further the cause of democracy through the organization of legislative and municipal elections .  
The Yugoslav Government and public is concerned , in particular , over the slow and altogether inefficient investigation of daily crimes committed throughout the Province , the tolerant and protective attitude towards Albanian terrorists and criminal gangs , whereby they are encouraged to realize their plan of ethnic cleansing of all of the non-Albanian population .  
It is of considerable regret to us that some of the soldiers serving in Sierra Leone on behalf of the international community , the non-UNAMSIL ECOMOG contingents , will not be funded on this basis and will instead continue to rely on voluntary contributions , which have been desperately slow in coming and which are , at least on the basis of past practice , unlikely to relieve significantly the financial burden ECOMOG troop-contributors have assumed .
