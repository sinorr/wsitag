This thinking is the foundation underlying all our efforts to build the party , is the cornerstone for exercising the ruling power , and is also the source of our party 's strength .  
In the new century , we shall be facing unprecedented opportunities and challenges .  The CPC , which shoulders the three major historical tasks , has once again set forth hopes and requirements for the younger generation .

We reached a particularly steep stretch of the path and my legs grew weary . Only a few slanting rays of sunlight managed to pierce the broad canopies of the enormous trees scattered about both sides of the path - - the forest 's parasol .

But chief editor Chuang Hui-chiu has done a masterful job of just that , spinning a broad tapestry that shows the interplay between individual emotions and collective experience .

But chief editor Chuang Hui-chiu has done a masterful job of just that , spinning a broad tapestry that shows the interplay between individual emotions and collective experience .
