In a weakly integrated society , several social groups or communities coexist , the structures of which , although informal , often prevail in reality on the formal institutional rules when their members are vested with official functions ; and conversely , a number of functions which tend to be differentiated in the society as a whole are taken over informally within the group or community .

In the process , the intermediation mechanism grows more varied and complex , ranging from the informal financial system comprising all legal financial activities outside the orbit of institutional and officially regulated finance , to a more complex modern system , supervised by a central monetary authority , that facilitates the transfer of large quantities of money within and between countries .  
NULLThe primary stage of financial intermediation is dominated by a combination of a large informal sector where transactions between lenders and borrowers are direct and personal , a currency-creating authority ( a central bank or a currency board ) , and a limited number of deposit-receiving and credit institutions like the commercial banks .

Five features of these transactions are noteworthy : reciprocity ( " I help you , you help me , when in need " ) ; insignificant transaction costs ; the open-ended ( no fixed maturity ) nature of many of these financial contracts ; the informality of screening devices ( personal knowledge of borrowers ) used in making loans ; and the informal sanctions ( such as social shunning of delinquents ) employed to enforce contracts .  
NULLThe basic purpose of the proposed policy initiative would be to exploit to the maximum , and in a cost-effective manner , the savings and credit potential of the informal and semi-formal financial system ; to strengthen its ability to mobilize small savings from relatively marginal sections of population ; and to encourage decentralized lending , that is , in areas largely untouched by the formal financial system .  
NULLThe policy initiative should begin with national efforts to seek to determine the overall magnitude of operations and the role of the institutions in the informal sector , to understand how they work and how sets of unwritten rules and social conventions have guided and sustained them against risks inherent in financial transactions .  
NULLTo encourage the development of educational and training systems more in line with the current and future needs of young people and their societies , it would be helpful to share experience and to investigate alternative arrangements , such as informal arrangements for the provision of basic literacy , job skills training and lifelong education .

The causes are as well-known as they are difficult to resolve : double standards ; lack of democracy , of public information and transparency ; informal consultations and secret lobbying ; the obsolete veto power ; and the threat of the veto , which has become an even more dangerous and unacceptable instrument because the consequences of using it are not publicly assumed .  
Since the moment last November when you , Sir , were kind enough to entrust me with the coordination of these consultations , we have held a total of 36 full days of meetings , in addition to many informal consultations , or hallway meetings in many cases coordinated by specific delegations that generously devoted their time and efforts to act as facilitators as well as countless individual contacts and joint internal discussions within the various groups .

Stabilization of prices and exchange rates would ensure positive rates of return on domestic assets , while a more aggressive drive by the formal financial institutions through intensive branch expansion , the broadening of the menu of saving instruments and the forging of strong linkages with the informal financial institutions , would have a positive impact on the volume of resources mobilized .

In the course of the active dialogue , it was suggested that such informal meetings as consultations with permanent missions scheduled by the substantive secretariats prior to sessions of intergovernmental bodies , which are serviced on an " as available " basis , should be coordinated sufficiently in advance with the Interpretation and Meetings Service to ensure that , whenever possible , the same room , staff and interpretation resources were used on a particular day . 
More capacity-building should be directed to local levels , focusing on assessing existing ( local ) knowledge to improve its utilization , the developing mechanisms for the optimal use of existing institutions and organizations at local levels , facilitating the formal and informal capacity-building activities of local institutions , non-governmental organizations and community groups through a decentralized approach , and developing and intensifying retraining systems for civil servants and others working at the local level , to promote interaction with the local actors .  
A number of innovations were already introduced at the ninth session of the Conference , including reducing documentation ; scaled down formal plenary sessions ; increased use of informal debates , circulated written statements and videotaped interventions ; and remote translation .  
In this , the political leadership is also obliged to support and foster the development of both the formal human rights institutions that were established by the Peace Agreement and Federation Constitutions , and the informal non-governmental structures that are an integral part of the development of civil society .  
The level and quality of employment have also declined considerably , as a result of the closing or low-level operation of obsolete enterprises , accompanied by extremely low wages in virtually every sector of the economy , which forces many workers , including those who are highly qualified , to quit their regular jobs and / or to seek their livelihood in the informal sector or in authorized self-employment , even where such jobs bear no relationship to their qualifications .

For each issue identified , the Expert Group reviewed ongoing research and existing coordination processes at the international level .  
Thus , the informal sector is not a transitory activity , as assumed in the 1970s , where the urban unemployed and rural migrants obtain temporary employment before moving on to the modern sector , but has become a permanent feature and an important means of survival for a large proportion of the urban population .  
Faced with the related phenomena of a large informal sector and a missing middle in their enterprise structure , LDCs need to take specific measures , in the context of their enterprise development strategies , targeted at helping their micro and small enterprises to grow and drawing them into the formal sector , through the development of an infrastructural and human resource base , the strengthening of their technological capabilities , and the provision of finance , training and other business support services .

Having noted that the tentative programme of work for the period 9-17 December 1996 included three sets of informal consultations on the question of human resources management , his delegation wondered whether , if no tangible progress was made during the first round of consultations , the remaining time slots could be devoted to other priority items .  
BAKER ( Israel ) shared the view expressed by the Commission as to the difficulty of distinguishing between codification and progressive development of international law , especially in an era in which the development of international law took place in specialized spheres through the activities of various institutions , the regionalization of the handling of specific issues and an increase in law-making bodies , whether private or official , formal or informal .  
Responding to this productive mood , and convinced that we could advance the process if we continued , our delegations proposed and the Fourth Committee agreed to defer action on the draft resolution and continue the informal dialogue to tackle the more difficult issues still outstanding .  
During the period under review , the Council 's informal working group on documentation and other procedural questions worked hard to find ways of satisfying the wish of Member States to receive in a timely manner a substantive , analytical and material account of the Council 's work .

The level and quality of employment have also declined considerably , as a result of the closing or low-level operation of obsolete enterprises , accompanied by extremely low wages in virtually every sector of the economy , which forces many workers , including those who are highly qualified , to quit their regular jobs and / or to seek their livelihood in the informal sector or in authorized self-employment , even where such jobs bear no relationship to their qualifications .  
Further discussions focusing on the major group concept in informal settings , such as inter-sessional workshops or seminars , may help to develop a better understanding of the concept and how it can be further operationalized in the context of local , national , regional and international institutions working on sustainable development .

Although it is true that the untaxed informal sector may escape some legitimate tax burdens and necessary social regulation , its continued existence leads to socially valuable production .  
Its major premise is that women predominate in informal trade activities in many parts of Africa , yet they often run their businesses handicapped by inadequate legal protection , policies , capital and skills conducive to successful business operations . 
It was recognized that further deliberations on this complex and critical subject would require a set of wellpaced consultations , both formal and informal , over the period leading up to the establishment of the framework at the annual session 1995 .  
The sheer volume of the report and the figures , set forth in Ambassador Al-Khussaiby 's introduction , of the formal and informal meetings held , the various reports and communications considered , the resolutions adopted and the statements made by the President clearly demonstrate the heavy workload of the Council and illustrate the growing importance of the Security Council in world security issues .  
It is pertinent to indicate that the financial reforms , as the report before us notes , have so far focused almost exclusively on the formal financial sector and have neglected the informal sector with quite a vast savings potential .  
It is our hope that the informal consultations to be held later this week will lead to workable solutions concerning the election of 36 members of the Council of the International Seabed Authority , comprising four groups representing the various interests in seabed mining , plus 18 members to be elected in accordance with the principal legal systems of the world and equitable geographical distribution , in accordance with article 161 of the Convention .

The representative stated that numerous studies showed the extent to which informal sector had contributed to the national economy , and it was also proved that women 's contribution to the informal sector could reduce the negative effects of the structural adjustment plan .  
Strengthening international data collection and statistical systems to support countries in monitoring social development goals ; and encouraging the expansion of international databases to incorporate socially beneficial activities not included in available data , such as women 's unremunerated work and contributions to society , the informal economy , and sustainable livelihoods ;  
Among the African countries in the franc zone , it has experienced the longest period of political instability - nearly 30 years of recurrent civil wars and border conflicts - thus its socio-economic infrastructure is rudimentary and concentrated in the capital ; the administrative capacity is very weak , and the private sector has little structure and is dominated by informal and black market activities .  
In the developing countries , conceptual and methodological constraints and conventional labour force definitions and statistical systems still do not adequately reflect women 's productive work in the non-market economy , as producers in subsistence agriculture and in the urban and rural informal sector .  
These confidence-building measures , which could lead to an informal suspension of offensive military operations , would constitute a demonstration of good will aimed at alleviating the suffering of the civilian population in areas affected by the armed confrontation , protecting human rights and facilitating the work of MINUGUA as well as all national entities devoted to the protection and promotion of human rights . 
The major areas identified in the Plan are human rights and the promotion of equality ; employment promotion including improving the situation of women in the labour market , women workers in the formal and informal sectors ; training ; working conditions and environment ; social security ; labour legislation , labour relations , labour administration , workers ' and employers ' activities ; women in specific industrial sectors ; and in the different regions .

PE \ x { 54fb } ( Mexico ) , Vice-Chairman , reporting on the informal consultations on draft decision A / C . 5 / 49 / L . 52 , said that it had been decided that Member States ' respective share of the unencumbered balance of $ 1,755,000 gross ( $ 16,000 net ) for the period from 1 February 1994 to 31 January 1995 inclusive would be set off against the apportionment falling due to them in respect of whatever future mandate period ( s ) were approved by the Security Council .  
In a weakly integrated society , several social groups or communities coexist , the structures of which , although informal , often prevail in reality on the formal institutional rules when their members are vested with official functions ; and conversely , a number of functions which tend to be differentiated in the society as a whole are taken over informally within the group or community . 
The economy is dual and is characterized by an important informal sector directed towards customers with a low purchasing power , and by a modern economy based on a solid port and airport infrastructure , serving a population with a high purchasing power but almost strictly dependent on imports .  
In accordance with decisions of the Committee on Conferences , the time utilized for informal meetings or consultations held before the start or after the adjournment of officially scheduled meetings is not included as time lost due to late starting or early ending of meetings .  
The Colloquium took place in agreeable , secluded surroundings which provided an atmosphere conducive to an informal and frank exchange of ideas and experience , further enhanced by unanimous agreement that the Colloquium would depart from the traditional format of United Nations system meetings and eschew the presentation of formal views of individual organizations .  The participants would not present the papers they had prepared , which would serve simply as background documents .  
Their impact is based on the role entrepreneurship plays in long-term economic growth , on the special role small - and medium-sized enterprises and the informal sector ( where women 's businesses are concentrated ) play in economic development , and on the major social benefits associated with the greater economic autonomy and access to markets and decision-making that are inevitably linked to women 's access to and ability to command resources . 
In the process , the intermediation mechanism grows more varied and complex , ranging from the informal financial system comprising all legal financial activities outside the orbit of institutional and officially regulated finance , to a more complex modern system , supervised by a central monetary authority , that facilitates the transfer of large quantities of money within and between countries .  
NULLThe primary stage of financial intermediation is dominated by a combination of a large informal sector where transactions between lenders and borrowers are direct and personal , a currency-creating authority ( a central bank or a currency board ) , and a limited number of deposit-receiving and credit institutions like the commercial banks .  
An apparent alienation of the formal financial system from indigenous economic actors , especially in the rural areas , and in the urban informal sector and small-scale enterprises .  
Five features of these transactions are noteworthy : reciprocity ( " I help you , you help me , when in need " ) ; insignificant transaction costs ; the open-ended ( no fixed maturity ) nature of many of these financial contracts ; the informality of screening devices ( personal knowledge of borrowers ) used in making loans ; and the informal sanctions ( such as social shunning of delinquents ) employed to enforce contracts .  
NULLThe basic purpose of the proposed policy initiative would be to exploit to the maximum , and in a cost-effective manner , the savings and credit potential of the informal and semi-formal financial system ; to strengthen its ability to mobilize small savings from relatively marginal sections of population ; and to encourage decentralized lending , that is , in areas largely untouched by the formal financial system .  
NULLThe policy initiative should begin with national efforts to seek to determine the overall magnitude of operations and the role of the institutions in the informal sector , to understand how they work and how sets of unwritten rules and social conventions have guided and sustained them against risks inherent in financial transactions .  
NULLTo encourage the development of educational and training systems more in line with the current and future needs of young people and their societies , it would be helpful to share experience and to investigate alternative arrangements , such as informal arrangements for the provision of basic literacy , job skills training and lifelong education .

The discussions and debate in the informal drafting group were intensive and were marked by wide and active participation on the part of delegations , reflecting the importance of the issues addressed by the preparatory process .  
developing countries , an active private sector , including the informal sector - whose linkages with the formal sector should be strengthened - and small and medium-sized enterprises provided the principal means to generate productive employment .  
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights and access to economic resources , and to increase women 's access to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women , and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ; 
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights and access to economic resources , and to increase women 's access to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women , and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ;  
The causes are as well-known as they are difficult to resolve : double standards ; lack of democracy , of public information and transparency ; informal consultations and secret lobbying ; the obsolete veto power ; and the threat of the veto , which has become an even more dangerous and unacceptable instrument because the consequences of using it are not publicly assumed .  
Since the moment last November when you , Sir , were kind enough to entrust me with the coordination of these consultations , we have held a total of 36 full days of meetings , in addition to many informal consultations , or hallway meetings in many cases coordinated by specific delegations that generously devoted their time and efforts to act as facilitators as well as countless individual contacts and joint internal discussions within the various groups .  
On the home front , supporting the private and informal sectors , promotion of self-employment , provision of credit facilities to the unemployed , encouraging the creation of volunteer organizations including grass-roots financial organizations , investment in training and education programmes , optimal use of resources such as land and water , expansion of labour-intensive economic activities and a focus on the service sector are among the necessary first steps .  
For our part , we have carefully analyzed our position in the light of the views expressed so far in the discussions and we will soon present our considerations in the form of an informal position paper , which will elaborate on our previously presented views concerning the most important aspects of the Security Council 's future , including one of the most difficult among them : the issue of the size of the Council and the allocation of newly created seats . 
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights and access to economic resources , and to increase women 's access to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women , and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ;  
Strengthening financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes , and strengthening cooperation among Governments at all levels , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises , and international institutions , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to low-income individuals , women , and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups for shelter and human settlements development ;  
Encourage Governments to intensify the search for pragmatic methods for increasing cooperation between exporters and importers with a view to facilitating the efforts of developing countries to take account of environmental costs in their development process and to assess the scope for the establishment of sectoral round tables and other formal or informal arrangements for identifying efficient and cost-effective approaches .  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
Conduct thematic studies to evaluate poverty alleviation strategies , especially with reference to women workers in the informal sector - on such themes as poverty , household food security and gender , focusing on the feminization of poverty as expressed in food insecurity ; conduct studies with respect to adapting successful credit systems in different socio-cultural areas , with particular emphasis on the needs of poor rural women , and to integrating information on credit systems into non-formal education ; undertake case-studies on the role of female entrepreneurs in the least developed countries ;  
Stabilization of prices and exchange rates would ensure positive rates of return on domestic assets , while a more aggressive drive by the formal financial institutions through intensive branch expansion , the broadening of the menu of saving instruments and the forging of strong linkages with the informal financial institutions , would have a positive impact on the volume of resources mobilized .  
Strengthening international data collection and statistical systems to support countries in monitoring social development goals and encouraging the expansion of international databases to incorporate socially beneficial activities that are not included in available data , such as women 's unremunerated work and contributions to society , the informal economy and sustainable livelihoods ;  
Strengthening and improving financial and technical assistance for community-based development and self-help programmes and strengthening cooperation among Governments , community organizations , cooperatives , formal and informal banking institutions , private enterprises and international agencies , with the aim of mobilizing local savings , promoting the creation of local financial networks , and increasing the availability of credit and market information to small entrepreneurs , small farmers and other low-income self-employed workers , with particular efforts to ensure the availability of such services to women .  
In the course of the active dialogue , it was suggested that such informal meetings as consultations with permanent missions scheduled by the substantive secretariats prior to sessions of intergovernmental bodies , which are serviced on an " as available " basis , should be coordinated sufficiently in advance with the Interpretation and Meetings Service to ensure that , whenever possible , the same room , staff and interpretation resources were used on a particular day . 
More capacity-building should be directed to local levels , focusing on assessing existing ( local ) knowledge to improve its utilization , the developing mechanisms for the optimal use of existing institutions and organizations at local levels , facilitating the formal and informal capacity-building activities of local institutions , non-governmental organizations and community groups through a decentralized approach , and developing and intensifying retraining systems for civil servants and others working at the local level , to promote interaction with the local actors .  
A number of innovations were already introduced at the ninth session of the Conference , including reducing documentation ; scaled down formal plenary sessions ; increased use of informal debates , circulated written statements and videotaped interventions ; and remote translation .  
In this , the political leadership is also obliged to support and foster the development of both the formal human rights institutions that were established by the Peace Agreement and Federation Constitutions , and the informal non-governmental structures that are an integral part of the development of civil society .  
The level and quality of employment have also declined considerably , as a result of the closing or low-level operation of obsolete enterprises , accompanied by extremely low wages in virtually every sector of the economy , which forces many workers , including those who are highly qualified , to quit their regular jobs and / or to seek their livelihood in the informal sector or in authorized self-employment , even where such jobs bear no relationship to their qualifications .  
It requested the President of the Council to establish arrangements for informal open-ended consultations during the Council 's substantive session of 1997 ; decided to include in the provisional agenda of its substantive session of 1997 an item entitled " Implementation of General Assembly resolution 50 / 227 " ; and decided to further consider the review of the functional commission and expert groups and bodies comprehensively during a resumed substantive session in the autumn of 1997 and to take decisions at that time .  
Liberal International stated that it supported the rights of minorities by establishing formal or informal relations with minority organizations and their political parties , providing education and training , a platform for exchange as well as links to the Council of Europe , the United Nations and other international bodies , and assisting in raising awareness of minority issues at the international level .  
The High Commissioner stressed the importance of human rights education in the school system , welcomed the impressive amount of human rights education , both formal and informal , ongoing in Cambodia , and informed the workshop participants of United Nations efforts to promote human rights education worldwide through the mechanism of the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education . 
The Expert Group recognized the need to create forums in which national statistical agency experts could address technical issues , and emphasized that informal ad hoc groups comprised of representatives of a small number of countries , constituted along the lines of the Voorburg Group on Service Statistics , could play an effective role in addressing such technical issues due to their greater flexibility compared to intersecretariat groups .  12 .  For each issue identified , the Expert Group reviewed ongoing research and existing coordination processes at the international level .  
Thus , the informal sector is not a transitory activity , as assumed in the 1970s , where the urban unemployed and rural migrants obtain temporary employment before moving on to the modern sector , but has become a permanent feature and an important means of survival for a large proportion of the urban population .  
Faced with the related phenomena of a large informal sector and a missing middle in their enterprise structure , LDCs need to take specific measures , in the context of their enterprise development strategies , targeted at helping their micro and small enterprises to grow and drawing them into the formal sector , through the development of an infrastructural and human resource base , the strengthening of their technological capabilities , and the provision of finance , training and other business support services .

While informal consultative mechanisms do exist to deal with cases in which the Appointment and Promotion Board might disagree with local Appointment and Promotion Committee recommendations , the Secretary-General takes note of the JIU suggestion that more formal mechanisms should be established so as to avoid situations where the imposition of a placement or promotion decision against a programme manager 's considered recommendation is not the source of future difficulties for the staff member thus selected to fill a position .  
Having noted that the tentative programme of work for the period 9-17 December 1996 included three sets of informal consultations on the question of human resources management , his delegation wondered whether , if no tangible progress was made during the first round of consultations , the remaining time slots could be devoted to other priority items .  
BAKER ( Israel ) shared the view expressed by the Commission as to the difficulty of distinguishing between codification and progressive development of international law , especially in an era in which the development of international law took place in specialized spheres through the activities of various institutions , the regionalization of the handling of specific issues and an increase in law-making bodies , whether private or official , formal or informal .  
Responding to this productive mood , and convinced that we could advance the process if we continued , our delegations proposed and the Fourth Committee agreed to defer action on the draft resolution and continue the informal dialogue to tackle the more difficult issues still outstanding .  
During the period under review , the Council 's informal working group on documentation and other procedural questions worked hard to find ways of satisfying the wish of Member States to receive in a timely manner a substantive , analytical and material account of the Council 's work .  
In other fields , such as the institutional aspects of national statistical offices , the informal sector and external trade , less structured activities have also been defined and the objective exists of incorporating them into the regional programme .  
At the informal consultations held on 15 January 1997 at a briefing by UNDCP for permanent missions to the United Nations ( Vienna ) , there was agreement that the bureau of the special segment ( preparatory body ) should be distinct from that of the regular segment ( functional commission ) and should remain in office until the special session .  
The level and quality of employment have also declined considerably , as a result of the closing or low-level operation of obsolete enterprises , accompanied by extremely low wages in virtually every sector of the economy , which forces many workers , including those who are highly qualified , to quit their regular jobs and / or to seek their livelihood in the informal sector or in authorized self-employment , even where such jobs bear no relationship to their qualifications .  
Further discussions focusing on the major group concept in informal settings , such as inter-sessional workshops or seminars , may help to develop a better understanding of the concept and how it can be further operationalized in the context of local , national , regional and international institutions working on sustainable development .  
Furthermore , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
In my view , the three sessions of the open _ ended informal Presidential consultations , each devoted to such issues as nuclear disarmament , a fissile material cut _ off treaty and anti _ personnel landmines , were useful and contributed to moving the overall process of the CD forward .  
The Economic and Social Council , by its decision 1996 / 244 , decided that the Commission at its sixth session , in addition to plenary meetings , should be provided with full interpretation services for a total of 12 meetings for informal consultations on draft proposals and for meetings of open-ended working groups , the precise allocation of time for the different types of meetings to be determined by the Commission at its sixth session under item 2 of its agenda , entitled " Adoption of the agenda and organization of work " .

On the basis of a set of background documents and a compendium of summarized project proposals the informal consultative group stressed the importance of crime prevention and criminal justice in development , analysed the role of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme , its comparative advantages and potential , and recommended specific modalities of resource mobilization , after having reviewed national policies and practices relating to development-assistance funding .  
Consultations and coordination with IMF , the World Bank and other relevant specialized organizations , including UNCTAD and the regional commissions ; provision of improved global on-line access to the LINK model and its analytical databases to other bodies of the United Nations system and to Member States ; external relations with a network of non-governmental research institutes through the exchange of background papers and informal consultations .  
The Agreement on the Definitive Ceasefire was implemented and the deadlines and procedures established therein were strictly observed , confirming the willingness of the Government and URNG to put a definitive end to the armed conflict , as evidenced throughout 1996 in the peace negotiations and in the informal ceasefire which went into effect on 19 March 1996 .  
Taking note of the progress of the ad hoc open-ended informal inter _ sessional working group established by the Commission at its thirty _ ninth session for the purpose of considering options for improving the work of the Commission and its subsidiary bodies , in particular its agenda and organization , and of examining the role of the Commission as the governing body of the Programme , as well as possible options designed to enhance active participation by more Member States ,

The Special Rapporteur affirmed that , owing to their double marginalization as women and as migrants , women migrant workers might easily find themselves in situations in which they were vulnerable to violence and abuse , especially since women migrant workers dominated the informal labour market of most countries , working as domestic , industrial or agricultural labourers , or within the service industry . 
Djibouti has a dual economy that is characterized by an important informal sector directed towards customers with a low purchasing power , and secondly , by a modern economy , based on a solid port and airport infrastructure , serving a population with high purchasing power but one that depends almost entirely on imports .  
The tripartite gathering , the sixth in a series launched in July 1993 , represented a further advance in the informal process of sharing of information , improving coordination , avoiding duplication and optimizing the utilization of scarce resources .  
Further , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .

The articles in the four publications covered a wide spectrum of issues , including the critical role of the informal sector in the development of indigenous industrial capabilities ; the development of international competitiveness ; the private sector and entrepreneurship development ; privatization in Africa ; the Uruguay Round Agreements and implications for African industry ; and the current status of African metallurgy industries and prospects for the year 2000 .  
Throughout the session , intensive consultations , both formal and informal , were held under the authority of the successive Presidents with a view to clarifying positions and developing a minimum common ground which would allow the Conference to discharge its mandate as the sole multilateral negotiating forum of the international community in the field of disarmament .  
The approach goes beyond existing formal institutional frameworks to encompass substantive and informal aspects related to the real structures and ethical and cultural traits that underlie political behaviour .  
Urges all Governments to ensure women 's equal rights and access to economic resources and to increase women 's access to credit by instituting innovative lending practices , including practices that integrate credit with services and training for women and that provide flexible credit facilities to women , in particular rural women , women in the informal sector , young women and women who lack access to traditional sources of collateral ;

In India , for example , where the overwhelming proportion of the work force is engaged in the unorganized or informal sector which should not be confused with the illegal sector , as has sometimes been done the extent of unemployment or underemployment measured by the criterion of time spent at work is relatively low .
