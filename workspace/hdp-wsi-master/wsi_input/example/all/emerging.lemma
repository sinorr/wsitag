At present , nearly 70 large projects , with 10-million US dollars being invested in each , have already spread out in a belt standing tall with more than 100 square kilometers along the 20 kilometer Gold Coast of Ningbo 's Beilun district , forming a recently emerging large industrial economic belt with leading industries such as petrochemical , iron and steel and developing subsidiary industries such as electric power , machinery , electronics , light industry and textile , building materials , plastic cement , etc .  
While participating in a discussion held by the Beijing NPC Delegation , Deputy Wu Bangguo , member of the CPC Central Committee Political Bureau and vice premier of the State Council , stressed : It is necessary to use new and high technologies to transform traditional industries and to vigorously develop emerging industries as well as new and high-tech industries so as to advance the readjustment and upgrading of the industrial structure .  
A new round of structural adjustment is being carried out throughout the world ; new - and high-technology industry and newly emerging industry are developing robust ; intellectual economy has raged like a storm , and world economic competition has become increasingly intense .  
Not only the decadent capitalist ideas and style of life of the West are corroding us at every moment ; the influence of feudal ideas and other ideas of exploiting class remains as well .  In addition , the loopholes and weak links emerging in the course of economic restructuring have provided soil and conditions for the spreading of negative and corrupt phenomena .  
On the one hand , peace and development are the themes of the modern world , scientific and technological progress are bringing about changes with each passing day , the process of economic globalization is speeding up development , a trend of multi-polarization is emerging in the world structure , and competition between large nations for comprehensive national power is increasingly fierce .  
At the time of great social changes taking place and during a special historical era of moving from a closed society to an opened society , people should experience bigger fluctuations in ideology and mentality .  They might feel confused and incomprehensible about the new social phenomena which are constantly emerging or even make deviations and errors in understanding .  All these should eventually be resolved in practice through relying on the self-education of the masses .  
What warrants our special attention is that the " Proposal " for the first time oriented the " vigorous promotion of the national economy and universal application of information technologies in society " as a " strategic move to embrace the overall construction for modernization " , unequivocally proposing that the " information technology should contribute to industrialization , display its newly emerging superiority , and achieve leaping development in the social productive forces " .  
Internationally , socialism is temporarily at a low point throughout the world while capitalism is temporarily looking prosperous .  Some developed western countries rely on their advantages in economy , science and technology to accelerate their strategy of " westernizing " or " splitting " our country .  Both international political struggles and contradictions in society and ideology are in an unprecedented sophisticated situation and unprecedented complex issues are emerging .  
To properly deal with various conflicts and differences emerging under the new situation and strive to create a relaxed , stable , united and harmonious political environment has become a fundamental condition for developing and strengthening the patriotic united front .  
Economically , the ideology of the Western bourgeoisie emerging in theoretical patterns often serves its economic interests .  For example , the theory of " free trade " has long become the " moral reference " for the developed countries in the West to freely import and export their capital and commodities into and out of developing countries to seek excessive profits for monopolistic capital .  
Li Changchun and his party had earlier visited Mumbai , India 's western financial and commercial city , and Hyderabad , a newly emerging science and technology city in southern India . In Mumbai , Li Changchun attended a Guangdong-Indian economic and technology trade fair .  
Non-public-run economic organizations , social bodies , and civilian-run non-enterprise units are emerging in large numbers , and are producing a major influence on the economic , cultural , and social development of our country .  To guide these economic and social bodies to attain a healthy development , we need to have correct principles and policies as well as a perfect legal system , and we also need to strengthen the party 's political leadership .  
They hold the key to how the emerging countries should deal with today 's international order and rules .  The many problems China has run into in its modernization process , including its backward political , military , economic conditions today , make many people suspicious of the rules of international competition and contemporary warfare .  Many believe that under the rules drawn up mainly by the Western developed countries , China can never win .

In the historical process of the new emerging out of the old , mankind 's advanced culture consciously represents the mainstream of the times , the orientation of social development , and the will of the people and is an active and dynamic spiritual force for guiding and promoting historical progress .  
According to incomplete statistics , at present , the China strategic guided missile troop already has more than 200 mentors with doctorate or master degrees .  Those academics from the department of engineering , a large group of national class experts , and people who are treated with special allowance by the government are emerging .  
He said : In the contemporary era , new knowledge keeps emerging in vast multitude , science and technology are advancing with each passing day , and the social productive forces are considerably elevated , which have produced enormous impacts on the world 's political , economic , cultural , and social lives , so that human beings are confronted with new , tremendous historical changes and leaps .  
Wang Liheng indicated that in the future , the corporation will give priority to developing communications satellites , natural resources satellites , meteorological satellites , disaster reduction satellites , a system of satellites to forecast and appraise small satellites , and the ground application system .

In the theoretical circle , there is also a " theory on the advantages of being a late starter , " which advocates that the temporary economic and cultural backwardness will not stop the newly emerging countries and regions from directly assimilating and using the latest achievements of civilization and catching up with and surpassing the developed countries and regions .  
It has been pointed out that in the late 80s and early 90s , the capacity and willingness of Western financial institutions to reach out for more exotic high-yielding investment made private sectors of major emerging economies with strong growth potential their prime target . 
There was an emerging consensus at the meeting on product coverage , target end rates and target end dates for liberalising the nine sectors selected by APEC Economic Leaders in Vancouver last November for fast track action .  Ministers endorsed a number of specific recommendations on the basis of which Senior Officials will work towards a credible package of balanced and mutually beneficial arrangements , for consideration at the Tenth APEC Ministerial Meeting to be held in Kuala Lumpur in November 1998 .  
Domestic financial laxity and economic policy distortions were common factors in Asia . The wild swings of fast-flowing and highly-leveraged speculative capital in narrower emerging markets led to strong overshoots which were highly destabilising and severely eroded investor and consumer confidence .  
Yet the spokesman observed that there were certain positive signs emerging more recently , including improved liquidity from the earlier tight situation , successive cuts in local interest rates , and rebound in share prices and flat prices .  
" Regarding market surveillence , intermediaries supervision , compensation arrangements and listing / corporate finance , the proposal now receiving emerging consensus basically represents a logical and natural development from the existing arrangement , having regard to the nature of NewCo . The objective is to reduce regulatory overlaps through clearer delineation and refinement of respective responsibilities , " the spokesman added .  
Although the exact scope and modality of the next round of services negotiations have not yet been agreed among WTO members , we are glad to note that there is emerging support for the coverage to be comprehensive and the need to minimize the trade-distorting effects of domestic regulation and anti-competitive behaviour .  
" Local professional bodies , regulatory institutions and the government will monitor the development of the markets and take necessary measures to keep our regulatory regime up to date and abreast with the global trend .  Above all , we will strike a proper balance between the protection of the rights of investors and assistance rendered to the emerging enterprises so as to ensure that our financial industries will continue to flourish in the new economy , " she stressed .  
Mr Leung said : " The global financial system remains under stress , given large external deficit of the US , extended deflation and weak banking system in Japan , significant correction in major equity markets , more volatility and misalignments in exchange rates , and problems in key emerging markets like Argentina and Turkey . "  
" Our strengths in financial services and professional skills - management , accounting , legal services , consulting , marketing and international sourcing , couple with our excellent air , sea and telecommunications infrastructure , underline our role as a leading regional and international hub as the world goes to China , the mother of all emerging markets in the 21st century , " he added .  
By the same token , monasteries do not sell recordings of the special music used to help hungry ghosts cross the threshold from hell during Ghost Month , the seventh month of the Chinese lunar calendar . Playing such music at random could well result in hungry ghosts emerging from hell only to find that no food and alms await them-thus defeating the charitable object of the exercise and pointlessly bothering the ghosts .  
Not the first time Each of these emerging bands has a style of its own , but they also have in common a way of combining homegrown and western styles of music . For example , Luan Tan 's beiguan-derived music alludes to the communal rural spirit of earlier times , something which is being rediscovered in the extra-curricular life of today 's students . It is a collective , pluralist mode of creation which contrasts starkly with the staleness of mainstream pop and illuminates new possibilities for music in Taiwan .  
Some months ago you ran a feature on digital content , and recently you also reported the development of nanotechnology in Taiwan . From these articles we can see how sensitive the government is to the development of new technologies , and how-whether by their own initiative or with government guidance-many large , medium and small enterprises are getting involved in R &amp; D or production related to these emerging technologies .  
The Archdiocesan Finance Committee held that the deal would bankrupt the archdiocesan since there was an increasing number of allegations of sexual abuse emerging and " dramatic changes had taken place after the agreement was put forward " .  
He said he believed that as long as the state leaders and politicians in both China and Japan strictly observed the principles and spirit contained in the three documents and properly handled existing and emerging problems , a healthy and stable China Japan relationship can move forward into the 21st century  
The end of the cold war , the emerging enhanced role of the United Nations and the prevailing political climate of conciliation create an ideal environment for an effective effort to achieve permanent solutions to long-standing problems .  
Recognition is now emerging that conventional economic analysis methods , as applied to agricultural projects that do not take into account the degradation of the natural resource base , do not provide a suitable measure of longterm sustainability .  
Indeed , after a long period of conservative and incremental technical change , alternative process routes for mineral production are being developed and these are emerging as economically more efficient as well as environmentally less hazardous .  
It bases its findings on the emergence of new strategies and structures at the firm level which , in the aggregate , suggest that a more integrated international production system is emerging and may influence the future pattern of global economic relations .

It is regrettable that today , as the United Nations celebrates its fiftieth year since the signing of the Organization 's Charter in San Francisco , many people in Africa continue to live under even harsher conditions of poverty , hunger , disease , civil war and natural disaster .  The plight of the African continent remains a major challenge for the emerging world order .  
This fiftieth anniversary is indeed cause for celebration : United Nations membership has grown from 51 States to 185 ; the old colonial empires , as we all know , have been dismantled , even if new forms are emerging ; the cold war may seem to be at an end , though many of us are still living with its very painful legacies ; and issues of the environment , women and children , social development and population have been placed at the centre of the development agenda .  
This universality of the Organization can naturally put tremendous resources at its disposal to facilitate the achievement of the principles and objectives of the United Nations Charter , particularly the maintenance of international peace and security , the promotion of economic and social development , justice and mutual cooperation , and place it in a better position to deal with emerging challenges in a more efficient and distinguished fashion .  
An increase in the membership of the Security Council should therefore accommodate new permanent members , which should join on the basis of a combination of these and other appropriate criteria , reflecting , among other things , the new and emerging constellation of Powers and their proven regional and global responsibilities , as well as political , economic and demographic realities .  
In this context , we call on the international community to support appropriately the commendable efforts of the Palestinian Authority for economic , social and cultural development in the occupied territories and to consolidate the institutional and socio-economic structures of the emerging Palestinian entity so that it will be able to fulfil its responsibilities in the best possible conditions . 
Without a realistic and sufficiently operational vision for dealing with the basic security and political issues in the region , the OSCE will not be able to play an active role and will react to emerging situations in a random and not necessarily successful manner .  
The subjects and emerging issues to be addressed in greater detail , both globally and for major countries and groups of countries , will include the following : output and income , macroeconomic policy-making , the world energy situation , international trade and trade policy , international transfers of financial resources and financial cooperation , and other selected social and economic issues of a more structural nature .

However , there are several emerging interdisciplinary subject areas that are not yet adequately addressed by specific scientific programmes at the international level .  
A meeting in 1994 of biotechnology managers from more than 40 developing countries , mostly members of the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology ( ICGEB ) , to explore emerging biotechnologies and industrial opportunities revealed that the understanding and appreciation of local entrepreneurs with regard to the economic potential of the biotechnology industry are still very low .

Recommendation 1 , Catalytic role of UNEP in emerging environmental issues : UNDP should , in its catalytic role in emerging environmental issues , draw to a greater extent on the contributions of the United Nations system and of the international scientific and other professional communities , to ensure that problems of wide international significance receive appropriate and adequate consideration by Governments , through the Governing Council and other bodies .  
In addition , just as the period of low interest rates in industrialized countries was associated with large portfolio shifts that pushed emerging equity market prices up sharply , so this period of rising long-term bond yields has been associated with a moderation of capital flows to developing countries and a downward correction in many of the emerging stock markets .  
In part this is because of the role of external forces ( e.g . , economic growth and interest rates in the OECD area ) in " diverting " funds from OECD economies to the emerging markets and also because other influences are of a transient or finite nature ( e.g . , resulting from privatizations and returning flight capital ) .  
There seems to be an emerging consensus on two points : ( a ) United Nations involvement in peace-keeping should be scaled back and authorized limited operations should be conducted with greater cost effectiveness ; and ( b ) there should be increasing emphasis on preventive strategies and programmes that address the economic , social and other root causes of conflicts .  
An international symposium on sources of innovation in multilateralism was held , in cooperation with the University of Lausanne , Switzerland , in May to re-examine the nature of global changes and the challenges posed to the United Nations , including its reform proposals , as well as emerging new social forces such as women 's movements , endogenous peoples , human rights activists and others .

Delegations supported the broad goals of these recommendations , which were for UNEP to ( i ) reinforce its catalytic role , ( ii ) enhance its environmental coordinating activities within the United Nations system ; and ( iii ) facilitate its capacity to address emerging environmental issues .  
In addition , small and medium-sized enterprises require sectoral policies , networking and basic technical support , while the capacity for developing human resources must be built up so that emerging industries in the occupied territories can respond effectively to the new industrial development challenges .  
Beginning in the 1960s , during the decolonization of Africa , the active presence of bands of mercenaries constituted a resource for the colonial interests that wished to remain in the region , hindering the process of self-determination from which new African States were emerging or giving rise to situations of destabilization and war in which the mercenary ingredient played a primary role in intensifying and internationalizing the armed conflict .  
The project aimed at consolidating major existing and emerging legal principles relating to environmental conservation and sustainable development into an internationally binding legal instrument , thus contributing to the progressive development of international environmental law .  
At the same time , there is a growing realization that technological cooperation among developing countries can not be limited to meetings at the governmental or departmental level and that more effort should be made to involve individual firms , including SMEs . Firms cooperate when they perceive a business opportunity and possibilities for technological empowerment .  41 / Several forms of such inter-firm regional cooperation have been emerging in different countries .

NULLThe most pressing task faced by the Department of Public Information is to ensure that the centrality of the United Nations in meeting the compelling challenges faced by the international community continues to be widely recognized by Governments and the world public at large , including in particular the influential non-official actors emerging on the world stage .  
NULLAlthough the case of Mexico had several unique features , once the crisis began international securities investors suddenly reassessed their risks in all the emerging market economies : the contagious effect of the Mexican crisis left no developing country untouched in the short term . 
It was further suggested that the end of the cold war , the growing integration of the world economy and the emerging consensus on development policies seemed to have created a propitious confluence of forces in favour of a constructive and non-confrontational dialogue designed to meet the global challenges of poverty and development in a rapidly changing international environment .  
NULLWe note with satisfaction that today , now that many ideological barriers have fallen and the " cold war " has ended , new opportunities are emerging for a more peaceful world and a system of genuine global security with the United Nations as the central element . 
The potential for expanded economic and technical cooperation between LDCs and other developing countries merits further exploration and support by the international community , especially in view of the new opportunities emerging with the dynamic growth experience of a number of those other developing countries .  
Australia was actively promoting more innovative and effective approaches to emerging refugee and humanitarian problems ; was willing to respond generously to humanitarian need in all forums and was committed to alleviating the plight of displaced persons and refugees , the resettlement of whom had contributed to shaping his country into a culturally diverse and tolerant nation .  
The Committee 's deliberations therefore had to take account of the fact that the Organization 's political mandate needed to be coupled with effective funding based on realistic considerations rather than short-term assessments that would further weaken emerging democracies or the struggling economies of developing countries .

These processes are , paradoxically , at the basis of both integration and fragmentation phenomena ; they challenge individual States , and the international community as a whole , to take innovative initiatives that address the social risks that are emerging at the global level along with environmental risks .  
It is already clear today that the conflict imposed on the Tajik people an enormous human tragedy was aimed at undermining the newly emerging foundations of the State and interfering with economic growth and market reforms and hence the country 's independent development along a general democratic course .  
In our endeavours to face the challenges of humanitarian assistance in emergency situations , the role of the United Nations is of utmost importance in providing a proper framework for effective coordination when the international community is called upon to address difficult problems emerging from natural disasters or other phenomena of a complex nature .  
Calls upon the international community to meet all the objectives as reaffirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 5 / in particular those dealing with effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to contribute to enabling those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;

The potential for expanded economic and technical cooperation between LDCs and other developing countries merits further exploration and support by the international community , especially in view of the new opportunities emerging with the dynamic growth experience of a number of those other developing countries .  
This effectiveness may be measured by a number of different factors , including the development of new instruments , mechanisms and standards so as to respond to need , as it arises ; the effective integration of environmental and developmental issues ; implementation , monitoring and compliance ; the participation of developing countries in negotiation , implementation , review and governance ; financial and technical assistance to developing countries ; dispute avoidance and settlement ; coordination and consistency among international legal instruments ; and the identification of new and emerging issues in the field of sustainable development .  
While the largest proportion of activities fall into the traditional areas of administrative reform , training and financial systems improvement , it is increasingly common to receive requests from the field in emerging areas such as transparency , accountability , judicial and legislative administration , disaster management , electoral administration and result-oriented management based on productivity improvement .  
Specifically , to meet the urgent emerging responsibilities of training in economic management , people-centred development and public policy analysis , adequate resources need to be provided to upgrade the capacity of national training institutions , to develop a core group of professional trainers and to prepare training materials and case studies through independent research , consultancy and networking arrangements .  
As a result of discussions held at the twelfth meeting of the Group of Experts on Public Administration and Finance , organized by the Department for Development Support and Management Services , in New York , in August 1995 , it was recommended that consideration should be given to establishing training programmes addressed to the most senior levels of the civil service at national , subregional or regional levels to improve the capacity of government to deal with emerging issues of civil society for the revitalization of civil services .  
In addition , as project funding in emerging markets requires a multi-disciplined approach , including the cooperation and coordination of foreign investors , commercial banks , multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies , the multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies have supplied much needed risk mitigation through co - and re-insurance , through lending of structured finance and through provision of senior loan guarantees which have enabled private investors and local joint venture partners to invest in projects in various jurisdictions . 
The Initiative has been designed as an integrated programme intended to increase the capabilities of developing countries to compete in the emerging market for biological resources while also reducing transaction costs , increasing demand for biochemical resources , and enhancing conservation incentives .  
Provided effective support to standing political processes and relevant ad hoc processes for the development of integrated and coordinated policy responses to development issues and to emerging global problems ; for the negotiation of global agreements on norms , standards and cooperative actions ; and for the enhancement of the effectiveness of operational activities for development ;  
To create awareness of emerging human settlement policy issues arising from major global economic , social and environmental trends , in particular those arising from urbanization through the dissemination of successful and promising practices ;  
To identify new and emerging trends in the ecological , economic , social , technical and legislative spheres that influence sustainable human settlements development in the ECE region ;  
At the system level , the need for the various relevant parts of the United Nations system to establish , as soon as possible , the mechanisms to collect the essential baseline and performance data needed for the monitoring and evaluation of major programmes emerging from global conferences remains a task that is still incomplete .  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environment protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , drug prevention , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , poverty eradication , and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
This can be accomplished by educating capital markets about the investment opportunities in SFM ; by packaging and structuring these opportunities in ways that are easily understood and recognizable to private sector investors ; and by reducing risks and incremental costs specific to an emerging industry .  
At the international level , at least three activities are needed to improve coordination : ( a ) harmonization of coordination and cooperation between policy and planning frameworks at the country level to avoid confusion and overlap , ( b ) critical evaluation of emerging approaches to facilitate speedy adoption of feasible solutions and ( c ) easy access to information at international , regional , country and project levels .  
The Conference also decided that in the area of international trade , the UNCTAD technical cooperation programme should focus , inter alia , on enhancing institutional and human capacities in order for developing countries to analyse new and emerging issues and to benefit from the opportunities arising from participation in the multilateral trading system and to comply with the obligations in this respect .

The Commission noted , bearing in mind the role of the Economic and Social Council in overall coordination , that increased dialogue between the Bureau of the Commission on the Status of Women and the Economic and Social Council , the chairpersons and secretariats , as appropriate , of the other functional commissions , other subsidiary bodies and related bodies , including the relevant executive boards , would assist in identifying issues that could be addressed under the agenda item on emerging issues and trends .  
Also , both the Teledesic Corporation and Sky Station International declared that they would provide some of their telecommunications capacity free of charge to developing countries , meaning several regions and countries would have free access to some of the fastest communications available for health or educational purposes .  NULLBecause of the tremendous advances in telecommunications technology , a new global community is emerging .  
The vital contribution of the multinational Stabilization Force in providing a secure environment for the implementation of the Peace Agreement has been generally recognized , and it is particularly important that the conclusions of the Bonn Peace Implementation Conference confirmed an emerging consensus on the need for an international military presence to continue beyond June 1998 . 
At the present session of the Commission , the discussion focused on lessons learnt in the course of the ongoing exercise and on the substantive conclusions emerging from it that could guide practical follow-up activities , particularly at the country or field level , involving the United Nations system in a coherent manner in support of national plans and programmes .  
Since the late 1980s , interest in new and renewable sources of energy has begun to surge again , given the emerging concern about the environmental impacts of the growing use of fossil fuels , including their contribution to the emission of greenhouse gases , and general awareness of the need for sustainable energy systems .  
It was also agreed as to a more precise mandate for the Working Group that the uniform rules to be prepared should deal with such issues as : the legal basis supporting certification processes , including emerging digital authentication and certification technology ; the applicability of the certification process ; the allocation of risk and liabilities of users , providers and third parties in the context of the use of certification techniques ; the specific issues of certification through the use of registries ; and incorporation by reference .  
Among the questions emerging on multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , he referred to the range of policy instruments for achieving their objectives , their economic and developmental effects and the participation of developing countries in MEAs , taking into account the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities .  
This has arisen from our understanding of the mandate of the Rapporteurs as derived from the enabling resolutions , the standard terms of reference for fact-finding missions of special rapporteurs / representatives of the Commission on Human Rights , existing practice and the emerging human rights jurisprudence governing similar missions .  
Against this backdrop , the Survey is organized as follows : chapter I briefly describes how the developing ESCAP region fares in the emerging global scene ; chapter II shows the recent performance of individual countries in terms of selected macroeconomic and social development indicators which impinge on participation in the globalization and regionalization processes ; chapters III and IV analyse the benefits and risks of integration into the international and regional economy focusing on foreign trade and external finance ( including FDI ) .

The level of private capital flows to emerging markets is likely to increase further in the future , in part due to increasing pressure on pension funds and other institutional investors to diversify their investments and to the efforts of many developing countries to attract additional foreign investment .  
Despite increased flows to emerging markets , international capital flows remain highly concentrated , going from a small number of developed countries and transnational corporations to a small number of developing countries .  
The Committee agreed that the independence and extensive experience of its members in a wide range of development-related fields provided it with a comparative advantage as a forum for the discussion and review of emerging development issues facing developing countries , particularly where such issues were cross-sectoral or cut across the responsibilities of various international bodies or agencies .

In response to an initiative at the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven , a Working Party of the Group of Ten and emerging market economies is developing , with the support of all relevant institutions , a concerted international strategy to promote the establishment , adoption and implementation of sound principles and policies needed for financial stability . 
Among the contributing factors to this surge in private flows are the high growth rates experienced by many developing countries , the spread of market reforms and , in particular , the deregulation of private capital flows , the liberalization of world trade , the rise of global institutional investors and the accelerating capitalization of emerging markets and their integration into world financial markets .  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environmental protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , prevention of drug trafficking and abuse , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , eradication of poverty and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
Regarding the issue of development of Africa , he reminded the Committee that in 1993 Japan had played host to the economic summit of the seven major industrialized countries in Tokyo and had proposed a new development strategy in the context of the newly emerging realities of the post-cold-war era .  That initiative had formed the basis of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development which Japan had subsequently organized .  
The exercise of power through the application of illegal means such as unilateral actions and the imposition of coercive economic measures against other countries in order to achieve unjustifiable objectives is the prominent example of an emerging unilateralism that is extremely arrogant and self-centred , that feeds on hegemony and expansionism and that entails serious interference in the internal affairs of other countries to the point of sabotage and subversion .

Despite the anticipated upturn in capital flows , external financing will remain a major factor restraining the sustainability of strong economic growth in the medium to long run in most emerging market economies .  
While there is expected to be a further narrowing of interest-rate spreads in 2000 , any major perturbation in financial markets of developed countries , such as marked corrections in stock markets or significant increases in interest rates , could adversely affect investor sentiment towards emerging markets .  
There are various reasons for this : the lagged growth cycle in many emerging market economies ; the former high levels of interest rates in some of these countries , especially in real terms ; the greater , though still limited , degree of independence gained for monetary policy in the many countries that have embraced floating exchange-rate regimes ; and the improved international and domestic financial conditions in many countries .

Whereas some emerging economies have taken full advantage of the possibility of attracting foreign capital , most LDCs were unable to do so due to a lack of adequate macro-economic policies and to the structural weakness of their institutional and legal framework , and in particular of their financial sector , as well as to the risks resulting from the volatility of financial markets .  Capital flow liberalisation must continue .  
Progress towards sustainable development required the establishment of an international legal framework for managing deteriorating natural resources , enhanced coordination among international institutions in the environmental field , global guidance for the emerging environmental agenda and the pursuit of feasible solutions for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
With this objective in mind , ACC decided to undertake during 1999 a comprehensive assessment of the demands placed on the national and international systems by the new global environment that is emerging at the end of the twentieth century .

Specifically , to meet the urgent emerging responsibilities of training in economic management , people-centred development and public policy analysis , adequate resources need to be provided to upgrade the capacity of national training institutions , to develop a core group of professional trainers and to prepare training materials and case studies through independent research , consultancy and networking arrangements .  
As a result of discussions held at the twelfth meeting of the Group of Experts on Public Administration and Finance , organized by the Department for Development Support and Management Services , in New York , in August 1995 , it was recommended that consideration should be given to establishing training programmes addressed to the most senior levels of the civil service at national , subregional or regional levels to improve the capacity of government to deal with emerging issues of civil society for the revitalization of civil services .  
In addition , as project funding in emerging markets requires a multi-disciplined approach , including the cooperation and coordination of foreign investors , commercial banks , multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies , the multilateral and bilateral banks and agencies have supplied much needed risk mitigation through co - and re-insurance , through lending of structured finance and through provision of senior loan guarantees which have enabled private investors and local joint venture partners to invest in projects in various jurisdictions . 
The Initiative has been designed as an integrated programme intended to increase the capabilities of developing countries to compete in the emerging market for biological resources while also reducing transaction costs , increasing demand for biochemical resources , and enhancing conservation incentives .  
Provided effective support to standing political processes and relevant ad hoc processes for the development of integrated and coordinated policy responses to development issues and to emerging global problems ; for the negotiation of global agreements on norms , standards and cooperative actions ; and for the enhancement of the effectiveness of operational activities for development ;  
To create awareness of emerging human settlement policy issues arising from major global economic , social and environmental trends , in particular those arising from urbanization through the dissemination of successful and promising practices ;  
To identify new and emerging trends in the ecological , economic , social , technical and legislative spheres that influence sustainable human settlements development in the ECE region ;  
At the system level , the need for the various relevant parts of the United Nations system to establish , as soon as possible , the mechanisms to collect the essential baseline and performance data needed for the monitoring and evaluation of major programmes emerging from global conferences remains a task that is still incomplete .  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environment protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , drug prevention , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , poverty eradication , and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
This can be accomplished by educating capital markets about the investment opportunities in SFM ; by packaging and structuring these opportunities in ways that are easily understood and recognizable to private sector investors ; and by reducing risks and incremental costs specific to an emerging industry .  
At the international level , at least three activities are needed to improve coordination : ( a ) harmonization of coordination and cooperation between policy and planning frameworks at the country level to avoid confusion and overlap , ( b ) critical evaluation of emerging approaches to facilitate speedy adoption of feasible solutions and ( c ) easy access to information at international , regional , country and project levels .  
The Conference also decided that in the area of international trade , the UNCTAD technical cooperation programme should focus , inter alia , on enhancing institutional and human capacities in order for developing countries to analyse new and emerging issues and to benefit from the opportunities arising from participation in the multilateral trading system and to comply with the obligations in this respect .  
Other key events that created volatility in the currency and financial markets included the derivative losses incurred by established institutions and corporations , the Mexican financial crisis , which affected emerging markets in general , the strength of the yen against the dollar , and the continued struggle by the European Union to meet the convergence criteria for economic and monetary union .  
The AALCC has played an invaluable and historic role since the 1950s in creating a wider appreciation of international legal issues among the newly independent States of Asia and Africa , which were then emerging from long periods of colonial rule .  
Bearing in mind that Mozambique is emerging from a devastating war and that a proper response to address the current situation in the country requires substantial international assistance in a comprehensive and integrated manner and linking , inter alia , resettlement to reintegration programmes in order to strengthen further the process of national reconstruction and development ,  
The Commission noted , bearing in mind the role of the Economic and Social Council in overall coordination , that increased dialogue between the Bureau of the Commission on the Status of Women and the Economic and Social Council , the chairpersons and secretariats , as appropriate , of the other functional commissions , other subsidiary bodies and related bodies , including the relevant executive boards , would assist in identifying issues that could be addressed under the agenda item on emerging issues and trends .  
Also , both the Teledesic Corporation and Sky Station International declared that they would provide some of their telecommunications capacity free of charge to developing countries , meaning several regions and countries would have free access to some of the fastest communications available for health or educational purposes .  NULLBecause of the tremendous advances in telecommunications technology , a new global community is emerging .  
The vital contribution of the multinational Stabilization Force in providing a secure environment for the implementation of the Peace Agreement has been generally recognized , and it is particularly important that the conclusions of the Bonn Peace Implementation Conference confirmed an emerging consensus on the need for an international military presence to continue beyond June 1998 . 
At the present session of the Commission , the discussion focused on lessons learnt in the course of the ongoing exercise and on the substantive conclusions emerging from it that could guide practical follow-up activities , particularly at the country or field level , involving the United Nations system in a coherent manner in support of national plans and programmes .  
Since the late 1980s , interest in new and renewable sources of energy has begun to surge again , given the emerging concern about the environmental impacts of the growing use of fossil fuels , including their contribution to the emission of greenhouse gases , and general awareness of the need for sustainable energy systems .  
It was also agreed as to a more precise mandate for the Working Group that the uniform rules to be prepared should deal with such issues as : the legal basis supporting certification processes , including emerging digital authentication and certification technology ; the applicability of the certification process ; the allocation of risk and liabilities of users , providers and third parties in the context of the use of certification techniques ; the specific issues of certification through the use of registries ; and incorporation by reference .  
Among the questions emerging on multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , he referred to the range of policy instruments for achieving their objectives , their economic and developmental effects and the participation of developing countries in MEAs , taking into account the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities .  
This has arisen from our understanding of the mandate of the Rapporteurs as derived from the enabling resolutions , the standard terms of reference for fact-finding missions of special rapporteurs / representatives of the Commission on Human Rights , existing practice and the emerging human rights jurisprudence governing similar missions .  
Against this backdrop , the Survey is organized as follows : chapter I briefly describes how the developing ESCAP region fares in the emerging global scene ; chapter II shows the recent performance of individual countries in terms of selected macroeconomic and social development indicators which impinge on participation in the globalization and regionalization processes ; chapters III and IV analyse the benefits and risks of integration into the international and regional economy focusing on foreign trade and external finance ( including FDI ) . 
Overall Socioeconomic Perspective for the World Economy ; six working papers on selected macroeconomic issues , including changing world patterns in income distribution , relationships between economic growth and trade , the relationship between economic growth and merchandise trade , financing the social safety net in services , emerging issues in development finance in the twenty-first century and possible strategies for international development in the twenty-first century ;  
Review the salient issues in the regional strategies and action programmes emerging from recent global conferences , international conventions and agreements ; monitor the implementation of Agenda 21 at the regional level ; and articulate the region 's response to relevant global initiatives , ensuring that such initiatives support the development of the region .  
In addition , the emerging human rights norms relating to the right to development , intergenerational rights , the right to peace , and the right to a safe and healthy environment are areas in which indigenous peoples are beginning to influence old thinking and bring about the progressive development of standards that are more sensitive , responsive and useful to indigenous peoples and humankind generally .  
Such provocative actions by the separatist leaders of the Armenians in Nagorny Karabakh , at a time when positive trends are emerging towards a just and decisive resolution of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict on the basis of respect for the principles of territorial integrity of the Azerbaijani Republic and the granting of broad autonomy to Nagorny Karabakh , once again demonstrate that the separatists , consolidating the results of the aggression committed against Azerbaijan , intend to nullify the efforts of the Co-Chairmen of the Minsk group of OSCE and thereby to destroy the peacemaking process . 
To establish conditions that help the private sector to be competitive in the emerging global economy , the Governments of new or restored democracies should provide a predictable legal framework , control of corruption , high quality public service and a supportive environment .  
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist which require even more forceful and concerted action at national and international levels to achieve the goal of education for all ,  
Newly emerging phenomena , such as the possibility of long-term climate change with the expectation of disastrous effects on a global scale or , better known , periodic seasonal or geographical anomalies such as the El Ni �� Southern Oscillation phenomenon , create further uncertainties and new challenges for institutionalized warning practices .  
The proposal by Mexico to initiate a review of practical ways and means to strengthen the International Court of Justice ( A / 52 / 33 , paras . 123-130 ) deserved more detailed consideration in the light of the Courts growing workload and the emerging interest in its potential for preventive diplomacy .  115 .  Another proposal which merited further study was the suggestion by Cuba in its working paper ( A / 52 / 33 , chap .  
The projects evaluated were selected through a weighted combination of such criteria as innovative design for formulation of public policies , relevance of project strategies for programme areas and sub-offices , emerging priorities ( e.g . , child labour , AIDS ) , potential for intersectoral integration , a child rights framework , national and local impact and replicability and sustainability of results .  
In addition to the national and local levels traditionally considered , attention needs to be given to the subnational level where new approaches to participatory democracy are emerging , for example in growing cities and their rural hinterland , in river basins or groupings of neighbourhoods in mega-cities .  
He stated that with the apparent weakening of the commitment to development cooperation on the part of the traditional partners , TCDC and South-South cooperation represented the best hope for the developing countries in the context of the emerging global order , although it should not be seen as a substitute for traditional development cooperation .  
Egypt \ x { e5b8 } regional and international contributions within the framework of Africa , the Arab and Islamic worlds and the Middle East region , as well as among the developing countries and emerging economies , undoubtedly qualify it to shoulder the responsibilities of permanent membership in a new , expanded Security Council providing balanced and equitable representation .  
While our strong commitment to social policy has paid rich dividends , as illustrated by the successive high rankings of Barbados in the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) human development index , emerging problems largely associated with poverty , particularly among youth , are of critical concern .  
The interdependence of the situation emerging in Central Asia , the common European security system taking shape and the outlook for developing situations within the vast Asian continent means there is an urgent need for the international community to take measures to ensure durable peace and stability in this region along with its sustainable development .  
While it is important to act with determination and caution , on the one hand , it is , on the other , vital to know how to innovate by implementing mechanisms that can support emerging models , consolidating the global and intersectoral dimension of youth policies in close coordination with national , regional and local authorities while not ignoring the various social actors , including young people .  
The purpose was to begin to create a new human being with stronger moral values and principles , a human being who is more tolerant of differences , more productive economically , with ideals , loyalty and virtue in political matters and embracing social unity ; in sum , to try to alter elements that are deeply rooted in a population , as well as those that are emerging .  
The level of private capital flows to emerging markets is likely to increase further in the future , in part due to increasing pressure on pension funds and other institutional investors to diversify their investments and to the efforts of many developing countries to attract additional foreign investment .  
Despite increased flows to emerging markets , international capital flows remain highly concentrated , going from a small number of developed countries and transnational corporations to a small number of developing countries .  
The Committee agreed that the independence and extensive experience of its members in a wide range of development-related fields provided it with a comparative advantage as a forum for the discussion and review of emerging development issues facing developing countries , particularly where such issues were cross-sectoral or cut across the responsibilities of various international bodies or agencies .  
In its resolution 1996 / 51 , the Commission requested the High Commissioner for Human Rights to prepare , within existing resources , and submit to the Commission at its fifty _ third session an update of the report of the Secretary-General on human rights and mass exoduses ( E / CN . 4 / 1996 / 42 ) , including information on and recommendations and conclusions emerging from the action taken pursuant to that resolution , as well as all relevant information on the human rights situations creating or affecting refugees and displaced persons .  
At the dawn of a new millennium we are all indignant witnesses to a rebirth and recrudescence of racist propaganda , incitement to ethnic hatred , and practices betraying feelings of racial and xenophobic superiority and exclusivity while at the same time extreme _ rightist political organizations and neo _ Nazi parties are emerging in developed societies and operating with complete impunity .  
To summarize , ESCWA countries are facing a vast number of emerging challenges involving labour market problems related to labour absorption ; the restructuring of education ; the creation of productive employment opportunities ; structural imbalances in the labour market of each country ; underemployment in the public sector ; rehabilitation of the unemployed , especially those who suffered from long-term unemployment ; integration of new entrants to the labour markets , especially youth ; restructuring and downsizing of the public sector ; and increasing pressures to pursue market-based growth paths and to open to the global economy .  
The following important common policy approaches are emerging in the promotion of SARD : ( a ) the use of economic incentives to guide sustainable agricultural practices ; ( b ) education and information exchange for human development ; ( c ) the development and transfer of new and appropriate technologies ; ( d ) farm and off-farm employment for alleviating poverty ; ( e ) sound natural resource management leading to environmental protection ; and ( f ) focusing on men and women farmers themselves .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s , ( b ) the potential positive role that transnational corporations could play in conjunction with Governments in achieving global goals on emission standards , and ( c ) the continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .

It was indicated that the initial assumptions had been somewhat optimistic and that slower programming and low implementation is also attributable to the fact that increasingly projects are supported only by earmarked contributions , limiting UNDCP 's flexibility to be responsive to emerging priorities .  
The Division will analyse and develop as required policy issues in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and produce major reports and documents such as United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems , the global report on crime and justice and the international study on firearm regulation , as well as analytical reports of the Secretary-General on the thematic issues before the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and on emerging trends and new approaches to issues affecting the situation in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to invite Governments , intergovernmental organizations , specialized agencies and non _ governmental organizations to provide information and to prepare , within existing resources , and submit to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session an update of his report , including information on and recommendations and conclusions emerging from the action taken pursuant to the present resolution , with particular attention to defining appropriate early _ warning capacities and ensuing implementation procedures and activities necessary to respond promptly and effectively ;  
For the three years 1993-1995 , total equity investment flows , including quasi-equities like convertible bonds and bonds with equity warrants , were equivalent to nearly half the FDI flows to developing countries and countries in transition [ 1 ] .  The surge in equity investment in emerging markets took place against a background of structural changes in international capital markets and in the economies of recipient countries .  
For countries that have reached a low level of fertility , a new pattern of fertility , similar to the one observed in the West , is emerging , in that childbearing appears to be concentrated in the central age groups of reproductive span .  
Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to invite Governments , intergovernmental organizations , specialized agencies and non _ governmental organizations to provide information and to prepare , within existing resources , and submit to the Commission at its fifty _ fourth session an update of his report , including information on and recommendations and conclusions emerging from the action taken pursuant to the present resolution , with particular attention to defining appropriate early _ warning capacities and ensuing implementation procedures and activities necessary to respond promptly and effectively ;  
This is also necessary for an optimal combination with emerging satellite systems , which are complementary to terrestrial systems and fundamental for the rapid global expansion of services .  
In the light of new and emerging challenges , faced with conflicting situations , the ordinary citizens of the world yearn for peace and security and aspire towards economic equity and participation in meeting their basic needs and an opportunity to live in comfort . 
Despite the difficulties that some developing countries had had in expressing their views on the topic , a consensus seemed to be emerging that a permanent , universally accepted and independent court should be established by means of an international treaty , that the court should have jurisdiction over the most serious crimes , and that the principles of criminal law and procedural aspects must be incorporated in the statute .  
The strengthened multilateral trading system emerging from the Uruguay Round is expected to contribute to more effective surveillance and to strict observance of multilaterally agreed rules and disciplines so that trade policy can play a more substantial role in ensuring the coherence of global economic policy-making . 
In response to an initiative at the Lyon Summit of the Group of Seven , a Working Party of the Group of Ten and emerging market economies is developing , with the support of all relevant institutions , a concerted international strategy to promote the establishment , adoption and implementation of sound principles and policies needed for financial stability . 
Among the contributing factors to this surge in private flows are the high growth rates experienced by many developing countries , the spread of market reforms and , in particular , the deregulation of private capital flows , the liberalization of world trade , the rise of global institutional investors and the accelerating capitalization of emerging markets and their integration into world financial markets .  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environmental protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , prevention of drug trafficking and abuse , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , eradication of poverty and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
Regarding the issue of development of Africa , he reminded the Committee that in 1993 Japan had played host to the economic summit of the seven major industrialized countries in Tokyo and had proposed a new development strategy in the context of the newly emerging realities of the post-cold-war era .  That initiative had formed the basis of the Tokyo International Conference on African Development which Japan had subsequently organized .  
The exercise of power through the application of illegal means such as unilateral actions and the imposition of coercive economic measures against other countries in order to achieve unjustifiable objectives is the prominent example of an emerging unilateralism that is extremely arrogant and self-centred , that feeds on hegemony and expansionism and that entails serious interference in the internal affairs of other countries to the point of sabotage and subversion .  
Multilateral and bilateral assistance seems to be driving market growth at present , much as in the rest of the developing world , although provincial and municipal governments are emerging as legitimate customers for environmental service providers .  
The Department had given special attention to the emerging role of civilian police in peacekeeping operations , which represented a new dimension of the efforts to respond effectively to the complex problems posed by civil conflict .  
Conflicts based on ethnic , religious or cultural grounds are still emerging in many parts of our planet , claiming innocent lives and precious resources , while the race in military expenditures knows no bounds .  
Future efforts by international organizations , multilateral institutions and instruments should be flexible in order to accommodate existing and emerging needs , as well as the different levels of social and economic development of countries , in particular developing countries .  
It has also formulated a proposal for a project whose main objective is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness .  
UNDP is providing support to emerging governance and administrative structures at the highest possible level ( community , district , or regional ) for economic and social rehabilitation and reintegration in both rural and urban settings .  
Nevertheless , it seems to the Committee that it might be helpful for the working group to take stock of recent developments and to reassess its approach in light of these changing circumstances , with a view to providing a very valuable opportunity for the international community to ensure that the overall approach which is emerging is optimal .  
Provision of valid and reliable data and information , including statistical data , findings and results of action-oriented research and high-quality analysis and updated information on structures and activities of major and emerging transnational organized criminal groups , on illicit markets and on trends and patterns in the trafficking of human beings and corruption ;  
Provision of valid and reliable data and information , statistics , findings and results of action-oriented research , including high-quality analysis of and updated information on structures and activities of major and emerging transnational organized criminal groups , on illicit markets and on trends and patterns in the trafficking of human beings and in corruption ;  
Such a mechanism should be written into the rules and conditions governing international financial contracts , in order to promote a better assessment of risks , eliminate irresponsible behaviour and reduce speculative short-term capital flows to emerging markets . 
There will be increased understanding of crime trends and emerging challenges in crime prevention and criminal justice , improved expertise for Member States to draw upon and enhanced international cooperation in addressing crime prevention and criminal justice concerns that require a concerted international response .  
In collaboration with appropriate United Nations and external partners , the subprogramme will alert the world to emerging problems by initiating periodic assessments of priority environmental issues , strengthening linkages to global and national environmental observation programmes and helping to provide authoritative information for policy formulation and implementation . 
Provision of up-to-date and relevant information on emerging regional and global issues and potential environmental threats likely to lead to potential conflicts , critical hot spots or emergency situations , as a basis for formulating potential strategic and collaborative responses in a timely manner ;  
Reflection and presentation of a timely , accurate , appropriate image of UNEP through systematic dissemination of targeted information on the environmental agenda and initiatives to enlist audience support through the media , and assistance in mobilizing adequate international response to major emerging environmental issues ;  
Having committed themselves to a domestically based strategy to achieving more balanced growth , reducing imbalances and supporting recovery in emerging market economies , the Group also pledged strong cooperation to promote stability of the international monetary system and announced the launching of a financial stability forum to help avert future global crisis . 
That assumption was proved false in the Russian case , and consequently there were considerable fears in SeptemberOctober of a global recession being triggered by the falls in stock prices and the threat of a credit crunch as credit conditions were tightened significantly , not only for borrowers in emerging markets but also in developed market economies , such as the United States , where the spreads over United States Treasury Bills for corporate borrowing rose significantly .  
South / South cooperation , including TCDC and ECDC , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and equitable development and for ensuring their more effective participation in the newly emerging global economic system .  
National and bilateral TCDC activities during the reporting period clearly indicate that an increasing number of developing countries are emerging as key proponents of the TCDC process , assuming leadership roles in promoting , organizing and funding bilateral and regional TCDC-related projects as part of their annual commitment to trade , investment and international cooperation activities .  
The 1999 World Survey provides a synoptic and statistical outline of the current economic and social status of women and of some emerging trends in the 12 critical areas of concern of the Platform for Action . 2 Based on existing data , it highlights the areas where visible progress has been achieved , compared to the situation three decades ago . 
The objectives of the report were to make UNU an integral part of the United Nations renewal process ; to explore ways by which its potential could be realized more fully as a strategic intellectual resource for the multilateral system of cooperation ; and to strengthen its adaptability to the emerging or uncharted challenges of the next century .  
Also calls upon Governments , international financial institutions and the private sector to consider the possibility of cancelling or reducing significantly the debt of the heavily _ indebted poor countries , giving priority to countries emerging from devastating civil wars or that have been devastated by natural disasters ;  
New procedures enabling the delivery of debt relief more rapidly and to a larger group of beneficiaries will indeed be essential for solving the debt overhang problems of the poor , heavily indebted countries in sub-Saharan Africa ; and special arrangements are required for those emerging from civil war and strife and presenting exceptional economic rehabilitation assistance needs .  
Under the overall goal of assisting the understanding by the international community of emerging challenges and persistent problems in global development , the objective proposed is to achieve more informed and broad-based economic and social policy-making in Africa at the national level , through a network of development expertise on the region .  
Under the overall objective of assisting developing countries to address emerging challenges and persistent problems , the objective of this project is to strengthen the capacity of research institutions in developing countries to conduct development policy analysis , particularly in the examination of changes in domestic economic conditions and of regional and international developments that have a bearing on them .  
The work of the various thematic groups , organized around specific cross-cutting themes emerging from the international programmes , should now be further integrated to ensure a more comprehensive approach to conference follow-up , facilitating the development of a corresponding integrated follow-up at the national level .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and equitable development and for ensuring their effective participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
They also continue a good record of cooperation with the Department in the area of research and policy analyses , and collaborate in monitoring and analysing the emerging global and regional trends and macroeconomic policies in their respective major publications , namely , the World Economic Survey and the regional economic and social surveys .  
Net private capital flows to emerging markets in 1999 barely increased from the low levels of 1998 , when flows contracted to less than half of their pre-crisis peak , but have been recovering modestly since mid-1999 . 
Despite the anticipated upturn in capital flows , external financing will remain a major factor restraining the sustainability of strong economic growth in the medium to long run in most emerging market economies .  
While there is expected to be a further narrowing of interest-rate spreads in 2000 , any major perturbation in financial markets of developed countries , such as marked corrections in stock markets or significant increases in interest rates , could adversely affect investor sentiment towards emerging markets .  
There are various reasons for this : the lagged growth cycle in many emerging market economies ; the former high levels of interest rates in some of these countries , especially in real terms ; the greater , though still limited , degree of independence gained for monetary policy in the many countries that have embraced floating exchange-rate regimes ; and the improved international and domestic financial conditions in many countries . 
It also assumes that international financial institutions and bilateral donors would demonstrate greater flexibility in the granting of loans to countries emerging from conflicts , where the entire administrative , economic and social infrastructures have very often been destroyed .  
Requests the funds and programmes to submit to the Council through their executive boards information and analyses of the extent to which the cross-cutting themes and goals emerging from global conferences have been integrated into their programme priorities in a coherent manner , as well as on specific steps taken to develop complementary and collaborative approaches with other United Nations organizations in promoting the implementation of global targets ;  
The definition and promotion of concepts for a flexible technical infrastructure , adaptable to health services in different economic and cultural environments , including developing countries , and based on a clear vision of the existing and the emerging growth of telecommunications and information-processing capabilities ;  
At the inter-agency level , ongoing measures to enhance programme complementarity need to be accompanied by a renewed effort at identifying and focusing on common priority objectives and priority themes ; developing joint arrangements to respond to emerging requirements ; and concerting overall policies and strategies . 
Targeted sanctions are a less blunt instrument than comprehensive sanctions , thereby minimizing humanitarian costs , the disruption of non-military trade , the likelihood of a black market emerging , additional humanitarian aid requirements and a negative impact on social infrastructures .  
UNIFEM is committed to intensifying support for programmes that link micro-level and macro-level practical and policy actions in its three thematic areas to meet emerging needs and priorities for gender mainstreaming and for building the capacity of womens organizations as economic and political actors .  
" The Security Council is deeply concerned that countries involved in , emerging from , or close to protracted armed conflicts are particularly vulnerable to violence resulting from the indiscriminate use of small arms in armed conflict .  
The main objective of the global studies on transnational organized crime is to assess the major and emerging groups involved in transnational organized crime according to their level of dangerousness and to determine the scope of the various illegal markets within which they operate .  
The need for an integrated and coherent policy response to the existing and emerging environmental challenges is mirrored in UNEPs integrated organizational structure and work programme , which is based on environmental monitoring , assessment , information and research , including early warning ; enhanced coordination of environmental conventions and development of environment policy instruments ; freshwater activities ; technology transfer and industry ; and support to Africa .  
Mr . President , even at this late stage , Pakistan is committed to pursuing contacts and consultations with all the members of the international community in order to evolve a broadly agreed approach to deal with the threats to regional and global peace and security emerging from Indias political and military ambitions as revealed in its nuclear doctrine .  
Africas heavy dependence on primary commodity exports ( accounting for about 80 per cent of total export earnings ) is evidence of the low level of human resource development and limited technological capability to take advantage of emerging trade and investment opportunities .  
Through renewed support for IDDA , efforts must be intensified to reduce the gap between those with knowledge and skills and those without , as well as to facilitate foreign and domestic private sector investment in the value chain of primary products and other manufacturing activities in order to address the emerging problems of the technology gap , urban unemployment and rural poverty .  
The Security Council is deeply concerned that countries involved in , emerging from , or close to protracted armed conflicts are particularly vulnerable to violence resulting from the indiscriminate use of small arms in armed conflict .  
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist , which require even more forceful and concerted action at the national and international levels so as to achieve the goal of education for all ,  
Improved policy-making and development of effective global , regional and national agendas to respond to current and emerging environmental challenges through the availability of integrated global assessments and reports that analyse the state of the global environment , identify global and regional environmental trends and provide early warning information on environmental threats ;  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Moreover , the global and in many places local environment is deteriorating because of unsustainable production and consumption patterns typically linked either to extreme poverty in developing countries or to the lack of sufficiently internalising environmental costs in market prices in developed countries and emerging economies .  
Whereas some emerging economies have taken full advantage of the possibility of attracting foreign capital , most LDCs were unable to do so due to a lack of adequate macro-economic policies and to the structural weakness of their institutional and legal framework , and in particular of their financial sector , as well as to the risks resulting from the volatility of financial markets .  Capital flow liberalisation must continue .  
Progress towards sustainable development required the establishment of an international legal framework for managing deteriorating natural resources , enhanced coordination among international institutions in the environmental field , global guidance for the emerging environmental agenda and the pursuit of feasible solutions for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
With this objective in mind , ACC decided to undertake during 1999 a comprehensive assessment of the demands placed on the national and international systems by the new global environment that is emerging at the end of the twentieth century .  
Recognizing that , despite the significant progress in basic education , especially the increase in primary school enrolment coupled with a growing emphasis on the quality of education , major problems , both emerging and continuing , still persist , which require even more forceful and concerted action at the national and international levels so as to achieve the goal of education for all ,  
International financial markets and rapid capital movement drained financial resources from newly emerging economies through currency speculation , and huge transfers of resources from the developing to the developed economies continued unchecked .  
There were several reported attempts to disrupt the activities of emerging or newly constituted groups , the most egregious example of which was the disruption by pro-Aristide demonstrators of a rally , on 28 May 1999 , organized by the private sector and supported by a wide spectrum of civil society organizations and political parties to protest mounting insecurity and what they termed anarchy .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,
