An international enabling environment also requires coordination of macroeconomic policies by the international community which foster conditions of stability , predictability and growth in the world economy , stable exchange rates , low interest rates and low fiscal deficits , as well as trade liberalization , more equitable access of developing countries to global markets , an increased flow of productive investments , technologies and knowledge to developing countries , and new and additional financial resources from all sources .  
An essential component of an enabling environment for development is sound national macroeconomic policies and the creation of favourable conditions for investment and increased domestic savings , including through the creation of a sound banking system .  
An open , rule-based , equitable , secure , non-discriminatory , transparent and predictable multilateral trading system is a key element in fostering an enabling environment for development and is also essential for deepening the flow of technology and information around the world .  
This programme comprises , mainly , the organized transfer of meteorological and hydrological knowledge and proven methodology among the members of the organization , with the overall objective of enabling the national meteorological and hydrological services of members States , especially the least developed and other developing countries , to provide the best possible level of services so as to ensure public safety , management of water resources , support sustainable socio-economic development and safeguard the environment .  
The motor of that process was the promotion of an enabling environment that would ensure increased access for the poor to economic services and industrial goods , given that the great majority of poor people in rural areas were self-employed and that their prosperity depended on their having direct access to more and improved means of production .  
Kenya appreciated the role of UNIDO in industrial development cooperation and concurred with the Secretary-General that developing countries increasingly required the policy advisory and capacity-building services of UNIDO in support of their endeavours to create an enabling environment for sustainable industrial growth and international competitiveness .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities that complement and reinforce national objectives .

The Commission concludes that Governments and other organizations should work together with UNCTAD to create an enabling environment for micro finance institutions ( MFIs ) and that to work with MFIs in mobilizing funds from sources such as the international financial market is timely and important .  * As agreed at the Commissions third ( closing ) plenary meeting on 5 December 1997 .  
The Commission considers that the work undertaken by the UNCTAD secretariat in demonstrating to international private investors that micro finance represents an important potential market for investment , and UNCTADs efforts in creating and enhancing awareness among member States of the enabling environment for micro finance institutions , should be pursued in close cooperation with the competent bodies of the United Nations and other international organizations in this field , including existing national initiatives .  
Emphasizes that the Business Plan marks a watershed in the history of the Organization , defines activities to be undertaken by the Organization in future , reinforces the continuation of UNIDO in global forum functions and in areas where UNIDO has comparative advantage , enabling it to function as a specialized agency within the United Nations system in the field of industrial development for supporting the endeavours of developing countries and those in transition to achieve sustainable development ;  
Stressing , given the fact that much of the most advanced environmentally sound technology is developed and held by the private sector , that the creation of an enabling environment on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries , as affirmed by the General Assembly in paragraph 90 of the annex to its resolution S / 19-2 of 28 June 1997 ,  
Recognizes the important role of Governments in creating , through transparent and participatory processes , an enabling environment supportive of entrepreneurship and facilitative of privatization , in particular in establishing the judicial , executive and legislative frameworks necessary for a market-based exchange of goods and services and for good management ;  
The White Paper also sets out the role of the central Government in providing the right conditions for public and private investment through management of the overall economy , and local authorities will be encouraged to take a strategic enabling approach in respect of all housing tenures and a reduced role as landlords .  
The Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) realized early in the preparatory process that even though many countries had revised their national shelter policies and had embarked on the process of implementation of enabling shelter strategies , the objective of adequate shelter for all could not be achieved by the year 2000 in the large majority of the developing countries .  
But I feel that it is appropriate to repeat the principal characteristic of our development model , which is a harmonious and rational complementary relationship between economic and social policies , which for the first time in many years is enabling us to carry out a realistic strategy for sustainable human development .  
It is about creating an enabling government and an enabling environment in which the ordinary person the impoverished , the disillusioned , the educated and the rich feels included and feels that he or she can participate in the decision-making process and feels that his or her dreams can be truly realized .  
For meaningful development to take root in the developing countries , an enabling international environment should be established which can address such issues as macroeconomic stability , more open trade regimes in developed countries , stable financial systems , reasonable debt initiatives , such as those proposed under the World Bank 's Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative , and greater financial flows from developed countries to the developing countries .  
Since our Secretary-General presented his proposals for reform in July , the Central American countries have expressed firm support for his ideas about a modern , efficient , nimble Organization with better coordination in line with current administrative and financial trends , an Organization enabling us , without further delay , to move from lofty aspirations to real actions that will help everybody , especially those in developing countries , which comprise the overwhelming majority of the members of this body .  
That process was expected to result in the preparation of a comprehensive and balanced document to address both security and humanitarian aspects of the problem , and to make provisions for financial support and the transfer of relevant advanced technology to affected countries , enabling those States to overcome this serious problem .  
The Note outlined several elements indispensable in protection-based comprehensive approaches to avoiding mass displacement , such as upholding the international rule of law , including relevant human rights and refugee law principles , which should be seen as positive and enabling components of any comprehensive approach .  
The programme of the workshop covered four main topics : conceptual issues of poverty in old age ; women as one of the groups at risk , and the process known as the feminization of poverty ; specific issues of poverty among other groups at risk ; disabled and single persons ; and ways to create an enabling environment for the improved well-being of older people .  
Those objectives are set out relative to the following five programme areas : ( a ) increasing the availability of food , feed and renewable raw materials ; ( b ) improving human health ; ( c ) enhancing protection of the environment ; ( d ) enhancing safety and developing international mechanisms for cooperation ; and ( e ) establishing enabling mechanisms for the development and environmentally sound application of biotechnology .

By enabling the Serbian ethnic community living in the region under the present United Nations Transitional Administration to set up and administer a unique zupanija within the sovereign Croatian State as a form of local self-government or administration or as any other form of organization of that level and meaning in future ;  
That framework covered the creation of an enabling global environment for employment growth , policies to enhance the adaptability of the labour market and the efficient use of human resources applicable to countries at all levels of development , as well as policies specific to developing , transition , and industrialized countries .  
These experiments are aimed at laying the practical foundations for enabling human beings to spend prolonged periods of time under conditions of space flight ( studies on radiation safety , strain on the human support and locomotive system , determination of the mechanisms involved in vestibular disorders and changes in the cardiovascular system , and development of methods for their prevention or treatment ) .  
That State further observed that all current and future aerospace vehicles had a common denominator in that such objects were designed to travel using both aeronautical and astronautical properties , thereby enabling them to fly in airspace and move in outer space .  
Past experience , together with results from expert group meetings and the interactive dialogues to be held during the Commission in 1997 , may serve as a basis for identifying measures which could help to accelerate progress in achieving equality between men and women in the critical areas of concern identified at Beijing as crucial for eliminating discrimination against women and enabling women around the world to fully enjoy their human rights .  
As a result of Beijing , a new emphasis has been placed on enabling women to be active decision makers , planners and designers of projects for sustainable development , particularly at the local level ; improving access of women to skills through expansion of extension services and training in science , technology and economics and developing gender-sensitive databases and integrating traditional knowledge of women into resource management programmes .  
This role was manifested at two levels : at the macro level in terms of creating an enabling environment , good macroeconomic policies , a sound legal , regulatory and tax framework and political stability ; and at the micro level inter alia through providing appropriate support measures and structures and investing in capacity _ building , including in the areas of education , training and health .  It could create an environment in which the private sector knew what was happening .  
Creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private-sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .  
The role of UNEP and its Governing Council , as the principal United Nations body in the field of environment , should be further enhanced , in conformity with the Nairobi Declaration on the Role and Mandate of UNEP , 20 with a view to enabling UNEP to serve as the leading environmental authority that sets the global environmental agenda , promotes the coherent implementation of the environmental dimension of sustainable development within the United Nations system , and acts as an authoritative advocate for the global environment .  
While it was recognized that an enabling environment for women 's participation in the economy was required at the national level , it was also noted that the international level should not be overlooked because of its impact on women and the national economic situation .  
Reaffirming that a peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication ,  
The Commission will review progress made in the implementation and follow-up of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , and will consider at each of its sessions issues relating to the enabling environment for social development , the special situation of Africa and the least developed countries , the enhancement of social development goals in structural adjustment programmes , the mobilization of domestic and international resources for social development , and the framework for international , regional and subregional cooperation for social development .  
Recognizes the important role of Governments in creating , through transparent and participatory processes , an enabling environment supportive of entrepreneurship and facilitative of privatization , in particular in establishing the judicial , executive and legislative frameworks necessary for a market-based exchange of goods and services and for good management ;  
The top-down approach seeks to create an enabling or " fostering " environment , which provides the right incentives for small firms , together with enough positive support and protection ( e.g . against unfair practices of larger competitors ) to allow such firms to make the best of their potential . 4 The top-down approach seeks to improve the business environment by operating on macroeconomic variables such as prices , government regulations and policies , by providing legislation and enforcement , and by building up the physical infrastructure . 
In resolution 1997 / 33 , on the protection of human rights in the context of human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , States were urged , in collaboration and through the community , to promote a supportive and enabling environment for women , children and other vulnerable groups , by addressing underlying prejudices and inequalities through community dialogue , specially designed social and health services , and support community groups .  
An enabling environment , understood in its broadest sense , encompasses the whole panoply of national and international policies , measures and institutions in the economic , social , legal and political domains that influence or affect the growth and development prospects of a country .  
Fostering an enabling environment for development implies a concerted effort by Governments at the national and international levels , in collaboration with other actors in development , to ensure that the interplay among those policies , measures and institutions and the sum total of their impact promotes not only sustained economic growth but a development style that is sustainable and broad-based and whose benefits are shared equitably by all members of society .  
The key characteristics of an enabling environment are well understood and generally accepted : stability , predictability , adaptability , growth orientation , transparent legal and regulatory frameworks , and a strong base of social and physical infrastructures .  
The broad elements of an enabling international environment for development are essentially the same as those that are relevant at the national level : creation and maintenance of peaceful and stable international conditions ; democratization in international relations , establishment of open , fair , equitable and transparent international regimes ; respect for and non-discriminatory application of the rules of the game so as to create equal opportunities and a level playing field for all ; and protection of the weakest and the most vulnerable members of the international community through more favourable treatment in trade and finance .  
The first was a comprehensive study on the implementation of existing extraterritorial laws enabling States to take legal action against their residents in cases of sexual abuse of children committed abroad .  
The objective of the Task Force on an Enabling Environment for Economic and Social Development is to establish a synthesis of best practices or lessons learned in order to clarify the elements of an enabling environment for economic and social development , establish mechanisms for improving inter-agency coordination in support of such an environment , and provide respective constituents with standardized inter-agency performance indicators of social and economic progress that represent the development agenda reflected in the outcome of the major conferences .  
The objective of the case studies was to examine the role of the United Nations system agencies in assisting countries to create an appropriate macroeconomic and social framework , which would entail exploring instances where the successful development of an enabling environment had been enhanced through United Nations system agency support and inter-agency coordination , or where the lack of such coordination proved to be detrimental . 
The State has the overall responsibility in various areas , including , inter alia , social , economic and environmental policy formulation , and for creating an enabling environment for the private sector ; the State should encourage effective participation by the private sector and major groups in activities which complement and reinforce national objectives .  
The State has overall responsibility for policy formulation in the economic , social and environmental spheres , including the correction of market failures , the provision of public goods , the creation of a favourable enabling environment for the private sector as well as a favourable legal and regulatory framework . 
While it is not for the Government itself to build or finance the housing units required to satisfy all of the demand in the country , it should make every effort to ensure that a fair share of the resources available is utilized for making low _ cost housing available to the most disadvantaged and vulnerable sectors of society , and enabling the private sector to contribute to that endeavour .  
Governments should focus on being enabling partners and facilitators by creating and strengthening effective partnerships with a broad spectrum of national and grass-roots groups including local authorities , the private sector , non-governmental organizations , women 's and youth groups and the scientific and academic communities .  
The Agenda then tied poverty eradication to the objective agreed at the social development summit , namely " enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work " .  
Practical solutions were offered in the areas of employment-intensive investment policies , harnessing the productive capacity of the urban informal sector , creating an enabling regulatory environment for enterprise development and forging new public and private-sector alliances for employment creation at the local level .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
The creation of an enabling environment , on the part of both developed and developing countries , including supportive economic and fiscal measures , as well as a practical system of environmental regulations and compliance mechanisms , can help to stimulate private sector investment in and transfer of environmentally sound technology to developing countries .
