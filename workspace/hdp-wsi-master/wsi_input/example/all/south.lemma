Its leaves are oval and light green in tint . The long stem runs to 60 centimeters .  
Planning an Itinerary : Most major travel destinations are south of Shihtiping . For this reason , it is best to lay an emphasis on visiting the central and southern portions of the east coast , whether traveling by private vehicle or by public transport . Be sure to plan for a journey of at least three days and two nights .  
In recent years the many new galleries springing up in the south have stressed natural subject matter , and bright and intense colors , quite different from the cool style of northern Taiwan .  
Five years later the low wall around the city had been completed , and artillery placements were added to all four gates ( north , south , east , and west ) to ward off attacks from indigenous peoples or foreign military units . The internal and external walls were each twenty feet thick , and there was a moat around the outside . Such was China 's southernmost county seat .  
A magic time machineThe tale begins two hundred years ago with a great flood that visited the old Penkang River ( now known as the Peikang River ) . An ancient village situated along the river was completely inundated , and the inhabitants were forced to flee , some moving north , others moving south .  
There can be few among the travellers hurrying north or south along the section of the freeway between Tai-an and Sanyi who are not struck by the sudden appearance of this desolate , barren scenery where plain meets plateau , as they pass by the Taan River and Huoyan Mountains . As far as the eye can see , there is no sign of human activity , apart from the matchbox-like gravel trucks on the river embankments .  
" The ' huachung ' [ or central Chinese climate ] zone of mainland China and the ' huanan ' [ or southern Chinese climate ] zone divide just about at the Ta-an River . To the north , where the rains are heavy , the settlers built wooden structures offering strong protection against the rain . It 's drier to the south , so there they built cool and shady bamboo structures . " And the abundance of rocks strewn on the bed of the Ta-an River led to their use in the embankments between rice paddies .  
Professor B . J . Habibie , Indonesia 's State Minister for Research and Technology , has said publicly : " At some stage Singapore , with its limited natural and human resources but rapid economic growth , is certain to reach a critical pressure , just like a balloon ; and Batam , 20km south of Singapore , is ready to catch the balloon which will be squeezed out of Singapore 's balloon . "  
At this time the autumn farming activities went into a phase of decline , and in the north the weather turned cold . There was always some fear that barbarian tribes might " descend south to graze their horses . " At this time everyone began to brush up on their martial skills , even actively going out to kill the barbarians or steal the fat horses and goats that they raised !  
However , from the 17th century onwards , wave after wave of immigrants flooded onto this peaceful , happy land through the harbor at Tainan , encroaching on the Sirayas ' living space . Those Siraya who did not retreat further and further south or into the mountains accepted the rule of the incoming political authority and were subsequently assimilated .  
A 19th century English naturalist , exploring the clear waters and sharp cliffs , recorded the stunning impression these imposing precipices by the sea made on him : " The Portuguese must have first seen this island from the north or the south , for if they had seen it from the east , they would not have chosen a word as mundane as ' beautiful ' to describe it . "  
The common saying goes , " Mild in the south , salty in the north , sour in the east , and spicy in the west . " The food of Fujian , which lies in the south of China , is best known for its light , fresh flavor .  
Later , during the Wei and Chin dynasties , and during the period of the division of the country into north and south , the " nine official ranks system " was adopted , further consolidating the feudal system . It was said that " No poor families could attain high rank , and no wealthy families would be given low rank . "  
It is the dangers posed to juvenile deer by wild dogs that causes concern . Nevertheless , today with human footsteps covering every stretch of the land , it is impossible to let the deer go completely wild . Not wanting to put all their eggs in one basket , project personnel hope to select repopulation locales in northern , eastern and southern Taiwan . Since they have been operating in Kenting ( in the south ) for 12 years now , Yangming-shan National Park ( in the north ) is being considered as the second locale .  
He was said to have " strokes of iron and hooks of silver , " that is , a perfect modulation between the bold and the delicate . Wang Xizhi , of the Eastern Jin , which fled south from the encroachment of invaders , displayed a helpless yet defiant vital force through his calligraphy .  
The saying goes that " tangerines grown beyond the Huai River are small and dry . " Tangerines and oranges need the humid climate and fertile soils of the south to produce fragrant , sweet and juicy fruits . If they are transplanted north of the Huai River ( which flows West to East halfway between the Yangtze and the Yellow River ) , the soil and climate do n't suit them , and they only produce dry and undersized fruits .  
Spreading out the map of Taiwan , we see how the Tanshui River system spreads across northern Taiwan like a gigantic hand . Of its two major tributaries , the Pei-shih River in the north is cut off halfway by the high Feitsui Dam , while the Tahan River to the south is blocked by the Shih-men Dam . These structures have created two enormous artificial lakes , which supply one of life 's most basic necessities to a third of Taiwan 's population .  
In October last year it was reported that Taichung Station was to be moved underground , and that the old station building , which dates from the Japanese occupation era , might be demolished . The RCS joined with several other cultural and historical associations to put on a campaign to plead for the life of the 80-year-old station , including an event in which groups rode trains from both north and south to meet in Taichung . Finally they managed to get the station building designated a Grade 2 national monument by the Ministry of the Interior .  
Driving south along the freeway , you leave behind moist northern Taiwan and reach the Huoyan Mountains of Miaoli County . This dry , barren land presents a scene of nothing but landslip-scarred brown earth . But the cold windward upper slopes of the mountains are the lonely stronghold of the " minority people " among Taiwan 's pines-the masson pine ( Pinus massoniana ) .  
A woman who held a master 's degree married a husband who came from the rural south . On the first day of the marriage , in the kitchen of her motherinlaw 's rustic house , she faced a mountain of dirty dishes left behind by the visiting guests and relatives . She washed dishes until she cried .  
Guatemala is more than 108,800 square kilometers in area . The land is high in the south but low in the north . Guatemala City , located in the middle of the country , stands at an elevation of 1,500 meters above sea level . Its climate is cool , almost as if it were naturally air-conditioned .  
The poet Alexander Pope was an early enthusiast for the Chinese view of nature and , with the help of Burlington , built a small garden on the bank of the winding Thames river in the south London suburbs . It had no fence , parallel paths or symmetrical flower beds . He planned to make it a place where he could engage in literary and artistic pursuits .  
Kun Opera , which derives its name from the Kunshan area of Jiangsu Province , where it first came into popularity , has one style of tune . As early as the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties , it was recognized as one form of southern song . This period was one of intense political , economic and cultural development in the south .  
It began with the late-Yuan Emperor Shun , who favored the south and moved the empire 's political center there . By the Ming dynasty , the scenic southern banks of the Yangtze River were also home to booming trade and a flowering of the arts which saw frequent performances of music and dance .  
Oblivious to the traffic thundering across the Yungfu and Chungcheng bridges , which connect the south side of Taipei City with Taipei County , the ducks forage among the cattails and turn up algae , quite in keeping with their nature . There is none of the jostling and bickering of domestic ducks raised in pens . Against the distant roar of the traffic , the birds ' occasional calls from the sandbars lend a strange serenity to the scene , imparting a sense of harmony and grace rarely seen in this bustling metropolis .  
According to one recent report , a mallard flying south caught sight of the domesticated white Peking ducks on the pond of a duck farm in Kenting . Its biological cycle was suddenly thrown out of kilter , and it settled down there and stayed into spring , unwilling to leave .  
While migratory birds do follow set paths on their journeys between north and south every year , they want to end up in safe and suitable locations . Every year climatic differences and other factors will vary the " final destinations " north and south , but Huiyan Peak was not named without reason .  
Also , from the Eastern Han ( 25-220 ) onward , the political center gradually moved from north China to south of the Yangtze . This geographical shift brought with it a gradual change in spatial attitudes . The limestone geology of southern China has endowed it with many deep and mysterious caves which nature has fashioned into remarkable shapes , and these constantly fired human imaginations .  
Taiwan 's " plum rains " were particularly heavy this year . The storms brought by the stationary front that creates the plum rains in June quickly raised water levels in the island 's reservoirs to dangerous levels . In the center and south of the island , from the mountains to the coastal plains , there were almost daily reports of flooding and landslides .  
For instance , the subsided coast of northern Taiwan is studded with beautiful eroded bays and promontories ; the sandy and muddy coast of the western alluvial plain is rich in human culture and is a paradise for migratory birds , a place where they can rest and feed as they pass through on their southward and northward journeys ; the coral reefs of the south coast are a rare natural treasure ; and the eroded escarpments of Taiwan 's east coast bear witness to the tectonic movements which have shaped our island over millions of years .  
There is no parallel in human history for the bronze-making culture that flourished in China over 3,000 years ago . Particularly noteworthy are the bronzes that have been unearthed at Anyang in the Yellow River basin . The style and manufacturing techniques of Shang bronzes spread far and wide-to modern-day Shan-dong in the east , Shanxi and Shaanxi in the west , Liaoning in the north , and Guangdong in the south .  
The Shandong students were already accustomed to gripping tight to their textbooks as they fled the chaos of war . Seeing the Nationalist-Communist situation taking a turn for the worse , to evade communist rule they followed the Nationalist government all the way south , under the leadership of loyal and patriotic school principals .  
For example , people in the belt south of the Yangtze River generally eat " Ningpo pudding , " made from sticky rice shaped into broad bars , while those hailing from Guangdong and the Southern Fujian region go for luobo pudding , made from a mixture of shredded white turnip ( luobo ) and long-grain rice . As Lin writes : " Although my family moved around a lot when I was little , Mother was quite stubborn about personally taking charge in the kitchen every New Year to make luobo pudding for the whole family .  
Last year the Buddha 's Light International Association organized New Year 's Eve dinners in the north , center and south of Taiwan , which were attended by more than 5,000 old folk who live alone . This year they are repeating the exercise , and are including a special event in Nantou County to bring some warmth and love to elderly survivors of the 9 / 21 earthquake there .  
Stained glass windows were a prominent feature of northern Europe 's gothic churches , while the walls and domes of the Byzantine churches of the south of the continent were decorated with biblical tales rendered in mosaics of multicolored glass tiles . It was as if glass , this brilliant , lustrous substance , could actually bring people closer to heaven .  
Chen Ding-nan , the new minister of justice , plans to establish an " independent commission against corruption " and a " black gold activities investigation center , " with offices in the north , center , and south of Taiwan . Plans are also afoot to produce legislation that will prevent " black gold " activities from taking on a legal veneer that protect them from punishment .  
Whether in the east , west , north or south , whether on Taiwan proper or on offshore islands , all will enjoy balanced , pluralistic development , and the gap between urban and rural areas will be reduced .  
A restaurateur who had already had Peter Sung design three restaurants for him , recently opened a large new Chinese restaurant on the seafront at Nice in the south of France . The premises-formerly a supermarket and large car park-were transformed by Sung into a bustling Chinese garden , with cascades splashing over rocks , and shoals of goldfish swimming in a pool crossed by a zig-zag stone bridge leading to a Chinese pavilion where one can lean out over the railing to enjoy the view .  
" The two easiest places to make a living in Taiwan back then were Chiufen in the north ( with its gold mine in Chinkuashih ) and Chishan in the south , " says Ku , who recalls that a kilo of bananas sold for NT $ 6 . One only needed to cut down a single bunch of bananas weighing 30 kilos to take in NT $ 180 , the equivalent of an entire week 's pay back then for the average working woman .  
With the rise of industry in Kaohsiung , the agricultural counties of central and southern Taiwan began to lag behind , but at least there was a minimal kind of balance on the island as a whole with " two heads , one north and one south . " And to some degree the provincial government 's location in Nantou-and the resulting stream of visiting city and county bureaucrats-meant that central Taiwan was n't all that forlorn .  
The latter was the northernmost of these three counties , and extended all the way to Taipei and Keelung , but settlers long declined to venture north of Touliu ( today the county seat of Yunlin ) . Further south in Tainan , the Dutch arrived in the 1620s and established a fortress called Zeelandia . Later in that century , the Ming loyalist Koxinga 's able minister Chen Yonghua adopted a policy of keeping Taiwan equally strong in both the cultural and military spheres . A period of cultural flowering ensued in the south .  
He had originally intended to locate his capital in Jiaozaitu ( part of present-day Taichung City ) because of its convenient location halfway between north and south on Taiwan 's western plain .  
However , explains Huang Wu-ta , director of the Taiwan Institute of Urban History , the conditions did not yet exist that would have allowed Jiaozaitu to serve as the capital . The overland transportation network during the late Qing dynasty was extremely poor , and people traveled north-south in Taiwan mainly via the sea . This factor marginalized Jiaozaitu , which had no port . Central Taiwan 's key population center was farther south in the coastal city of Lukang .  
While workers were building the Keelung-Taipei section of the rail line they struck gold between Chitu and Patu and set off a frantic gold rush . People poured into northern Taiwan , which rose to a position of undisputed pre-eminence vis-a-vis the south . Although the island has switched from Chinese sovereignty to Japanese and back again since that time , Taipei 's position as the political capital has never since been challenged .  
Pinglin is located on the Taipei-Ilan Highway , 38 km east of Taipei , and 42 km west of Ilan . The area , covering 171 square kilometres , is mostly mountainous , with the Fushih Mountains to the north , the Ayu Mountains to the south , and the Peishih River meandering through it . Most of the population of more than 6000 is concentrated here in the river 's small floodplain .  
Composed of doctors and medical students from Yangming University , this group campaigns across Taiwan , north and south , against their declared enemy : chronic illnesses in remote or poor locations that lack the resources to cope . For the last two decades , this battalion of doctors has criss-crossed Taiwan 's 21 counties and cities , and even served in Kinmen . Having started out with a simple mission to conduct pap smears , they now target chronic illnesses and do preventive community medicine , leaving ineradicable traces of their passing .  
Before the advent of acoustic imaging , the degree of understanding of the sun 's internal structure that could be gained from its surface oscillations was very limited . For instance , scientists were already aware that the cycle of sunspot activity is related to the way the north and south magnetic poles of the sun are reversed every 11 years . But where was the sun 's magnetic field located ?  
Seshui lies on the southwest side of Provincial Highway 21 , close to Tayen Tunnel , with Puli to the north and the famous scenic spot Sun Moon Lake to the south . The neighborhood has an area of something over 60 hectares , and 230-plus inhabitants , who live by farming . Their main crops are vegetables such as aubergines and beans , and high-value cash crops such as betel nuts , orchids and Assam tea .  
Hsu Yang-ming , deputy secretary-general of the DPP , says that traditional local powers-that-be-groups built around organized crime , collusion between officials and businessmen , and local factions-are now more like powers-that-were . Across the entire country from north to south , these local political forces , which have always had a pivotal role in legislative elections , are being weakened , and they appear much less capable of mobilizing voters in the traditional manner .  
Commenting on this phenomenon , mainland Chinese cultural critic Xie Xizhang notes that the residential patterns of old Bei-jing were disrupted by the Cultural Revolution . High-ranking government officials used to live primarily on the east side , and the area had a very cultured air . Rich merchants congregated on the west side , while the south side was the plebian part of town .  
Early flowering seasons in Yang - mingshan , mullet failing to swim south after the winter solstice , dengue fever crossing the Tropic of Cancer , unusual butterfly migrations , coral bleaching . . . . Global warming is blamed for rising sea levels , freak weather and frequent floods , but is it also responsible for some of the unusual phenomena in Taiwan 's natural world in recent years ?  
Vice President Lu stressed that this initiative was undertaken in support of President Chen 's " go south " policy , aimed at opening up new horizons for Taiwanese business investment in Southeast Asia . Further , she expressed her gratitude to Indonesia 's ruling and opposition parties and to members of its private sector for extending their hand of friendship and courageously embracing Taiwan 's expressions of goodwill in defiance of a powerful country 's bullying bluster .  
During Qing times , train station warehouses were strategic military entrepots ; during the Japanese occupation they were used as storage facilities by the sugar , salt , and forestry industries ; and after the war they were used to accommodate rail passengers on their way south or north . Although they were located in urban centers with good communication links , these warehouses stopped being used for freight storage many years ago .  
The ancestors of this pint-sized member of the family Sylviidae ( the old-world warblers ) came from cold northern lands . Biogeographical evidence shows that they first spread out northeastward from the Himalayas into northern and northeastern China and Japan , and later moved south during the ice ages , reaching Taiwan via southern China or Japan .  
In the mid-1990 ' s , Taiwan 's IT industry began to take off , and every major company was fighting for the ever-decreasing , prime property at Hsinchu , making it nigh-on impossible to secure a spot there . Then , in July 1996 , after considering the levels of industrial development in the north and the south of Taiwan , the government began formulating a plan for a " Southern Taiwan Science Park " .  
There 's an interesting story connected with the Taiwan Shinto Shrine . It was built from imported stone and cypress logged on Mt . Ali in central Taiwan . When colonial rule came to an end following Japan 's defeat in World War II , new rulers came in from China and the shrine was slated for dismantling . For the mere cost of the transport , painter Li Mei-shu had the priceless building materials carted off to Sanhsia south of Taipei , where he used them to renovate the Tsu Shih Temple .  
Buildings were built out over the sidewalks , buttressed by square beams or curved arches , with businesses downstairs and residences upstairs . This is the most characteristic architectural form shared by all of Taiwan 's cities and towns , north and south .  
Li sets her stories in her hometown of Lukang , here appearing as the city of Lu , about which vengeful female spirits have entrenched themselves , one each to the north , south , east , and west , and another in its center . Their implacability has put them outside of the cycle of life and death-unable to be reborn , they tarry in the human world as ghosts . Over the course of time , these ghosts have participated in and even helped to forge the island 's history .  
Helanshan Mountain , extending more than 250 kilometers to the north and south , is situated in the border area of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia , two large autonomous regions .  It is an important natural and geographical border , a water resource conservation forest and a natural ecological defense for the attacks of Tenggeli desert and Siberia cold wave .  
Mt . Helan , stretching 250 kilometers from south to north and located between Ningxia and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions , is the most important geographic line and water conservation forest region in China 's western areas .  It is also a natural ecological fence to prevent the eastward encroachment of Tengger Desert and the cold waves from Siberia .  
The Helan Mountain Range , about 250 kilometers long , extends from south to north along the common border of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia . It is an important natural geographical demarcation line in northwestern China as well as a water conservatory forest area .  The mountain range is also a natural protective shield , which stops the Tenger desert from expanding to the east and the inroad of Siberian cold current .  
Mt . Helan , stretching more than 250 km from south to north , is situated on the juncture of Ningxia and the Inner Mongolia , the two large autonomous regions .  An important natural geographical boundary as well as home of water-source nourished forests in western China , it also serves as a natural shield against the eastern invasion of Tengeli Desert and the onset of the Siberian cold current .  
according to the resolution , the biggest obstacles to the realization of the right to development lie at " the international macro economic level as reflected in the widening gap between the north and the south , the rich and the poor "  
At a time when the north and the south have signed a joint declaration of mutual non aggression and when the nuclear framework agreement between the DPRK and the U S has entered the stage of implementation , conditions are now ripe for Washington and Pyongyang to strike a new peace deal , which is also imperative , the paper said  
li also briefed the russian guests on china 's foreign policies he said that after the cold war , the world is facing a multi polarization trend yet the world is not peaceful new conflicts and contradictions keep occurring the gap between the north and the south is further enlarged , li said  
Our nation remains closely knit together by kinship as a homogeneous people , a unique entity in the world , and the whole nation , whether in the north , in the south , or abroad , is united by the common desire for national reunification .  
This brutal aggression extended to all parts of Iraq , from the far north to the extreme south and from the remote west to the eastern boundaries .  
Cutting down trees for firewood is also a major cause of deforestation in tropical dry forests and nonforest wooded areas located near dense human settlements in Africa and south Asia .  
A centrally administered railway system , covering some 150,000 kilometres of track , linked all the various parts of the vast Union territory stretching east to west over almost half the globe and north to south over half the northern hemisphere .  
These provoked a massive stampede of refugees across the border into Zaire in the northwest , overwhelming humanitarian agencies and nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) whose preparations had anticipated the simultaneous movement of refugees further south .  
Under the new Constitution , specific forms of administrative organization could be granted to some human settlements in the east and south of the country under precise juridical provisions adopted through constitutional laws .  
It was observed that ITU at its Radio Communication Assembly in 1993 had adopted a recommendation ( A / AC . 105 / C . 1 / CRP . 4 ) containing a definition of the geostationary orbit as a torus of thickness 600 kilometres around a mean Earth radius of 42,164 kilometres , extending to 15 degrees north and south latitudes , and that a satellite under such a definition could not be considered to be at a fixed position with regard to a point on the surface of the Earth .  
The pan-national unified State to be established in accordance with the proposal for reunification through confederation will form a confederated government in which the two regional autonomous governments of the north and south of Korea participate on an equal footing , and will be an independent , peaceful , non-aligned and neutral State that does not depend on any other big Power .  
However , he placed the main emphasis , as in his earlier reports , on the fact that government agents and members of various factions of the parties to the conflict in the south were continuing to commit many serious human rights violations - extrajudicial executions , systematic tortures , arbitrary arrests of individuals suspected of being political opponents , etc . - which affected all categories and strata of the population . 
On 4 March 1995 , at 1000 hours , a khaki-coloured Iraqi bus , carrying 45 military forces wearing khaki , was observed travelling from west to east , at a distance of 2 kilometres from the geographic coordinates of PB 152-478 on the map of south of Mehran , in no man 's land , between east of border pillar 27 / 7B and west of border pillar 27 / 8 .  
The agreement put forward by Israel , that the so-called South Lebanese Army ( SLA ) militia is responsible for the detention camp of Al-Khyam is totally refuted and unacceptable and does not exonerate it from responsibility since Israel is the occupying Power in south Lebanon and is , in the final analysis , responsible in international law for acts committed on the territories it occupies and the SLA militia is but a tool of the Israeli occupying force and would not exist without its support . 
However , the United States Administration , together with the south Korean puppet army , has , since 1976 , staged " team spirit " joint military exercises against us each year , mobilizing nuclear weapons instead of coming to the talks , and even cancelled the already proclaimed reduction plan of American troops in south Korea , in July 1979 .  
The actual size of the two buildings and the link is evident from the south , where sweeping reinforced concrete piers buttress the buildings set diagonally into the steeply sloping hillside .  
El Ni �� is a warm inshore current annually flowing south along the coast of Ecuador around the end of December and extending about every 7 to 10 years down the coast of Peru ; it can bring devastating weather to several global regions , including heavy rains and flooding as well as colder than normal winters across the United States , and severe droughts and dust storms in Australia .  
pointed out that the resolution mentioned above had been adopted on an initiative of the Sudan , motivated by its concern for the situation of more than 20,000 children who had been sequestered by the insurgent movement in the south of the country , which used them as explosives carriers , human shields in minefields and as a military reserve , a situation which was intolerable since it violated religious and humane principles .  
First , the current of the East Sea would have steered a drifting vessel in a northerly direction , while the North Korean submarine moved southwards , against the current , nearly 60 miles south of the demilitarized zone before running aground at our coast near Kangnung .  
I am concerned about the imprudent behaviour of the south Korean representative , as it will lead to intensified confrontation between the north and the south of Korea and have a negative effect on international peace and security as a whole .  
As to paragraph 6 , in which Iraq was accused of impeding the equitable distribution of foodstuffs among the regions , it was completely divorced from reality as clearly reflected in independent international reports ; the latter were eloquent in their praises of the system whereby provisions were delivered to the north , as well as to the centre and the south , without any discrimination . 
The United States is becoming more undisguised in its moves to build up a " tripartite military alliance " with Japan and south Korea , and moves forward on a full scale with the reintroduction of its cold war era policy to the Korean peninsula and its vicinity , by repeatedly launching joint military exercises among the United States , south Korea and Japan over the so-called " north Korea 's threat " .  
Now that north and south Korea have already signed an agreement on non-aggression and inaugurated the north-south joint military body , this detailed proposal of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , if realized , would bring about an epoch-making environment for d \ x { 5f4b } ente and peace on the Korean peninsula and would also create the prerequisite for a confederal reunification of Korea .  
It is the invalidation by the United States side of the key provisions of the Armistice Agreement that has paved the way for south Korea 's current status as the greatest United States overseas military base and nuclear base .  
To appeal to international organizations and their member States to bring pressure to bear on Israel to pay compensation to Lebanon for the damage caused by its repeated attacks on Lebanese territory and to take action to halt the inhumane and oppressive Israeli practices against the peaceful inhabitants of occupied Lebanese territory in the south and the western Bekaa ;  
In the meantime , Mr . Cassoulides , the official spokesman of the Greek Cypriot administration , has confirmed that in the context of the so-called " joint defence doctrine " the construction in south Cyprus of an air force base for Greece is effectively under way , and that the existing Paphos airport has already been closed to civilian air traffic for this purpose .  
I should like to inform you that United States warplanes operating from bases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are continuing to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq and are engaging in acts of reconnaissance , breaking the sound barrier and dropping heat flares over public and private property in the north and south of Iraq , causing damage and spreading alarm among the civilian population .  
Despite the satisfactory economic performance and the progress and acceleration of reconstruction , Israel 's continuous occupation of south Lebanon and its continued aggression against Lebanon and its citizens remain the major obstacle to comprehensive national recovery . 
Instead of descending by the east coast of Florida , they crossed the Florida peninsula to Key West and from there moved south , then west all of this within the region under United States air traffic control and then follow a straight line to the capital of Cuba .  
More recently , the humanitarian situation has seriously deteriorated as a result of renewed intense fighting in the north-western provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke , the outbreak of fighting in the south , increased massacres of civilians by both rebels and the Armed Forces , and the initially forceful repatriation by local Burundian authorities of large numbers of Rwandan refugees in the north-east .  
In October 1995 , fighting increased in intensity between rival factions in the city , causing the country 's main port in south Mogadishu to cease functioning and to have a negative effect on the flow of humanitarian assistance to the city and to the interior regions of the country .  
Community-based animal health workers continued to vaccinate cattle against rinderpest - a major cattle-killing disease - and treat other major livestock diseases of the south : contagious bovine pleuro-pneumonia , trypanosomiasis , liver fluke , anthrax and haemorrhagic septicaemia .  
For our part , we declared on 3 September 1996 that the illusory lines to the north of the 36th parallel and to the south of the 32nd parallel are considered null and void , and Iraq will act on this basis .  
Over half a century of occupation of south Korea by United States military forces has created the tragedy of a divided nation , put grave obstacles in the way of peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula , even in the current post-cold war era , and inflicted immeasurable misery and suffering on the entire Korean population .  
In fact , his real reasons for presenting such a report are political , and completely unrelated to human rights issues ; rather , they are connected with the conspiracy to divide Iraq by imposing the no-fly zones in the north and the south of the country .  
In this paragraph , Van der Stoel betrays his intentions and his established bad faith : how otherwise can these claims that there are no special circumstances in Iraq be interpreted , when he knows perfectly well that Iraq has been facing a hostile situation and experiencing unrest , quite apart from having to endure gross violations of its sovereignty and territorial integrity due to the imposition by certain of the allied States of the no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq , and direct military intervention ?  
The emergency joint meeting adopted a decision on taking strong countermeasures in response to the dangerous manoeuvre of the Kim Yong Sam cliques who are misusing the recently occurred accident during a training mission , aggravating the north-south confrontation and driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war in succession to the brutal crackdown on the peaceful unification events organized by the students of " Han Chong Ryon " of south Korea on 15 August 1996 by unreasonably relating those to us . 
When the south Korean puppets brutally cracked down on the patriotic pro-reunification events of the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils and students around 15 August with the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of combat police and injured and imprisoned thousands of them in an anti-communist fascist frenzy against the north , we controlled ourselves and hoped they would act with reason .  
Respect for the right of the Iraqi population to food and adequate health care was also called into question by the rationing system set up by the Government , which protected the elite of the Baath Party and the Iraqi military , but served as a way of subjugating the population to discourage any opposition and retaliating against the population in the south of the country , which was suspected of being hostile to the Iraqi regime .  
The question of displaced persons has been fundamentally settled between the two sides through the agreement on the exchange of populations reached between the two sides at the third round of the intercommunal talks held at Vienna from 31 July and 2 August 1975 , whereby the two sides agreed on a voluntary regrouping of populations , each in its own respective territory , the Turkish Cypriots in the north and the Greek Cypriots in the south ( see S / 11789 of 5 August 1975 ) . 
This form of action has been of special importance in view of the precarious social and economic situation , which has been compounded by the impact on the country of mandatory sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the unilateral economic blockade from the south . 
I am sure it is obvious to all persons living in the south that the economic , social and political isolation imposed upon us has been counter-productive as this treatment has helped us to get stronger on our feet and to find adequate alternatives for self-existence , all of which help to consolidate and give permanence to the division of the island .  
This millennial tension has left its mark to the north , south , east and west of this middle sea still beleaguered by numerous political , economic , social , humanitarian and environmental problems .  
The continuing rearmament programme in south Cyprus , construction of an air base in Paphos and the planned purchase of medium and long-range missiles are clearly offensive steps , rather than defensive as alleged by the Greek Cypriot side , and constitute a serious provocation towards the Turkish Cypriot side and Turkey .  
The inhuman social , economic and racial discrimination suffered by Turkish Cypriots in the south has also recently been highlighted by the Greek Cypriot press Alithia , in its 30 December 1996 edition , also reported on the dire living conditions of the Turkish Cypriot community of Limassol .

Reflecting the requirements of the situation prevailing at the time , the respected leader Comrade Kim Il Sung , in his speech on 6 August 1971 , advanced the policy of new , wide-ranging negotiations whereby we were ready to come into contact at any time with all political parties including the ruling " Democratic Republican Party " , social organizations and individual personages of south Korea . 
The DCRK is a unified State of a confederal form in which a unified national Government is established on condition that the north and the south recognize and tolerate each other 's ideas and systems , a Government in which the two sides are represented on an equal footing and under which they exercise regional autonomy respectively with equal power of authority and duties . 
The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung elucidated in an all-round way the questions on the founding of the DCRK , including the problem of forming a supreme national confederal assembly with an equal number of representatives from the north and the south and an appropriate number of representatives of overseas nationals under which a confederal standing committee is organized to discuss and decide on common issues related to the overall interests of the country and nation . 
Upon the initiative of the respected leader , a proposal was made in August 1981 to hold a Conference for the Promotion of National Reunification , with the participation of the representatives of the political parties and organizations from the north , the south and the overseas compatriots and to convene a joint conference in February 1982 to be attended by 100 persons , including politicians from the north , the south and overseas .  
Even under the situation where the United States and the south Korean authorities defiantly opposed the DPRK 's proposal for tripartite talks , the great leader took the positive step of mobilizing 150,000 Korean People 's armymen for peaceful construction in 1986 to defuse the tension on the Korean peninsula and advanced a proposal on 23 July 1987 for a massive phased reduction of the armed forces and declared a unilateral reduction of 100,000 of the People 's Army forces as a subsequent practical measure .  
At the beginning of the 1990s , the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung took the landmark initiative of demolishing the concrete walls built up on the south side of the military demarcation line , allowing free travel between the north and the south , and holding north-south high-level talks and the north-south summit talks to remove the root cause of the war and accelerate the process of peaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula in the next few years .  
The extensive fighting in the north and south of the country has displaced a significant proportion of the population and made it difficult for humanitarian aid agencies to conduct a consistent and effective relief programme .  
As already reported , the recent incident is , in essence , a part of the current reckless provocation moves of the south Korean chief executive to look for a way out of a most serious ruling crisis in a shocking incident and to delay his doomed life .  
Such a dramatic development as the current incident could be avoidable if the United States would not leave the maintenance of the demilitarized zone entirely to the south Korean puppets , insisting only on new war provocation , while neglecting our proposal for establishing an interim agreement that can replace the obsolete Korean Armistice Agreement , and for Democratic People 's Republic of Korea / United States military general-level talks . 
While crying for the introduction of diversified military equipment , the south Korean authorities are now shipping modern tanks , armoured vehicles , anti-aircraft missiles , anti-tank missiles and helicopters from the Russian Federation as well as the United States , Harpy unmanned attack planes from Israel and huge military equipment from many countries around the world .  
The gap in socio-economic development between the countries of the south and north of the region is widening , there remains in the area a critical mass of combustible material the Middle East conflict and the as yet unsettled Cyprus problem , and there is a high level of saturation with weapons , accompanied by the danger of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .  
At the recent XII Ministerial Conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , held at New Delhi , which concluded just a little over two weeks ago , the Non-Aligned Movement member countries had the privilege of hearing President Arafat in a special session of the ministerial conference , give a detailed presentation on the state of the peace process in the Middle East and the implications of the construction of the settlement by Israel at Jabal Abu Ghneim to the south of East Jerusalem .

Many developing countries , particularly in Africa south of the Sahara , continue to lack a sufficient level of national scientific capacity including a critical mass of well-trained scientists , technicians and engineers , which is required to generate scientific inventions and produce technological innovation , and to adapt and absorb technologies .  
Variances may occur to the actual physical distribution as a result of changes in cropping patterns , varying food demands , weather restrictions , location of weed , insect and disease infestations , future machinery malfunctions that were not foreseen , the number of contracts approved and / or blocked , plus seasonal machinery activities ( e.g . the majority of harvesters move to the south for the early harvest and migrate north as the crops ripen and become ready for harvest ) .  
On 21 October 1996 , at 10.08 hours , crew members of scheduled flight CU-170 of Cubana de Aviaci \ x { 93ee } ( Cuban Airlines ) , on board a Fokker-27 aircraft , flying the Havana-Las Tunas route , upon crossing the Gir \ x { 93ee } air corridor in the western region of Cuba , noticed a single-engine airplane flying from north to south , at about 1,000 feet ( 300 metres ) above them , apparently spraying or sprinkling unknown substances - some seven times - in an intermittent manner .  
The argument put forward by Israel , that the so-called South Lebanese Army militia is responsible for the detention camp of Khiam , is totally refuted and unacceptable and does not exonerate it from responsibility , since Israel is the occupying power in south Lebanon and is , in the final analysis , responsible in international law for acts committed on the territories it occupies .  
This suffices to prove that the present authorities of south Korea have pursued a more vicious policy of confrontation and war against the northern half of Korea than preceding military fascist regimes .  
Furthermore , arms sales to south Cyprus also constitute a violation of the 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider " the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts " and are obliged to " avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region , or otherwise contribute to regional instability " .

A weak cold front arrived at the south China coastal areas on October 4 .  The weather in Hong Kong turned hazy at first and became cloudy with thundery showers in the afternoon .  Around 80 millimetres of rainfall were recorded over parts of the Lantau Island .  
Since ancient times , the Chinese population could broadly be divided into agricultural and nomadic sectors due to geographic and climatic diversities within the Chinese territories .  The agricultural land and pastoral areas were established south and north of the Great Wall respectively .  
With an active trough of low pressure lingering over the vicinity of the south China coast for about two thirds of the month , the weather of June was marked by persistent heavy rain and thunderstorms .  The monthly rainfall amounted to 1083.6 millimetres , about three times the normal figure .  
After braving 800 miles through the world 's worst seas for 17 days , they miraculously arrived on the uninhabited south coast of South Georgia . However , they had to cross over the glaciers and mountains to reach the rescue station on the other side .  In 1916 , Shackleton returned to rescue the men on Elephant Island . After isolated for nearly two years in the barren and frigid Antarctic , no single one member of the 28-man crew was lost .  
The Planning Scheme Area covering about 193 hectares is located in the southern tip of the Kowloon Peninsula . It is bounded by the Victoria Harbour to the south , southwest and southeast ; Jordan Road and Gascoigne Road to the north ; and Hung Hom Bay Reclamation to the east .  
Under the original plan , with the help of a deep oceanic outfall which would form part of the remaining stages of HATS , the treated sewage will be discharged in the deep fast-flowing water south of Hong Kong Island where it would be safely diluted and dispersed .  
Taiwan is surrounded by waters . The eastern coast of the island is rocky , with a sudden drop into the ocean . Its offshore waters form pathways for many species of migratory fish traveling both from the south and the north . The west coast has a gradual , inclined shelf .  
It is one of the largest cantilever bridges in the world . The construction method used " travel wagons " moving by segments from both sides of the existing piers to pour concrete with reinforcing steel . The process continued , segment by segment , the whole length of the span until the " wagons " met midway at the hinged connection point . The north and south approaches of the bridge are supported on prestressed concrete girders and cast-in-place concrete piles with spans from 30 to 40 meters .  
The 6-lane main bridge is prestressed concrete cantilever construction at the center , with a total length of 671 meters . The maximum width is 34.6 meters . The north and south approaches are 158.8 meters and 525.5 meters long , respectively . As conceived by its architect , the design of this bridge spanning the Keelung river avoided building piers in deep water , which would increase construction cost and obstruct the flood flow during typhoon periods .  
Costing about NT $ 7.3 billion ( US $ 203 million ) and taking six years to construct , the railway was fully opened to traffic on Feb . 1 , 1980 . Traversing the mountainous region along the northeast coast of Taiwan , from Nanshenghu in Ilan County in the north to Tienpu in Hualien County in the south , the railway is part of the planned round-the-island system . It will play a major role in boosting the economy and tourism on the under-developed east coast of Taiwan as well as strengthening national defense .  
After passing through such scenic spots as Hua Yuan Hsin Cheng ( flower garden city ) , Yen Tzu Hu ( swallow lake ) , Chung Chih Kung Yuan ( loyal administration park ) , and Hong Ho Ku ( red river valley ) , the road running south from Taipei along the Hsintien Chi ( stream ) reaches Wulai , an aboriginal village located close to the southern extremity of Taipei County .  
Covering an area of 163 kilometers on the western coastal plain , Taichung 's location has aided economic development of the city . Taichung 's harbor and verdant outlying fields provide fresh fish and produce for busy city markets , and both the city and surrounding area are served by an efficient network of roads and railways , linking Taichung to centers in the north and south of Taiwan .  
Its fruit , however , has earned a place in the hearts and appetites of Chinese everywhere for its many gastronomic and medicinal uses . On Taiwan , the plant thrives best from the region south of Chiayi , in central Taiwan . Originally grown for personal consumption , farmers grew the hardy ling chiao in fishponds .  
To tourists , Keelung is most famous for its scenic spots , and seasonal activities . Being both mountainous and adjacent to the sea , Keelung 's scenery is particularly lovely . Its craggy coastline is filled with unusual rock formations such as the " Beancurd Rock " at Hop'ingtao Park . Further south one finds lush green hills dotted with brilliantly colored temples , the most famous of which include the Ling Ch'uan temple on Yueh Mei Mountain , and the Tsu Yun and Ta Chueh Temples in the Anlo district .  
Located in the southern portion of Nant'ou County , Chushan is bordered on the east by Luku Township and to the south by Yunlin County 's Kuk'eng . The natural topography of the area has helped to shape Chushan 's unique character . The rugged , majestic peaks of the Central Mountain Range bisect the area and two sparkling rivers , the Ch'ing Shui Hsi and the Cho Shui Hsi meander through its borders .  
The geographic position of the island off the east coast of the Asian landmass places it in one of the main migratory flyways for countless bird species making their annual winter trips south from the cold lands of north Asia .  
Included among these are numerous water fowl varieties such as wild geese , ducks and gulls . Originating from their summer nesting grounds in Japan , Manchuria , Siberia and the plateau region of Mongolia , they fly southward making Taiwan one of their chief wintering and resting stops . Those that take brief respite here continue on to destinations further to the south like the Philippines , Indonesia and sometimes fly as far south as the southern hemispheric lands of Australia and New Zealand .  
All came to be divided into three types , based on the geographical areas of north , middle and south . Beginning in 1975 , the Ministry of Education began the work of unifying sign languages on Taiwan .  
According to a Ching dynasty gazetteer , " Taiwan is surrounded on four sides by sea ; tall mountains extend from the north to the south . To the west our people live mixed with the indigenous people ; to the east live only the indigenous people . "  
People from points south flocked there to do business , making it second only to P'ingtung itself as a commercial center . The town became the central market for farmers to sell their red beans , betel nuts , coconuts , and other local specialities , from where they were sold wholesale to other markets .  
Hainan , like southern Taiwan and southern Yunnan , has tropical seasonal winds , year-round summer , and abundant rainfall , making it possible to achieve three or four harvests a year . And the south of the island is suited for growing coffee , rubber trees , and other tropical crops .  
One hundred years ago , Taipei was surrounded by a sturdy protective wall . The wall , completed in three years , was square , and had four gates , one in the north , south , east , and west . There was also another small gate on the southern side .  
Springtime in the south of China has but a few days of warm sunlight and gentle breezes ; soon the weather turns cloudy or cold , burying that rare and precious fragrance .  
Malawi is located in southeast Africa , bordering on Zambia to the west , Tanzania to the northeast and Mozambique to the east and south . It has an area of 118,500 square kilometers , one fifth of which is covered by lakes .  
Kenting , situated in the south of Taiwan , has a tropical climate , with ferocious mosquitoes , poisonous snakes and a fierce summer sun . Liu always went off to wait for them before dawn , before the monkeys had set out from home to romp and forage for food , returning only at dusk . He often waited in the forest for eight or nine hours and only sighted the monkeys at sunrise .  
Mahjongg 's compulsive hold over its aficionados can be seen from the following true stories : A typhoon had forced Liu Hsiao-chen to cut short her trip down south , and worriedly she made her way back to Taipei . As she neared home through knee-deep flood water and in the pitch dark of a power blackout her anxiety grew . But stepping in at the door , there were her parents and a couple of neighbors happily engrossed in a game of mahjongg , playing by candlelight and with their feet perched up on stools .  
When the government moved to Taiwan , with people from the various provinces following close behind , the multifarious flavors of north and south China hit the ground running in Taiwan . Add to this the local native style , and you could say that this is the most fortuitous event in the history of Chinese food since somebody figured out how to make fire from rubbing sticks together in ancient times .  
Going south along Hsin Sheng South Road past Hsin Yi Road , you pass the Chin Hua Girls ' Senior High and Taipei Mosque on the right , and on the left stretches the zone designated for the No . 7 municipal park . Here stands a row of car repair garages which , once they close down after dark , turn into a deserted oasis of darkness long familiar to Taipei residents .  
Except for the spring and fall ancestral sacrifices and grave sweeping on the Ch'ing-ming festival , few people go there . Just one elderly Japanese quietly accompanies these homesick spirits in the cold winter months longing for a wind from their native land to the south . The Chinese have a saying that " a fallen leaf wants to return to its roots . "  
Thinking about all this from the angle of historical geography , I think northerners are used to being ruled by nomadic tribes , and the physical environment makes northerners more open-minded ; southerners , on the other hand , are the stubborn guardians of Chinese cultural traditions , so to speak , they opened up the south when they fled there to escape foreign domination , so they have a strong " spirit of resistance . " Q : Of what benefit were your two years of fieldwork ?  
My fieldwork was carried out before the communist occupation of the mainland , when the streets and historic buildings were in good shape and Chinese culture was well maintained . I travelled south of the Yangtze by boat , rode on horseback , and travelled by wooden handcart on the loess plain , genuinely experiencing the original China at first hand .  
In a commercialized society , with temple meetings in south Taiwan increasingly large , yi-chen are still not without a way out to survive . But with the gradual outmigration of the rural population , the trend of waxing and waning among community and professional chen can not , it seems , be altered .  
Chuo : In fact , when Lan Ling had just been established , we had no real concept of commercial drama . In order to appeal to a broader base , our ticket prices were very low . In Taipei , sales were OK , but this was impractical in the center and south of Taiwan . Sometimes sales would only be one-third or one-fifth of Taipei .  
Submarines lose some of their superiority in the relatively shallow Taiwan Straits , where sea trenches are not wide enough for use , and military experts believe there can be at the most only thirteen mainland submarines deployed around Taiwan , to the north , east , south and southwest where the waters are deeper .  
These products of cultural fushion from 200 or 300 years ago are scattered all across Europe . Just open the map - - from Sicily in the south to Fagervik in the north , from St . Petersburg in the east to Lisbon in the west - - well-preserved specimens of chinoiserie can be found everywhere . This month 's photo essay presents some of the pictures of chinoiserie Sinorama has garnered from across the continent of Europe .  
Taichung will continue to be the center of central Taiwan 's urban zone . " Liu Yu-shan believes central Taiwan is already developing into an urban zone centered on Taichung city and extending north to Fengyuan , south to Changhua and Wufeng and west to Chingshui , Shalu and Taichung Harbor , forming a commercial entity of 2.5 million people . People could not be brought into Taichung city center in the past because of road transport problems .  
Puli is right in the geographic center of Taiwan . Some people say that Taiwan 's contemporary food market is ' controlled by President in the north and by Wei chuan in the south . ' Although Taiwan Sugar is getting off the blocks relatively late , one day you may be hearing ' Taiwan Sugar controls the center , ' " says Hsieh with confidence , because " there are still so many treasures to be unearthed at our Puli ! "  
Chen Wu-hsiong , the head of the Council of Agriculture 's Planning Department , points out that peanuts and garlic are crops grown in coastal regions of the south . Dried lilies and mushrooms are traditional crops grown in mountainous regions of eastern and central Taiwan . These areas share the characteristic of being relatively poor and barren and not well suited for growing other crops . Furthermore , families have farmed the same land for generations .  
" This is because Taiwan was pioneered from south to north . At first the south was opened up , and with illness rampant in that pioneering period , expelling the evil and clearing away misfortune required strong methods . Thus the more martial and ferocious Master Taitzu and Wang Yeh flourished more , " argues Cheng Chih-ming .  
Researchers have endeavored to find the reasons why grey mullet production has been unstable in recent years . One important discovery is that although the cold water mass from the mainland heads south to Taiwan , if it is n't sustained , which is to say if it does n't come far enough south , then it wo n't be strong enough to get into that push-pull dynamic with the Kuroshio Current , so that the fish will not form into schools . "  
Measurements show that it was an irregularly shaped rectangle , about 430 meters wide east to west and 540 meters long north to south . The area of the city was about 200,000 square meters . Archaeologists have even discovered remnants of city walls built to a height of six or seven meters . This dirt wall is from 4000 years before our time .  
Situated in the southern part of Yunnan Province , Pu'er Township ( in ancient times known as Pu'er Prefecture ) from early in the Tang Dynasty onward , was Yunnan 's commercial tea center . The Tibetans , Mongolians and other ethnic minorities from the northwest , brought horses for barter . They traded horses for tea , forming the famous " tea-horse trade . " Other teas , sold in Thailand and Burma to the south or shipped to the northern capitals , all would pass through Pu'er .  
It grows on the Hengchun peninsula by the Central Mountain Range in the far south of the island , and also on Orchid Island ( Lanyu ) to the east of Taiwan . This pure powdery white flower which blooms in great numbers is sometimes called the Taiwan Amah because of the similarity in sound of its scientific name , Phalaenopsis Amabilis . Its leaves are oval and light green in tint . The long stem runs to 60 centimeters .  
Planning an Itinerary : Most major travel destinations are south of Shihtiping . For this reason , it is best to lay an emphasis on visiting the central and southern portions of the east coast , whether traveling by private vehicle or by public transport . Be sure to plan for a journey of at least three days and two nights .  
In recent years the many new galleries springing up in the south have stressed natural subject matter , and bright and intense colors , quite different from the cool style of northern Taiwan .  
Five years later the low wall around the city had been completed , and artillery placements were added to all four gates ( north , south , east , and west ) to ward off attacks from indigenous peoples or foreign military units . The internal and external walls were each twenty feet thick , and there was a moat around the outside . Such was China 's southernmost county seat .  
A magic time machineThe tale begins two hundred years ago with a great flood that visited the old Penkang River ( now known as the Peikang River ) . An ancient village situated along the river was completely inundated , and the inhabitants were forced to flee , some moving north , others moving south .  
There can be few among the travellers hurrying north or south along the section of the freeway between Tai-an and Sanyi who are not struck by the sudden appearance of this desolate , barren scenery where plain meets plateau , as they pass by the Taan River and Huoyan Mountains . As far as the eye can see , there is no sign of human activity , apart from the matchbox-like gravel trucks on the river embankments .  
" The ' huachung ' [ or central Chinese climate ] zone of mainland China and the ' huanan ' [ or southern Chinese climate ] zone divide just about at the Ta-an River . To the north , where the rains are heavy , the settlers built wooden structures offering strong protection against the rain . It 's drier to the south , so there they built cool and shady bamboo structures . " And the abundance of rocks strewn on the bed of the Ta-an River led to their use in the embankments between rice paddies .  
Professor B . J . Habibie , Indonesia 's State Minister for Research and Technology , has said publicly : " At some stage Singapore , with its limited natural and human resources but rapid economic growth , is certain to reach a critical pressure , just like a balloon ; and Batam , 20km south of Singapore , is ready to catch the balloon which will be squeezed out of Singapore 's balloon . "  
At this time the autumn farming activities went into a phase of decline , and in the north the weather turned cold . There was always some fear that barbarian tribes might " descend south to graze their horses . " At this time everyone began to brush up on their martial skills , even actively going out to kill the barbarians or steal the fat horses and goats that they raised !  
However , from the 17th century onwards , wave after wave of immigrants flooded onto this peaceful , happy land through the harbor at Tainan , encroaching on the Sirayas ' living space . Those Siraya who did not retreat further and further south or into the mountains accepted the rule of the incoming political authority and were subsequently assimilated .  
A 19th century English naturalist , exploring the clear waters and sharp cliffs , recorded the stunning impression these imposing precipices by the sea made on him : " The Portuguese must have first seen this island from the north or the south , for if they had seen it from the east , they would not have chosen a word as mundane as ' beautiful ' to describe it . "  
The common saying goes , " Mild in the south , salty in the north , sour in the east , and spicy in the west . " The food of Fujian , which lies in the south of China , is best known for its light , fresh flavor .  
Later , during the Wei and Chin dynasties , and during the period of the division of the country into north and south , the " nine official ranks system " was adopted , further consolidating the feudal system . It was said that " No poor families could attain high rank , and no wealthy families would be given low rank . "  
It is the dangers posed to juvenile deer by wild dogs that causes concern . Nevertheless , today with human footsteps covering every stretch of the land , it is impossible to let the deer go completely wild . Not wanting to put all their eggs in one basket , project personnel hope to select repopulation locales in northern , eastern and southern Taiwan . Since they have been operating in Kenting ( in the south ) for 12 years now , Yangming-shan National Park ( in the north ) is being considered as the second locale .  
He was said to have " strokes of iron and hooks of silver , " that is , a perfect modulation between the bold and the delicate . Wang Xizhi , of the Eastern Jin , which fled south from the encroachment of invaders , displayed a helpless yet defiant vital force through his calligraphy .  
The saying goes that " tangerines grown beyond the Huai River are small and dry . " Tangerines and oranges need the humid climate and fertile soils of the south to produce fragrant , sweet and juicy fruits . If they are transplanted north of the Huai River ( which flows West to East halfway between the Yangtze and the Yellow River ) , the soil and climate do n't suit them , and they only produce dry and undersized fruits .  
Spreading out the map of Taiwan , we see how the Tanshui River system spreads across northern Taiwan like a gigantic hand . Of its two major tributaries , the Pei-shih River in the north is cut off halfway by the high Feitsui Dam , while the Tahan River to the south is blocked by the Shih-men Dam . These structures have created two enormous artificial lakes , which supply one of life 's most basic necessities to a third of Taiwan 's population .  
In October last year it was reported that Taichung Station was to be moved underground , and that the old station building , which dates from the Japanese occupation era , might be demolished . The RCS joined with several other cultural and historical associations to put on a campaign to plead for the life of the 80-year-old station , including an event in which groups rode trains from both north and south to meet in Taichung . Finally they managed to get the station building designated a Grade 2 national monument by the Ministry of the Interior .  
Driving south along the freeway , you leave behind moist northern Taiwan and reach the Huoyan Mountains of Miaoli County . This dry , barren land presents a scene of nothing but landslip-scarred brown earth . But the cold windward upper slopes of the mountains are the lonely stronghold of the " minority people " among Taiwan 's pines-the masson pine ( Pinus massoniana ) .  
A woman who held a master 's degree married a husband who came from the rural south . On the first day of the marriage , in the kitchen of her motherinlaw 's rustic house , she faced a mountain of dirty dishes left behind by the visiting guests and relatives . She washed dishes until she cried .  
Guatemala is more than 108,800 square kilometers in area . The land is high in the south but low in the north . Guatemala City , located in the middle of the country , stands at an elevation of 1,500 meters above sea level . Its climate is cool , almost as if it were naturally air-conditioned .  
The poet Alexander Pope was an early enthusiast for the Chinese view of nature and , with the help of Burlington , built a small garden on the bank of the winding Thames river in the south London suburbs . It had no fence , parallel paths or symmetrical flower beds . He planned to make it a place where he could engage in literary and artistic pursuits .  
Kun Opera , which derives its name from the Kunshan area of Jiangsu Province , where it first came into popularity , has one style of tune . As early as the late Yuan and early Ming dynasties , it was recognized as one form of southern song . This period was one of intense political , economic and cultural development in the south .  
It began with the late-Yuan Emperor Shun , who favored the south and moved the empire 's political center there . By the Ming dynasty , the scenic southern banks of the Yangtze River were also home to booming trade and a flowering of the arts which saw frequent performances of music and dance .  
Oblivious to the traffic thundering across the Yungfu and Chungcheng bridges , which connect the south side of Taipei City with Taipei County , the ducks forage among the cattails and turn up algae , quite in keeping with their nature . There is none of the jostling and bickering of domestic ducks raised in pens . Against the distant roar of the traffic , the birds ' occasional calls from the sandbars lend a strange serenity to the scene , imparting a sense of harmony and grace rarely seen in this bustling metropolis .  
According to one recent report , a mallard flying south caught sight of the domesticated white Peking ducks on the pond of a duck farm in Kenting . Its biological cycle was suddenly thrown out of kilter , and it settled down there and stayed into spring , unwilling to leave .  
While migratory birds do follow set paths on their journeys between north and south every year , they want to end up in safe and suitable locations . Every year climatic differences and other factors will vary the " final destinations " north and south , but Huiyan Peak was not named without reason .  
Also , from the Eastern Han ( 25-220 ) onward , the political center gradually moved from north China to south of the Yangtze . This geographical shift brought with it a gradual change in spatial attitudes . The limestone geology of southern China has endowed it with many deep and mysterious caves which nature has fashioned into remarkable shapes , and these constantly fired human imaginations .  
Taiwan 's " plum rains " were particularly heavy this year . The storms brought by the stationary front that creates the plum rains in June quickly raised water levels in the island 's reservoirs to dangerous levels . In the center and south of the island , from the mountains to the coastal plains , there were almost daily reports of flooding and landslides .  
For instance , the subsided coast of northern Taiwan is studded with beautiful eroded bays and promontories ; the sandy and muddy coast of the western alluvial plain is rich in human culture and is a paradise for migratory birds , a place where they can rest and feed as they pass through on their southward and northward journeys ; the coral reefs of the south coast are a rare natural treasure ; and the eroded escarpments of Taiwan 's east coast bear witness to the tectonic movements which have shaped our island over millions of years .  
There is no parallel in human history for the bronze-making culture that flourished in China over 3,000 years ago . Particularly noteworthy are the bronzes that have been unearthed at Anyang in the Yellow River basin . The style and manufacturing techniques of Shang bronzes spread far and wide-to modern-day Shan-dong in the east , Shanxi and Shaanxi in the west , Liaoning in the north , and Guangdong in the south .  
The Shandong students were already accustomed to gripping tight to their textbooks as they fled the chaos of war . Seeing the Nationalist-Communist situation taking a turn for the worse , to evade communist rule they followed the Nationalist government all the way south , under the leadership of loyal and patriotic school principals .  
For example , people in the belt south of the Yangtze River generally eat " Ningpo pudding , " made from sticky rice shaped into broad bars , while those hailing from Guangdong and the Southern Fujian region go for luobo pudding , made from a mixture of shredded white turnip ( luobo ) and long-grain rice . As Lin writes : " Although my family moved around a lot when I was little , Mother was quite stubborn about personally taking charge in the kitchen every New Year to make luobo pudding for the whole family .  
Last year the Buddha 's Light International Association organized New Year 's Eve dinners in the north , center and south of Taiwan , which were attended by more than 5,000 old folk who live alone . This year they are repeating the exercise , and are including a special event in Nantou County to bring some warmth and love to elderly survivors of the 9 / 21 earthquake there .  
Stained glass windows were a prominent feature of northern Europe 's gothic churches , while the walls and domes of the Byzantine churches of the south of the continent were decorated with biblical tales rendered in mosaics of multicolored glass tiles . It was as if glass , this brilliant , lustrous substance , could actually bring people closer to heaven .  
Chen Ding-nan , the new minister of justice , plans to establish an " independent commission against corruption " and a " black gold activities investigation center , " with offices in the north , center , and south of Taiwan . Plans are also afoot to produce legislation that will prevent " black gold " activities from taking on a legal veneer that protect them from punishment .  
Whether in the east , west , north or south , whether on Taiwan proper or on offshore islands , all will enjoy balanced , pluralistic development , and the gap between urban and rural areas will be reduced .  
A restaurateur who had already had Peter Sung design three restaurants for him , recently opened a large new Chinese restaurant on the seafront at Nice in the south of France . The premises-formerly a supermarket and large car park-were transformed by Sung into a bustling Chinese garden , with cascades splashing over rocks , and shoals of goldfish swimming in a pool crossed by a zig-zag stone bridge leading to a Chinese pavilion where one can lean out over the railing to enjoy the view .  
" The two easiest places to make a living in Taiwan back then were Chiufen in the north ( with its gold mine in Chinkuashih ) and Chishan in the south , " says Ku , who recalls that a kilo of bananas sold for NT $ 6 . One only needed to cut down a single bunch of bananas weighing 30 kilos to take in NT $ 180 , the equivalent of an entire week 's pay back then for the average working woman .  
With the rise of industry in Kaohsiung , the agricultural counties of central and southern Taiwan began to lag behind , but at least there was a minimal kind of balance on the island as a whole with " two heads , one north and one south . " And to some degree the provincial government 's location in Nantou-and the resulting stream of visiting city and county bureaucrats-meant that central Taiwan was n't all that forlorn .  
The latter was the northernmost of these three counties , and extended all the way to Taipei and Keelung , but settlers long declined to venture north of Touliu ( today the county seat of Yunlin ) . Further south in Tainan , the Dutch arrived in the 1620s and established a fortress called Zeelandia . Later in that century , the Ming loyalist Koxinga 's able minister Chen Yonghua adopted a policy of keeping Taiwan equally strong in both the cultural and military spheres . A period of cultural flowering ensued in the south .  
He had originally intended to locate his capital in Jiaozaitu ( part of present-day Taichung City ) because of its convenient location halfway between north and south on Taiwan 's western plain .  
However , explains Huang Wu-ta , director of the Taiwan Institute of Urban History , the conditions did not yet exist that would have allowed Jiaozaitu to serve as the capital . The overland transportation network during the late Qing dynasty was extremely poor , and people traveled north-south in Taiwan mainly via the sea . This factor marginalized Jiaozaitu , which had no port . Central Taiwan 's key population center was farther south in the coastal city of Lukang .  
While workers were building the Keelung-Taipei section of the rail line they struck gold between Chitu and Patu and set off a frantic gold rush . People poured into northern Taiwan , which rose to a position of undisputed pre-eminence vis-a-vis the south . Although the island has switched from Chinese sovereignty to Japanese and back again since that time , Taipei 's position as the political capital has never since been challenged .  
Pinglin is located on the Taipei-Ilan Highway , 38 km east of Taipei , and 42 km west of Ilan . The area , covering 171 square kilometres , is mostly mountainous , with the Fushih Mountains to the north , the Ayu Mountains to the south , and the Peishih River meandering through it . Most of the population of more than 6000 is concentrated here in the river 's small floodplain .  
Composed of doctors and medical students from Yangming University , this group campaigns across Taiwan , north and south , against their declared enemy : chronic illnesses in remote or poor locations that lack the resources to cope . For the last two decades , this battalion of doctors has criss-crossed Taiwan 's 21 counties and cities , and even served in Kinmen . Having started out with a simple mission to conduct pap smears , they now target chronic illnesses and do preventive community medicine , leaving ineradicable traces of their passing .  
Before the advent of acoustic imaging , the degree of understanding of the sun 's internal structure that could be gained from its surface oscillations was very limited . For instance , scientists were already aware that the cycle of sunspot activity is related to the way the north and south magnetic poles of the sun are reversed every 11 years . But where was the sun 's magnetic field located ?  
Seshui lies on the southwest side of Provincial Highway 21 , close to Tayen Tunnel , with Puli to the north and the famous scenic spot Sun Moon Lake to the south . The neighborhood has an area of something over 60 hectares , and 230-plus inhabitants , who live by farming . Their main crops are vegetables such as aubergines and beans , and high-value cash crops such as betel nuts , orchids and Assam tea .  
Hsu Yang-ming , deputy secretary-general of the DPP , says that traditional local powers-that-be-groups built around organized crime , collusion between officials and businessmen , and local factions-are now more like powers-that-were . Across the entire country from north to south , these local political forces , which have always had a pivotal role in legislative elections , are being weakened , and they appear much less capable of mobilizing voters in the traditional manner .  
Commenting on this phenomenon , mainland Chinese cultural critic Xie Xizhang notes that the residential patterns of old Bei-jing were disrupted by the Cultural Revolution . High-ranking government officials used to live primarily on the east side , and the area had a very cultured air . Rich merchants congregated on the west side , while the south side was the plebian part of town .  
Early flowering seasons in Yang - mingshan , mullet failing to swim south after the winter solstice , dengue fever crossing the Tropic of Cancer , unusual butterfly migrations , coral bleaching . . . . Global warming is blamed for rising sea levels , freak weather and frequent floods , but is it also responsible for some of the unusual phenomena in Taiwan 's natural world in recent years ?  
Vice President Lu stressed that this initiative was undertaken in support of President Chen 's " go south " policy , aimed at opening up new horizons for Taiwanese business investment in Southeast Asia . Further , she expressed her gratitude to Indonesia 's ruling and opposition parties and to members of its private sector for extending their hand of friendship and courageously embracing Taiwan 's expressions of goodwill in defiance of a powerful country 's bullying bluster .  
During Qing times , train station warehouses were strategic military entrepots ; during the Japanese occupation they were used as storage facilities by the sugar , salt , and forestry industries ; and after the war they were used to accommodate rail passengers on their way south or north . Although they were located in urban centers with good communication links , these warehouses stopped being used for freight storage many years ago .  
The ancestors of this pint-sized member of the family Sylviidae ( the old-world warblers ) came from cold northern lands . Biogeographical evidence shows that they first spread out northeastward from the Himalayas into northern and northeastern China and Japan , and later moved south during the ice ages , reaching Taiwan via southern China or Japan .  
In the mid-1990 ' s , Taiwan 's IT industry began to take off , and every major company was fighting for the ever-decreasing , prime property at Hsinchu , making it nigh-on impossible to secure a spot there . Then , in July 1996 , after considering the levels of industrial development in the north and the south of Taiwan , the government began formulating a plan for a " Southern Taiwan Science Park " .  
There 's an interesting story connected with the Taiwan Shinto Shrine . It was built from imported stone and cypress logged on Mt . Ali in central Taiwan . When colonial rule came to an end following Japan 's defeat in World War II , new rulers came in from China and the shrine was slated for dismantling . For the mere cost of the transport , painter Li Mei-shu had the priceless building materials carted off to Sanhsia south of Taipei , where he used them to renovate the Tsu Shih Temple .  
Buildings were built out over the sidewalks , buttressed by square beams or curved arches , with businesses downstairs and residences upstairs . This is the most characteristic architectural form shared by all of Taiwan 's cities and towns , north and south .  
Li sets her stories in her hometown of Lukang , here appearing as the city of Lu , about which vengeful female spirits have entrenched themselves , one each to the north , south , east , and west , and another in its center . Their implacability has put them outside of the cycle of life and death-unable to be reborn , they tarry in the human world as ghosts . Over the course of time , these ghosts have participated in and even helped to forge the island 's history .  
Helanshan Mountain , extending more than 250 kilometers to the north and south , is situated in the border area of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia , two large autonomous regions .  It is an important natural and geographical border , a water resource conservation forest and a natural ecological defense for the attacks of Tenggeli desert and Siberia cold wave .  
Mt . Helan , stretching 250 kilometers from south to north and located between Ningxia and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Regions , is the most important geographic line and water conservation forest region in China 's western areas .  It is also a natural ecological fence to prevent the eastward encroachment of Tengger Desert and the cold waves from Siberia .  
The Helan Mountain Range , about 250 kilometers long , extends from south to north along the common border of Ningxia and Inner Mongolia . It is an important natural geographical demarcation line in northwestern China as well as a water conservatory forest area .  The mountain range is also a natural protective shield , which stops the Tenger desert from expanding to the east and the inroad of Siberian cold current .  
Mt . Helan , stretching more than 250 km from south to north , is situated on the juncture of Ningxia and the Inner Mongolia , the two large autonomous regions .  An important natural geographical boundary as well as home of water-source nourished forests in western China , it also serves as a natural shield against the eastern invasion of Tengeli Desert and the onset of the Siberian cold current .  
according to the resolution , the biggest obstacles to the realization of the right to development lie at " the international macro economic level as reflected in the widening gap between the north and the south , the rich and the poor "  
At a time when the north and the south have signed a joint declaration of mutual non aggression and when the nuclear framework agreement between the DPRK and the U S has entered the stage of implementation , conditions are now ripe for Washington and Pyongyang to strike a new peace deal , which is also imperative , the paper said  
li also briefed the russian guests on china 's foreign policies he said that after the cold war , the world is facing a multi polarization trend yet the world is not peaceful new conflicts and contradictions keep occurring the gap between the north and the south is further enlarged , li said  
Our nation remains closely knit together by kinship as a homogeneous people , a unique entity in the world , and the whole nation , whether in the north , in the south , or abroad , is united by the common desire for national reunification .  
This brutal aggression extended to all parts of Iraq , from the far north to the extreme south and from the remote west to the eastern boundaries .  
Cutting down trees for firewood is also a major cause of deforestation in tropical dry forests and nonforest wooded areas located near dense human settlements in Africa and south Asia .  
A centrally administered railway system , covering some 150,000 kilometres of track , linked all the various parts of the vast Union territory stretching east to west over almost half the globe and north to south over half the northern hemisphere .  
These provoked a massive stampede of refugees across the border into Zaire in the northwest , overwhelming humanitarian agencies and nongovernmental organizations ( NGOs ) whose preparations had anticipated the simultaneous movement of refugees further south .  
Under the new Constitution , specific forms of administrative organization could be granted to some human settlements in the east and south of the country under precise juridical provisions adopted through constitutional laws .  
It was observed that ITU at its Radio Communication Assembly in 1993 had adopted a recommendation ( A / AC . 105 / C . 1 / CRP . 4 ) containing a definition of the geostationary orbit as a torus of thickness 600 kilometres around a mean Earth radius of 42,164 kilometres , extending to 15 degrees north and south latitudes , and that a satellite under such a definition could not be considered to be at a fixed position with regard to a point on the surface of the Earth .  
The pan-national unified State to be established in accordance with the proposal for reunification through confederation will form a confederated government in which the two regional autonomous governments of the north and south of Korea participate on an equal footing , and will be an independent , peaceful , non-aligned and neutral State that does not depend on any other big Power .  
However , he placed the main emphasis , as in his earlier reports , on the fact that government agents and members of various factions of the parties to the conflict in the south were continuing to commit many serious human rights violations - extrajudicial executions , systematic tortures , arbitrary arrests of individuals suspected of being political opponents , etc . - which affected all categories and strata of the population . 
On 4 March 1995 , at 1000 hours , a khaki-coloured Iraqi bus , carrying 45 military forces wearing khaki , was observed travelling from west to east , at a distance of 2 kilometres from the geographic coordinates of PB 152-478 on the map of south of Mehran , in no man 's land , between east of border pillar 27 / 7B and west of border pillar 27 / 8 .  
The agreement put forward by Israel , that the so-called South Lebanese Army ( SLA ) militia is responsible for the detention camp of Al-Khyam is totally refuted and unacceptable and does not exonerate it from responsibility since Israel is the occupying Power in south Lebanon and is , in the final analysis , responsible in international law for acts committed on the territories it occupies and the SLA militia is but a tool of the Israeli occupying force and would not exist without its support . 
However , the United States Administration , together with the south Korean puppet army , has , since 1976 , staged " team spirit " joint military exercises against us each year , mobilizing nuclear weapons instead of coming to the talks , and even cancelled the already proclaimed reduction plan of American troops in south Korea , in July 1979 .  
The actual size of the two buildings and the link is evident from the south , where sweeping reinforced concrete piers buttress the buildings set diagonally into the steeply sloping hillside .  
El Ni �� is a warm inshore current annually flowing south along the coast of Ecuador around the end of December and extending about every 7 to 10 years down the coast of Peru ; it can bring devastating weather to several global regions , including heavy rains and flooding as well as colder than normal winters across the United States , and severe droughts and dust storms in Australia .  
pointed out that the resolution mentioned above had been adopted on an initiative of the Sudan , motivated by its concern for the situation of more than 20,000 children who had been sequestered by the insurgent movement in the south of the country , which used them as explosives carriers , human shields in minefields and as a military reserve , a situation which was intolerable since it violated religious and humane principles .  
First , the current of the East Sea would have steered a drifting vessel in a northerly direction , while the North Korean submarine moved southwards , against the current , nearly 60 miles south of the demilitarized zone before running aground at our coast near Kangnung .  
I am concerned about the imprudent behaviour of the south Korean representative , as it will lead to intensified confrontation between the north and the south of Korea and have a negative effect on international peace and security as a whole .  
As to paragraph 6 , in which Iraq was accused of impeding the equitable distribution of foodstuffs among the regions , it was completely divorced from reality as clearly reflected in independent international reports ; the latter were eloquent in their praises of the system whereby provisions were delivered to the north , as well as to the centre and the south , without any discrimination . 
The United States is becoming more undisguised in its moves to build up a " tripartite military alliance " with Japan and south Korea , and moves forward on a full scale with the reintroduction of its cold war era policy to the Korean peninsula and its vicinity , by repeatedly launching joint military exercises among the United States , south Korea and Japan over the so-called " north Korea 's threat " .  
Now that north and south Korea have already signed an agreement on non-aggression and inaugurated the north-south joint military body , this detailed proposal of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea , if realized , would bring about an epoch-making environment for d \ x { 5f4b } ente and peace on the Korean peninsula and would also create the prerequisite for a confederal reunification of Korea .  
It is the invalidation by the United States side of the key provisions of the Armistice Agreement that has paved the way for south Korea 's current status as the greatest United States overseas military base and nuclear base .  
To appeal to international organizations and their member States to bring pressure to bear on Israel to pay compensation to Lebanon for the damage caused by its repeated attacks on Lebanese territory and to take action to halt the inhumane and oppressive Israeli practices against the peaceful inhabitants of occupied Lebanese territory in the south and the western Bekaa ;  
In the meantime , Mr . Cassoulides , the official spokesman of the Greek Cypriot administration , has confirmed that in the context of the so-called " joint defence doctrine " the construction in south Cyprus of an air force base for Greece is effectively under way , and that the existing Paphos airport has already been closed to civilian air traffic for this purpose .  
I should like to inform you that United States warplanes operating from bases in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are continuing to violate the airspace of the Republic of Iraq and are engaging in acts of reconnaissance , breaking the sound barrier and dropping heat flares over public and private property in the north and south of Iraq , causing damage and spreading alarm among the civilian population .  
Despite the satisfactory economic performance and the progress and acceleration of reconstruction , Israel 's continuous occupation of south Lebanon and its continued aggression against Lebanon and its citizens remain the major obstacle to comprehensive national recovery . 
Instead of descending by the east coast of Florida , they crossed the Florida peninsula to Key West and from there moved south , then west all of this within the region under United States air traffic control and then follow a straight line to the capital of Cuba .  
More recently , the humanitarian situation has seriously deteriorated as a result of renewed intense fighting in the north-western provinces of Bubanza and Cibitoke , the outbreak of fighting in the south , increased massacres of civilians by both rebels and the Armed Forces , and the initially forceful repatriation by local Burundian authorities of large numbers of Rwandan refugees in the north-east .  
In October 1995 , fighting increased in intensity between rival factions in the city , causing the country 's main port in south Mogadishu to cease functioning and to have a negative effect on the flow of humanitarian assistance to the city and to the interior regions of the country .  
Community-based animal health workers continued to vaccinate cattle against rinderpest - a major cattle-killing disease - and treat other major livestock diseases of the south : contagious bovine pleuro-pneumonia , trypanosomiasis , liver fluke , anthrax and haemorrhagic septicaemia .  
For our part , we declared on 3 September 1996 that the illusory lines to the north of the 36th parallel and to the south of the 32nd parallel are considered null and void , and Iraq will act on this basis .  
Over half a century of occupation of south Korea by United States military forces has created the tragedy of a divided nation , put grave obstacles in the way of peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula , even in the current post-cold war era , and inflicted immeasurable misery and suffering on the entire Korean population .  
In fact , his real reasons for presenting such a report are political , and completely unrelated to human rights issues ; rather , they are connected with the conspiracy to divide Iraq by imposing the no-fly zones in the north and the south of the country .  
In this paragraph , Van der Stoel betrays his intentions and his established bad faith : how otherwise can these claims that there are no special circumstances in Iraq be interpreted , when he knows perfectly well that Iraq has been facing a hostile situation and experiencing unrest , quite apart from having to endure gross violations of its sovereignty and territorial integrity due to the imposition by certain of the allied States of the no-fly zones in the north and south of Iraq , and direct military intervention ?  
The emergency joint meeting adopted a decision on taking strong countermeasures in response to the dangerous manoeuvre of the Kim Yong Sam cliques who are misusing the recently occurred accident during a training mission , aggravating the north-south confrontation and driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war in succession to the brutal crackdown on the peaceful unification events organized by the students of " Han Chong Ryon " of south Korea on 15 August 1996 by unreasonably relating those to us . 
When the south Korean puppets brutally cracked down on the patriotic pro-reunification events of the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils and students around 15 August with the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of combat police and injured and imprisoned thousands of them in an anti-communist fascist frenzy against the north , we controlled ourselves and hoped they would act with reason .  
Respect for the right of the Iraqi population to food and adequate health care was also called into question by the rationing system set up by the Government , which protected the elite of the Baath Party and the Iraqi military , but served as a way of subjugating the population to discourage any opposition and retaliating against the population in the south of the country , which was suspected of being hostile to the Iraqi regime .  
The question of displaced persons has been fundamentally settled between the two sides through the agreement on the exchange of populations reached between the two sides at the third round of the intercommunal talks held at Vienna from 31 July and 2 August 1975 , whereby the two sides agreed on a voluntary regrouping of populations , each in its own respective territory , the Turkish Cypriots in the north and the Greek Cypriots in the south ( see S / 11789 of 5 August 1975 ) . 
This form of action has been of special importance in view of the precarious social and economic situation , which has been compounded by the impact on the country of mandatory sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the unilateral economic blockade from the south . 
I am sure it is obvious to all persons living in the south that the economic , social and political isolation imposed upon us has been counter-productive as this treatment has helped us to get stronger on our feet and to find adequate alternatives for self-existence , all of which help to consolidate and give permanence to the division of the island .  
This millennial tension has left its mark to the north , south , east and west of this middle sea still beleaguered by numerous political , economic , social , humanitarian and environmental problems .  
The continuing rearmament programme in south Cyprus , construction of an air base in Paphos and the planned purchase of medium and long-range missiles are clearly offensive steps , rather than defensive as alleged by the Greek Cypriot side , and constitute a serious provocation towards the Turkish Cypriot side and Turkey .  
The inhuman social , economic and racial discrimination suffered by Turkish Cypriots in the south has also recently been highlighted by the Greek Cypriot press Alithia , in its 30 December 1996 edition , also reported on the dire living conditions of the Turkish Cypriot community of Limassol .  
To condemn Israel in the strongest terms for its persistence in making repeated attacks on Lebanese territory ; and to appeal to the international community , international organizations and their member States to bring pressure to bear on Israel to pay compensation to Lebanon for the damage caused by its repeated attacks on Lebanese territory , particularly for the attack it launched against Lebanon during April 1996 , and to take action to halt the inhumane and oppressive Israeli practices against the peaceful inhabitants of occupied Lebanese territory in the south and the western Bekaa ;  
Reflecting the requirements of the situation prevailing at the time , the respected leader Comrade Kim Il Sung , in his speech on 6 August 1971 , advanced the policy of new , wide-ranging negotiations whereby we were ready to come into contact at any time with all political parties including the ruling " Democratic Republican Party " , social organizations and individual personages of south Korea . 
The DCRK is a unified State of a confederal form in which a unified national Government is established on condition that the north and the south recognize and tolerate each other 's ideas and systems , a Government in which the two sides are represented on an equal footing and under which they exercise regional autonomy respectively with equal power of authority and duties . 
The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung elucidated in an all-round way the questions on the founding of the DCRK , including the problem of forming a supreme national confederal assembly with an equal number of representatives from the north and the south and an appropriate number of representatives of overseas nationals under which a confederal standing committee is organized to discuss and decide on common issues related to the overall interests of the country and nation . 
Upon the initiative of the respected leader , a proposal was made in August 1981 to hold a Conference for the Promotion of National Reunification , with the participation of the representatives of the political parties and organizations from the north , the south and the overseas compatriots and to convene a joint conference in February 1982 to be attended by 100 persons , including politicians from the north , the south and overseas .  
Even under the situation where the United States and the south Korean authorities defiantly opposed the DPRK 's proposal for tripartite talks , the great leader took the positive step of mobilizing 150,000 Korean People 's armymen for peaceful construction in 1986 to defuse the tension on the Korean peninsula and advanced a proposal on 23 July 1987 for a massive phased reduction of the armed forces and declared a unilateral reduction of 100,000 of the People 's Army forces as a subsequent practical measure .  
At the beginning of the 1990s , the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung took the landmark initiative of demolishing the concrete walls built up on the south side of the military demarcation line , allowing free travel between the north and the south , and holding north-south high-level talks and the north-south summit talks to remove the root cause of the war and accelerate the process of peaceful reunification on the Korean peninsula in the next few years .  
The extensive fighting in the north and south of the country has displaced a significant proportion of the population and made it difficult for humanitarian aid agencies to conduct a consistent and effective relief programme .  
As already reported , the recent incident is , in essence , a part of the current reckless provocation moves of the south Korean chief executive to look for a way out of a most serious ruling crisis in a shocking incident and to delay his doomed life .  
Such a dramatic development as the current incident could be avoidable if the United States would not leave the maintenance of the demilitarized zone entirely to the south Korean puppets , insisting only on new war provocation , while neglecting our proposal for establishing an interim agreement that can replace the obsolete Korean Armistice Agreement , and for Democratic People 's Republic of Korea / United States military general-level talks . 
While crying for the introduction of diversified military equipment , the south Korean authorities are now shipping modern tanks , armoured vehicles , anti-aircraft missiles , anti-tank missiles and helicopters from the Russian Federation as well as the United States , Harpy unmanned attack planes from Israel and huge military equipment from many countries around the world .  
The gap in socio-economic development between the countries of the south and north of the region is widening , there remains in the area a critical mass of combustible material the Middle East conflict and the as yet unsettled Cyprus problem , and there is a high level of saturation with weapons , accompanied by the danger of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .  
At the recent XII Ministerial Conference of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries , held at New Delhi , which concluded just a little over two weeks ago , the Non-Aligned Movement member countries had the privilege of hearing President Arafat in a special session of the ministerial conference , give a detailed presentation on the state of the peace process in the Middle East and the implications of the construction of the settlement by Israel at Jabal Abu Ghneim to the south of East Jerusalem . 
It also refers to the arbitrary and coercive measures undertaken against the Arab population , such as administrative detention , collective punishment , the demolition of homes , curfews , the forcible transfer of Bedouin population , closures , impeding the free movement of people and , in particular , the restriction that prevents them from travelling through Jerusalem between the north and south of the country .  
With the appointment of regional alternative development advisers posted in south and south-east Asia and Latin America and strengthened expertise in alternative development at headquarters , UNDCP has underlined its commitment to supporting alternative development as a viable tool for reducing illicit crop cultivation .  
Many developing countries , particularly in Africa south of the Sahara , continue to lack a sufficient level of national scientific capacity including a critical mass of well-trained scientists , technicians and engineers , which is required to generate scientific inventions and produce technological innovation , and to adapt and absorb technologies .  
Variances may occur to the actual physical distribution as a result of changes in cropping patterns , varying food demands , weather restrictions , location of weed , insect and disease infestations , future machinery malfunctions that were not foreseen , the number of contracts approved and / or blocked , plus seasonal machinery activities ( e.g . the majority of harvesters move to the south for the early harvest and migrate north as the crops ripen and become ready for harvest ) .  
On 21 October 1996 , at 10.08 hours , crew members of scheduled flight CU-170 of Cubana de Aviaci \ x { 93ee } ( Cuban Airlines ) , on board a Fokker-27 aircraft , flying the Havana-Las Tunas route , upon crossing the Gir \ x { 93ee } air corridor in the western region of Cuba , noticed a single-engine airplane flying from north to south , at about 1,000 feet ( 300 metres ) above them , apparently spraying or sprinkling unknown substances - some seven times - in an intermittent manner .  
The argument put forward by Israel , that the so-called South Lebanese Army militia is responsible for the detention camp of Khiam , is totally refuted and unacceptable and does not exonerate it from responsibility , since Israel is the occupying power in south Lebanon and is , in the final analysis , responsible in international law for acts committed on the territories it occupies .  
This suffices to prove that the present authorities of south Korea have pursued a more vicious policy of confrontation and war against the northern half of Korea than preceding military fascist regimes .  
Furthermore , arms sales to south Cyprus also constitute a violation of the 1993 Principles Governing Conventional Arms Transfers of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) , where it is categorically stated that each participating State has to consider " the internal and regional situation in and around the recipient country , in the light of existing tensions or armed conflicts " and are obliged to " avoid transfers which would be likely to endanger peace , introduce destabilizing military capabilities into a region , or otherwise contribute to regional instability " .  
The programme activities of UNDCP are contained in seven programmes by geographic region plus one global programme : sub-Saharan Africa ; north Africa and the Middle East ; central and eastern Europe ; west and central Asia ; south Asia ; east Asia and the Pacific ; and Latin America and the Caribbean .  
From north to south and east to west , passing through Central Africa , the clash of arms and the sound of bombs effectively beat out the rhythm of daily life in that ailing continent .  
The economic and social factors include : widespread loss of human life , destruction of social and economic infrastructure , environmental degradation , food insecurity and malnutrition _ with the additional losses caused by the floods and earthquakes which struck south _ western and north _ eastern Afghanistan in 1998 _ high levels of unemployment and poverty , and further increases in illicit drug production .  
The Committee is concerned about the disparities of living standards , especially with regard to education , health , life expectancy , child mortality , access to piped water and electricity and employment , to be found between the prosperous north _ east coast of Tunisia and the underdeveloped north _ west , between the interior of the country and the south , and between the towns and rural areas .  
On 9 March 1999 , the oil overseers informed the Security Council Committee that during the second half of phase V the increase in the total level of exports , accompanied by the corresponding exports from both the north and the south of Iraq , had led to an increase in the share of crude oil exported from Mina al-Bakr .  
It is also keeping the U . S . marine units based in Okinawa , Japan , and the aircraft carrier Constellation , F-15 tactical fighters , B-52 strategic bombers and EA-6B electronic warfare aircraft based in its mainland on standby for rapid deployment in south Korea .  
The present ruler of south Korea asserted openly on several occasions that " sunshine " capable of melting away the other party , not " strong wind " , meaning head-on confrontation , would be more effective for " undressing " the north , saying that it was not the cold war , but the " appeasement policy " of the United States that caused the collapse of the former Soviet Union and that it is the " engagement policy " that induced a certain country to " reform " and " opening " . 
If true reconciliation and cooperation are to be realized , mutual visits should be effected between the north and the south of Korea and free discussion and activities by patriotic organizations for reunification ensured .  
Korea should be reunified by a confederate formula on the basis of three principles of independence , peaceful reunification and great national unity , which the north and south agreed upon and solemnly declared at home and abroad , and according to the Ten-Point Programme for the great unity of the entire nation .  
" The Sudan has witnessed important political and constitutional developments in the last 10 years , including the Peace Agreement , which includes the right to and self-determination for south Sudan , dialogue over national reconciliation , political pluralism , the positive developments in the country 's relations with its neighbours and the European Union and close cooperation with the United Nations in humanitarian issues and human rights .  
There were only 90 Dobson units total column ozone at the centre , almost all lower stratospheric ozone was destroyed , and about one third of the total ozone in the middle stratosphere was unaffected . 73 This is a reduction of about 70 per cent of the total ozone in years prior to when the hole was first observed . 75 The region of enhanced ozone destruction is mainly confined to the area polewards from about latitude 60 degrees south . 
Arms transfers and trafficking , and the resulting armed conflicts which they feed , are having a devastating impact on social , political and economic life for Africa south of the Sahara , a region endowed with natural resources but which still has pockets in which live the poorest people in the world today . 
Situated on the crossroads between the east and the west , the north and the south of the continent , Belarus will be further contributing to international cooperation in combating transborder crime , terrorism and illicit drug trafficking .  
It is also important that in the region of north and south America a reliable information and data network be set up which would make it possible to establish a warning system to prevent illicit trafficking and to coordinate action to counter and curb such trafficking , including the tracing of networks and organized rings .  
With fresh confidence and courage , the entire Korean people in the north , the south and overseas will spur the national reunification movement and build a reunified , prosperous and powerful State in the near future .  
If any costs are to be apportioned , they must be borne by all the parties concerned . 4 . All must respect the sovereignty , security and independence of Iraq in a responsible manner and must refrain from interfering in its internal affairs , first and foremost by eliminating the illegal no-flight zones in the north and south of the country .  
On 6 January 1993 , the United States , the United Kingdom and France each handed our Permanent Representative in New York a written position in which , after making reference to the imposition of a no-fly zone south of parallel 32 , they stated that Iraqi military aircraft had been recurrently observed in the said zone in violation of the no-fly zone and that Iraq had moved SAM missile batteries to new sites south of parallel 32 , thus posing a threat to the aircraft of those States .  
They demanded that the missile batteries be withdrawn and returned to their original sites within 48 hours of the date of the above position ; that there should be no flights of any civilian or military fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters south of the 32 nd parallel ; and that Iraq should undertake no illumination or tracing by radar of any aircraft and should flash no signals indicating a hostile intention .  
Participants affirmed that national sovereignty should not be exercised at the expense of respect for human rights , and that real efforts towards the co-development of countries north and south of the Mediterranean , as well as the strengthening of the rule of law , would contribute to reducing erratic migratory flows and facilitate economic cooperation , mutual understanding and cultural exchanges .  
During the past six months , fighting continued in south Lebanon and the situation in the area remained volatile , although the level of hostility was somewhat reduced and civilian casualties decreased .  
They also result in inequities in international economic relations and in a widening gap between the rich developed countries of the north and the poor developing countries of the south , where 80 per cent of the worlds poorest live .  
During the summit , there was a general consensus of the urgent need for the implementation of an immediate ceasefire in the areas of military operation in southern Sudan in order to accelerate the flow of humanitarian assistance to the needy civilian population in those areas , and to facilitate for constructive negotiations between the Government and the rebel movement ( SPLM / A ) , with the ultimate aim of reaching a peaceful resolution of the conflict in the south . 
My Governments continued call for a comprehensive ceasefire in the war-affected areas in the south will obviously , if implemented , alleviate the suffering of the civilian population in those areas and provide a conducive atmosphere for a peaceful settlement of the conflict .
