Then there 's immigration and overseas investment by the private sector plus government loans and aid to foreign countries , such as that provided by the International Economic Cooperation Development Fund .  
Chinese based abroad were particularly concerned about China 's poverty at the turn of the century and gave generously in support of Sun Yatsen 's nationalist revolution . Overseas Chinese newspaper proprietors encouraged revolutionary sentiment ; Singapore Chinese Chang Yung-fu lent his home as a meeting place for the Tung Meng Hui , and Sun Yatsen stayed there when he visited Singapore ; Vietnam-based overseas Chinese bought ammunition to assist nationalist forces at the Battle of Huanghuakang in the year 1911 , and in that battle some dozen of them gave their lives for the revolutionary cause .  
Trade and business contacts , academic scholarly exchange , events sponsored by private groups , and overseas tourism by ordinary citizens are all channels for showing people overseas the good side of our people and for demonstrating the united effort being made inside and outside government . This is how a good international image is built up .  
Currently , the editors at Sinorama have set their three main directions as " the domestic pulse , " " traditional culture , " and " overseas reports , " in order to serve as a link for the aspirations of Chinese home and abroad and to truly become a comprehensive and international publication which " has its footing in Taiwan , is concerned about the mainland , and has its eyes open to the world . "  
From the anxious youth of Lou Ti , to the love of home and country of the overseas student of Women ti Ke , the broken dream of returning home in Fei-ts'ui Chieh-chih , up to the coming together of China and the West in the period of the Boxer Rebellion , Chao Shu-hsia has written down the heavy burden of her own heart while also speaking out about the sorrow and suffering of the overseas Chinese .  
Their letter was earnest . The gist of it was that they felt close to the characters in my books and very much wanted to talk with me . . . . There was only a scattering of overseas Chinese in Europe 27 or 28 years ago , and the term " overseas Chinese community " was practically unheard of . As few as we were , under the shadow of the political climate of the time , we fell into two clearly defined camps , the line crossed only by a handful .  
Despite his special fondness for the garden , he actually spent more of his time away from home involved with exhibitions and such during his 20 years there ( from 1953 to 1973 , when he immigrated to the United States ) - - except for a time after France established diplomatic relations with Communist China ( his main overseas market was Europe ) , when he stayed holed up at home and did n't care to travel about much .  
But overseas surveys have shown baldness is spreading " up top " in highly civilized countries among high-density urban populations and overstressed workers . It 's more and more common for people talented and handsome in their youth to be struck by baldness with the onset of middle age , and growing numbers of people are worried about hair loss once they turn 25 .  
Wu Kuang-ting , for many years secretary of overseas Chinese affairs at the ROC embassy , explains : " There are three such chief justices in Panama , each nominated by the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government respectively . Because they are responsible for overseeing the elections they must enjoy impeccable reputations . That Luis Chen was the nomination of the executive branch shows how highly he was regarded by the former government . "  
It 's not like a lot of magazines that just skim over things superficially and after you 're done you ca n't remember a word you 've read . That two seasoned reporters spent three hours of their time interviewing for an article of something over l , 000 words with two photographs shows admirable dedication . Competition overseas must be intense , and it 's not easy for a magazine to be held in esteem both at home and abroad .  
According to Council for Economic Planning and Development member Wu Chia-hsing , the main reason for Korea going into the red has been fulfilment of the government 's election pledges . With the construction of two million houses in the public sector domestic demand has diverted glass , concrete and steel from exports and even led to their being imported from overseas .  
Some grown-up " overseas students , " who have fulfilled their military obligations or finished junior college in Taiwan , have organized a club for them called the Chinese Youth Association . Besides holding lots of outdoor activities to let them work off steam so they can fall asleep as soon as their head touches the pillow when they get home , the older members help the students with their homework or find doctors or lawyers for them in case of emergencies . "  
Do n't Let the Orchids Wither : Given the current world situation , we do n't have a lot of support from other countries in returning to the U . N . right now , as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found out by inquiring through its agencies overseas . On the other hand , regional and economic international organizations have been growing more and more important since the end of the Cold War .  
As for the R . O . C . , which has deep ties with both Berkeley and Dr . Tien - - he graduated from Kien Kuo senior high school and National Taiwan University before going to the U . S . and Berkeley boasts more members of Academia Sinica than any other university overseas - - the Ministry of Education , the Legislative Yuan and the private sector have donated US $ 3 million since his appointment was announced in support of its research on East Asia and other broad academic areas . "  
The formal features of overseas Chinese buildings in Malaysia come from southern Fukien , reflecting the deep historical ties that the local immigrants have with China proper .  
However , the ownership of the publishing rights overseas is rather complex . Sometimes the rights belong to the writer , sometimes to the publishing house , and sometimes to an agent . " If you 're not familiar with the terrain , for publishers without any experience negotiating international publishing rights , it is very easy to look in the wrong places for partners , " says Luc Kwanten , executive vice president of the Big Apple Tuttle-Mori Agency , which has been operating for five years .  
" The system of agents has long been in place abroad , and is the long-term trend , " explains Luc Kwanten . For people overseas who have the publishing rights , dealing with a single agent saves a great deal of trouble over negotiating with individual publishers whose operating situations are unclear . For the domestic publishing industry , going through an agency saves even more in expenses than setting up your own publishing rights department or hiring specially trained negotiators . "  
Ten years ago , to help children that have been unable to receive proper parental care because their families have suffered special problems or misfortunes , the R . O . C . Children 's Welfare Foundation studied examples overseas and introduced to Taiwan the foster care system , in which families volunteer to take in foster children on a temporary basis .  
It would be nice if Chinese living overseas could share more of what they have learned with each other , especially French cuisine , which is world famous - - I expect that French cooking is more attractive than jus cheese and salads . As for oysters , judging from my many years of experience work ing in a hospital , it 's best to eat them cooked instead of raw .  
Complementary factors home and abroad : Although the scale and professionalism of overseas markets are key factors in enticing animators to go abroad to develop , if you look carefully at this trend , the larger domestic and external environments are also complementary . "  
For me and many other overseas Chinese living here , Taipei is such a distant place that it 's hard to sense what it must be like , how it 's changed from quiet and tranquility to bustling crowds and prosperity . Life here is a matter of constantly doing our utmost to realize ourselves and raise our oppressed status . It 's just like that passage in " Chinese ?  
I 'm sure the reason many overseas students go bad or give up on themselves is that they 're afraid of being unable to live up to their parents ' expectations , combined with the stress of living overseas and the pressure of getting ahead academically .  
Those days of Williamsport and the " Triple Crown " surely give us some warm memories : the whole family up in front of the TV in the wee hours of the morning to cheer on the team overseas , watching the children coming through the screen from the other side of the world winning the title " world champions " even as those in Taiwan were straining away to get the economy to take off and the country was meeting diplomatic setbacks in the 1970s - - what adult was n't moved to tears ?  
Associate professor Chung Wei-wen of National Chengchi University 's Graduate School of Journalism agrees with this judgement . Yet he still wants to wake up potential overseas students to the fact that knowledge is not a passive thing . When you go abroad , you can see the environment in all its pluralism and complexity , but if you do not have the ability to make acute observations and just hold on to your fixed frame of thinking , then it is like returning empty handed from a mountain of treasures .  
Cheng Shu-min , manager of program planning at Chinese Television System , also says that when you look at examples from overseas , audiences tend to identify with their native culture and we have yet to see terrestrial television stations closing down due to competition from satellite . Yet the rise of new electronic media technology has still made the networks aware of a change in the domestic market , a change which has seen a breaking up of the tripartite world of the three television channels and a movement towards audience fragmentation . "  
For this reason the many arguments expounded in Novel China are mainly presented through analogy and dialogue between large numbers of works , and concentrate on probing the emergence , development and current state of several genre traditions within recent and modern Chinese fiction , including political , local-flavor , overseas student life , science fiction , erotic , feminine consciousness , and others , along with these genres ' aesthetic , social , and cultural implications .  
As Legislator Cheng Chien-jen observes , " the fates of the overseas Chinese and the Republic of China have been closely linked since the Revolution , through the founding of the Republic , the Northern Expedition , the War of Resistance against Japan and the ' Period of Mobilization for Suppressing the Communist Rebellion , ' right up to the present day . " But changing times and the rapid evolution in the domestic and international environment have brought a qualitative and quantitative change in the relationship between Chinese people and their motherland .  
At the end of the Ching dynasty , with the failure of the 100 Days Reform , the reformist royalist protectors Kang Yu-wei and Liang Chi-chao , both Cantonese , fled abroad . They published newspapers and established schools for the overseas Chinese in all kinds of places , stirring up patriotic thinking . It was only then that the Overseas Chinese began to identify with their country and became enthusiastic about politics .  
Japan 's Nik-kei Shinbun carried a report that the foreign exchange reserves of the overseas Chinese of the whole world amount to US $ 300 billion . Britain 's Economist reported that the accrued capital of the Chinese outside mainland China , excluding stock , is US $ 1.5 - - 2 trillion .  
The forgotten people of historyEventually the Japanese came to the view that overseas Chinese organizations posed too serious a threat . Since Kao could not be bought , they played their trump card , forcing him to sell the transit company he ran with relatives . At the same time , the police were assigned to monitor his every move , investigating and questioning anyone he associated with . And so they cut both his access to money and his social network .  
Therefore , despite the fact that most of the people active in his books come from overseas , and his discussion of nativist matters is deeply imbued with western style thought patterns , he establishes a dialectical relationship with his theories ( phenomena ) and readers through his alluring and noble prose , the many levels on which his work can be understood , and his clear and persuasive method of reasoning .  
At that time it was specially stipulated in the land reform law that the houses of overseas Chinese were acquired through their efforts abroad . Except for those houses that were rented out and definitely involved " exploitation " and which had to undergo " national reform , " the government could not confiscate those houses in which the families of overseas Chinese were living or those rented out which did not exceed 150 square meters .  
The policy of actively returning houses has only been going on for the past five years . Many overseas Chinese are scattered abroad , and have only heard about the program in a roundabout fashion before coming to investigate . Also , for example , in 1990 after the PRC established diplomatic relations with Indonesia , a large group of overseas Chinese from there came forward to apply . "  
There has never been a case of a country which establishes a public school in a geographic location belonging to a foreign power . And furthermore Taiwan does not have official diplomatic relations with Indonesia . Chaoalso notes that the overseas schools of America and Japan , although partly subsidized by their respective governments , remain nevertheless private schools . "  
Stories from those days record that those Chinese laborers who risked their very lives to work overseas never failed to mail the money they accumulated back home , to improve the lives of their family . When they had the rare opportunity to return and reunite with their families , inevitably they brought some exotic curiosities , as well as tales of what they had seen and heard in the colorful world abroad , bringing smiles to the faces of loved ones .  
According to Chinese American scholar Him Mark Lai , overseas Chinese , being influenced by American architecture , came back to build a series of structures that combined Western and Chinese influences . Typically , the front half was a blue-gray brick western style building with a flat roof one or two storeys high , while the back half retained the traditional design of an " A " shaped roof composed of fir wood and bricks .  
While overseas he saw many Chinese people in a state of ignorance and superstition , with a low level of cultural cultivation . In his hometown he saw old private schools in a state of decay , and the new Western-style schools corrupt . Many children in the village already over the age of ten were still naked and played in the streets : " It almost returned to a prehistoric state of barbarity .  
Q : After you came back , you devoted yourself to encouraging talented people from Taiwan who now live overseas to return home , and you established the Foundation for Development of Outstanding Fellows . A while back we went to the mainland to conduct interviews and discovered that you are the chairman of the Tan Kah Kee International Institute , which was established in honor of the famous Southeast Asian Chinese who founded Xiamen University .  
As international boundaries become increasingly blurred and the global village becomes a reality , working or living overseas no longer seems unusual . Yet families divided in this way have to confront the risk of dramatic upheaval or even disintegration .  
The broad idea for this was floated two years ago . The hope is that Taiwan can take advantage of its geographic location , orthodox Chinese culture , business connections with overseas Chinese , and solid industrial base to become the regional center for foreign firms coming to the Asian region ( and especially for those firms investing in the PRC ) .  
At any rate , the investment required to open a computer center is not nearly as monumental as a factory or an overseas branch operation . With the use of satellite communications it really was n't that difficult . As far as Hong Kong and Shanghai is concerned , we were simply turning circumstances to our advantage . " Lo reveals that several dozen employees have returned by this method .  
To be fair , the three military drama troupes held many morale-boosting public performances and competitions over the years , which soothed the homesickness of those mainland officers and soldiers who moved to Taiwan early on . They have served overseas to promote Chinese culture , and they have helped prevent the disappearance of the Peking dramatic arts . The problem is that art and the military simply make peculiar bedfellows .  
According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission , there are currently about 260,000 overseas Chinese eligible to register for the presidential election . This figure was arrived at by starting with the number of people who " formerly had legal residence in Taiwan but then moved abroad , " minus the number of minors ( people below 20 ) and deceased persons . ( The latter two figures were calculated on the basis of the percentage of non-adult persons and the death rate in Taiwan . )  
Benjamin Lu , Taiwan 's representative in the US , was even more optimistic in an estimate he made last December while on a trip back to Taiwan . He guessed that 300,000 people living in the US would vote in the presidential election . ( His guess exceeded the theoretical limit of 260,000 because he also considered the number of ROC citizens in the US who still have legal residence in Taiwan , and thus are not included in the estimate of 260,000 eligible " overseas Chinese . "  
On one occasion , a KMT candidate in the southern part of the island held an outdoor rally , but cold weather kept voters at home . Fortunately the 80-plus strong overseas support group showed up , saving the candidate from a rather embarrassing situation .  
" In future , newspapers should be competing on quality , not price , " says Simon Cheng , observing that compared with major newspapers overseas which cost at least NT $ 30-40 , newspapers in the ROC have always been cheap . When a number of honestly-run newspapers in Hong Kong were forced out of business by cutthroat competition in a price war last year , it was the readers who suffered in the end .  
In recent years , wild animals raised in captivity have been given more living space and more natural surroundings . Still , says Marcus Phipps of TRAFFIC , there are still some extremist animal rights groups overseas who wish to close all zoos and sea-world theme parks , with the goal of returning the animals to their natural habitats .  
Chiang Kuan-feng feels that on this occasion the issuing of invitations was " broad and deep . " Equal attention was given to the central government and the localities ; professional , religious , and social groups were all included ; and even overseas Chinese were given as fair a distribution of RSVPs as possible . As for how many people could or would come , it was hard to say . The only thing to do was keep calling the contact people for each group and ask , " What will your attendance rate be ? "  
While other dancers were abroad studying foreign techniques , she went overseas several times to collect materials - - including hand-written copies of ancient choreographic notation - - on ancient Chinese music and dance . She reconstructed and staged many old works . She also created modern dance based on these materials .  
The communist authorities in mainland China continue to spare no efforts to maintain Mao 's exalted status and to gloss over his monstrous crimes , refusing to rattle at his halo , and even overseas some people are enraptured by Mao 's nationalism and idealism , and blind to his basically treacherous and despotic nature .  
The assistant general manager of Mingtung , a Mr . Chang , points out that overseas Chinese account for only about half of the Western demand . When he went to Europe to lecture about Chinese medicine , many caucasian physical therapists and other medical professionals attended his classes . In Germany and Switzerland some Chinese medicines have already been certified .  
Perhaps a passage by veteran reporter Ku Meng-jen , written as a commentary on Chong Shu 's novel The Chinese People , is particularly apropos : " From the Chinese laborers of the past to the immigrants of today , from the narrow alleys of Chinatown to present-day Silicon Valley , the peregrine steps of the overseas Chinese on the one hand reflect the changes of the times , and on the other hand express the growth of the Chinese people in foreign society .  
In other words , even though the production base moves overseas , the " headquarters " and " logistical support center " remain in Taiwan . Operations items stay in Taiwan , along with capital sourcing , legal , tax , and financial planning , and training of internationalized personnel . All these could service the production bases located in surrounding countries .  
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan - tseh believes that achievements in scholarship within Taiwan depend to a great extent on cooperative efforts between academics at home and abroad . As the gap with overseas scholarship is closed , the number of Taiwan-resident scholars elected to the Academia Sinica will increase , and more overseas scholars will be willing to return to Taiwan . The most important thing is to make contributions toward academic development in Taiwan , and the only standard of judgment should be the level of academic work .  
Even after you have graduated from university or graduate school , there are still all kinds of career-training buxibans that will help you cross over to a new profession , prepping you for the national civil service exam , TOEFL , overseas university entrance exams , qualifying licensing examinations , and even specialized tests for journalism or the foreign service .  
But it also proved to be a turning point , for " to save the situation , the New Zealand government stepped in and set up the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board ( NZKMB ) . This replaced the former system of multiple exporters , and introduced a unified approach to the business , with global coordination covering every stage from improved cultivar selection to production , packing , cool storage , transport , shipping , overseas distribution , marketing and promotion , " says NZKMB new project manager Stuart Abbott .  
Meanwhile , the main regulations governing Taiwan 's relations with Hong Kong have been largely completed . July 1997 will not merely be a starting point for Tung and the people of Hong Kong . Taiwanese , mainland Chinese , overseas Chinese , and Asia-watchers everywhere are waiting with bated breath . Tung is indeed bearing an unprecedented historical burden .  
Of ' Mui 's twin sons Huegu ( Chang Hui-kuo ) and ' Api , the one plays guitar to a professional standard , and the other has been described as an excellent singer ever since he was in elementary school . Once he was grown up , ' Api was hired by several tourist " culture villages " in Hualien County as a singing and dancing instructor . He has frequently gone overseas to represent his local area in international aboriginal singing and dancing performances .  
When the floodgates were later opened , the floodwater receded within half-an-hour , leaving behind a thick layer of mud and incalculable damage . Afterwards , as Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian was on vacation overseas , Deputy Mayor Lin Chia-cheng made a statement which asserted that human error had been involved in the Tahu flood . Bureau of Public Works Director Hsu Jui-feng has agreed to take the blame for this incident , and Office of City Parks &amp; Street Lights Director Chang Ching , as well as five of his subordinates , have received demerits .  
Through long-term arrangements by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and overseas representative offices , Vice President Lien Chan conducted his second visit to Europe under the low profile of a " holiday " and " private visit . " He made substantive , face-to-face contact with a nation with which the ROC does not have diplomatic ties , and established the critical beginnings of friendship and progressive exchange . The incessant actions of Beijing are additional proof of the barriers which the ROC currently faces in foreign relations .  
" In 1982 Chien Ssu-liang , who was then president of the Academia Sinica , visited the East Coast of the United States and gathered together a group of us overseas members of the Academia Sinica , " Luke Yuan recalls . " He noted that Taiwan was doing pretty well in terms of applied science-using science to advance industrial and commercial development . But in basic research , especially in fields dependent on scientific experiments , Taiwan was quite weak . He asked us for our opinions and advice . "  
In the case of travel , people are not satisfied with what domestic trips have to offer and are going abroad , increasing the amount of money Taiwanese spend on overseas travel . In 1996 , 5.71 million Taiwanese traveled abroad spending a total of US $ 8.15 billion , an amount equal to 46% of what Taiwan earned from trade in that year .  
In later years , although Taiwan had made tremendous progress relative to its situation 25 years before , the difficulties it faced in raising funds overseas were proportional to those it faced in surviving internationally , and this created more problems for the center . Moreover , domestically , the island was entering the democratic era . Most citizens , including the legislators who held the purse-strings , did n't understand the importance of the center and its contribution to the world . Consequently , the budget was cut repeatedly .  
In addition to improving the quality and quantity of vegetable production , its efforts allowed young soybeans to become a major agricultural export for Taiwan , which improved farmers ' incomes and earned foreign exchange for the country . Chou says that the center has also , over the years , nurtured a large pool of skilled personnel from both overseas and Taiwan .  
Just our bad luck to be born at the wrong time ! " But what does fill them with rage and disgust is " intentional bankruptcies " - - when unscrupulous bosses , under the pretense that business is bad , allow factories to go broke , while in secret they have long since arranged to move production overseas or to transfer assets out of the company . Some even close down the existing company and start up under another name to avoid having to pay workers ' retirement bonuses .  
He reminisces , thinking back to some of the measures that led to Taiwan 's current level of development . All of these policies , whether the all-out effort to develop the local IC industry , the establishment of the " one-stop shopping " science-based industrial parks , the importation of the concept of venture capitalism or the incentives to high-tech investment that the government provided , were hammered out in discussions between government strategists and Chinese who had studied and worked overseas .  
Liu Tseng-kui , a research associate at the Academia Sinica 's Institute of History and Philology , created History Links ' basic structure out of his personal collection of website bookmarks , accumulated over years of combing overseas websites for historical data for his research . In the course of his research , Liu discovered that while there was no dearth of literary and historical websites in Taiwan , there were few online collections of links to such sites . He therefore assembled his own site last year , dividing his vast collection of bookmarks into categories .  
In 1994 and 1995 , the question of whether Japan should take on a greater military role in Asia stirred intense controversy in many Asian countries . At that time , Lee Kwan Yew stated in no uncertain terms to American and Japanese news media that he was opposed to a stronger overseas role for the Japanese military . In stating his opposition , he told of his own terrifying experiences during the Japanese occupation of Singapore , and even spoke of a dark side to Japanese culture .  
During Premier Siew 's visit to Belize however , many overseas Chinese reported threats to their personal safety and property , or discrimination when passing through immigration . Premier Siew reported this to Prime Minister Musa , and instructed the ROC embassy to take care of local overseas Chinese . At the same time he emphasized that all embassies and consulates should give equal treatment to Chinese from the mainland in those countries with diplomatic ties to the ROC .  
The program proved extremely popular and was aired for a full two years . Many of the documentary films used were collected by John Hei on trips overseas , and sometimes the ROC military even borrowed such material for information purposes .  
MIOD president Robert Chen says that in recent years the RMI has made developing the fishing industry one of the main planks of its economic development strategy , and to foster overseas investment it is encouraging international joint ventures .  
This approach of marrying outside capital and technology with the rich local marine resources is one of the more feasible models by which the Taiwanese fishing industry , faced with limited opportunities at home , can develop overseas operations . The RMI , which has just established diplomatic relations with the ROC , is an ideal place for such investment .  
In the 1980s , in a China undergoing reform and liberalization and stressing intellectual liberation and the May Fourth spirit of enlightenment , eminent mainland scholar Wang Yuanhua responded to an overseas scholars ' assertion that the radical thinking of May Fourth Movement figures was expressed in " all-round rejection of tradition " with the following words : " What the May Fourth Movement was up against was a feudalism which had been the ruling ideology for thousands of years . . . . Hence to rebel against it required a much greater effort . "  
Thanks to this explanation and analysis , readers can understand everything from the works of Shakespeare to the lives of Taiwan 's aborigines , from the views of the Dalai Lama , to those of the overseas Chinese singing star Lee-hom Wang . There is international news and also domestic news . Some of it 's serious , and some of it 's trendy . These English-instruction magazines attest to the fact that Taiwanese appetites for information are getting larger and increasingly varied !  
But as Hsueh Cheng-tai points out , when you consider the daily routine of most foreign workers and how little free time it leaves them for breaking the law , and bear in mind that the crime rate among illegal foreign workers is far higher than for the legal ones , the problem does indeed merit attention . Especially given that in 1997 rape accounted for the largest share of serious crime committed by overseas workers , causing widespread anxiety among the public .  
Assistance also comes from locals who have long been active in the labor and human rights movements , such as Yvonne Lin , who for nearly ten years has helped foreign laborers stuck in detention centers to get back to their home countries . Lin says that caring for the lives of working people is a cause that transcends nationality , and that disputes between overseas workers and their employers often simply highlight problems already faced by Taiwanese workers . Tackling such problems can help to pave the way for improved rights all round .  
But Taiwanese companies are inexperienced in this area , and sending products overseas for quality certification tests is time consuming and complicated , so local companies can only stand and watch as the entire market goes to imported products .  
Nevertheless , it was hard to resist . Souls locked up for the decade of the Cultural Revolution had lost interest in so-called revolutionary songs that " put politics in command . " Some mainland Chinese with overseas connections brought Teresa Teng 's music into the PRC . Her delicate and warm voice radiated feelings of intimacy , love , and nostalgia , touching the natural feelings that had been suppressed for so long .  
In autobiographical notes which Liu wrote a few years ago for the benefit of his many local and overseas visitors , he outlined his career prior to founding Biographical Literature : " Liu Shao-tang ( original name Liu Tsung-hsiang ) ; ancestral home Lutai , Hebei Province ; born in Jin County , Liaoning Province , on the 14th day of the ninth lunar month , 1921 .  
Taking as a precedent his approach to the Mass Rapid Transit System when he was mayor of Taipei , Chen says that during the mayoral elections he opposed the embryonic mass transit system , but he did not tear it down just to fulfill a campaign promise . Instead , he organized a group of experts from Taiwan and overseas to investigate the system , and , he says , resolved the problems by improving the MRTS .  
Few people are aware that in many Chinese restaurants overseas , almost every item of decor , from the paneled ceilings and intricately carved wooden ornamental windows to the floral-medallion-pattern carpet and the lions outside the door , is the work of Taiwan 's China Palace Art and Painting Company , owned and managed by the Sung family , and that most of these items were handmade in Taiwan before being shipped out by the container load .  
To a Chinese , all these things seem vaguely familiar , yet also bizarre and alien . Today , as the world grows ever smaller , the Chinese style expressed overseas still has an element of the romance of a declining empire . But the appearance of today 's Chinese palaces is no longer so phantasmagorical , and they are no longer reserved for the sole enjoyment of royalty and rich folk .  
Perhaps the most interesting part of this temple is to the right of the main hall . The space there contains more than 8000 ancestral tablets for the deceased . This was a space built by the Chinese gold workers and business people of those bygone days as their resting place for the afterlife . It is the largest extant collection of memorial tablets in any overseas Chinese society in Asia .  
NGOs overseas have pressured their governments to adopt certain restrictions . Moreover , scientists opposed to genetic engineering frequently air their views , and this soul-searching within the scientific community has placed certain " in-house " checks upon the direction of development . " There has been almost no public debate at all in Taiwan on this subject , " says Lin , who laments the low level of concern in Taiwan over genetic science and its applications .  
In this way , the western part of the Southeast Asian littoral came within China 's sphere of influence . Furthermore , there were great profits to be had . Each expedition set out laden with silk and porcelain , to be exchanged for rare and precious commodities from overseas , and this too helps to explain why Zheng set sail on seven separate voyages .  
" National sovereignty " is reflected in a country 's ability to engage in diplomatic relations , but in this most critical area for national survival , Taiwan has long been suffering from PRC efforts to undercut Taiwan 's international status . Indeed , as Levi C . Ying , an overseas Chinese legislator from the New Party , says , mainland China is the only real obstacle and enemy to Taiwan 's foreign relations .  
As Lo says , " The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly . " In the future , overseas offices of the ROC will undertake functional integration at the continental level , with different locations having different specialties , such as overseas Chinese affairs , political affairs , and media relations . All the offices in a particular region will be linked into a single , more efficient , and more richly endowed cooperative group .  
Q : Taiwan firms have always been cooperative , and overseas investment has been very helpful to the ROC 's diplomatic work . But today the government is putting political considerations first in encouraging Taiwan firms to invest in friendly countries . From an economic point of view , how effective is this ?  
A : Of all the wealthy and powerful countries in the world today , there is not one that does not employ overseas investment to maximize the efficiency of factors of production and to develop overseas markets . In so doing , they achieve the dual goals of improving the domestic industrial structure and raising their international economic position .  
In the early 1980s his book A Preliminary Discussion of the Art of Modern Fiction made him a celebrity in Beijing cultural circles , and was known as one of the " four beautiful kites launched into China 's broad , lonely skies . " But because the ideas in the book went against the officially promoted doctrine of social realism , and tended towards Western modernism , Gao 's work was suppressed by the communist authorities and he went into exile overseas .  
However , Columbia University professor and literary critic Wang Dewei feels that Gao Xingjian is a highly innovative writer with original ideas , and that a combination of factors including his fame overseas , his literary status , his creative style and his accessibility surely make him a fitting choice to receive the prize , whether on behalf of Chinese authors or of writers in exile .  
Nonetheless , compared with other Asian countries , Taiwanese people 's sense of their own good fortune is subdued . Recently the media have frequently pinpointed rising " discomfort indicators , " focusing on unemployment , the departure of industry overseas , falling stock prices and an adverse economic outlook , so that people are dogged by anxieties .  
Wu admits that university students are not as knowledgeable as they used to be , but feels that the wider availability of a university education is not the only reason . He notes that five years ago , graduate school admissions committees would never have asked an applicant if he or she had been abroad . Now , however , many university students and even high-school students have traveled overseas . " This generation of students has had a more diverse array of experiences than the previous .

M . Samuel Noordhoff , a doctor from the United States , had been in Taiwan for decades when he founded the NCF in 1990 , and he began taking teams of Taiwan-trained craniofacial surgery experts to other countries in 1998 . Whereas the most common formula adopted to explain overseas aid is " giving something back to international society , " Rebecca Wang says that it would be more accurate to say that they are driven by " a missionary spirit , " with their religious-based concern for others naturally knowing no national boundaries .

Among all Asian countries Taiwan 's firms are the most active in raising capital . In addition , overseas players are large net investors in the Taiwan stock market .

Many importing countries , strapped by foreign debt , pay particularly close attention to the terms and amount proposed by bidders . In 1979 the ROC government established the Export-Import Bank to assist local makers , granting long-term repayment schedules at low interest rates . In addition , should a foreign customer fail to make good on his payments , the bank will reimburse the Chinese firm and take legal action overseas to recover the debt .  
Because many overseas Chinese have resided abroad for an extended period and may not be familiar with the laws and regulations governing fixed assets , the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has established the Hong Kong Chinese Relocation Bureau to facilitate and ensure the security of housing purchases .

It 's due to our special circumstances , " says Liu Chih-cheng , a landscape designer who has hiked through many national parks in other countries . He points out that the R . O . C . ' s national parks were set up rather late , after they had already become popular tourist areas , unlike many parks overseas , which were established in unused " wastelands . "

Another US $ 7 billion or more comes under the " capital account , " which includes part of the hot money that was drawn into the country over the past two or three years by the appreciation of the NT dollar and is now flowing out again . Then there 's immigration and overseas investment by the private sector plus government loans and aid to foreign countries , such as that provided by the International Economic Cooperation Development Fund .  
Chinese based abroad were particularly concerned about China 's poverty at the turn of the century and gave generously in support of Sun Yatsen 's nationalist revolution . Overseas Chinese newspaper proprietors encouraged revolutionary sentiment ; Singapore Chinese Chang Yung-fu lent his home as a meeting place for the Tung Meng Hui , and Sun Yatsen stayed there when he visited Singapore ; Vietnam-based overseas Chinese bought ammunition to assist nationalist forces at the Battle of Huanghuakang in the year 1911 , and in that battle some dozen of them gave their lives for the revolutionary cause .  
Trade and business contacts , academic scholarly exchange , events sponsored by private groups , and overseas tourism by ordinary citizens are all channels for showing people overseas the good side of our people and for demonstrating the united effort being made inside and outside government . This is how a good international image is built up .  
Currently , the editors at Sinorama have set their three main directions as " the domestic pulse , " " traditional culture , " and " overseas reports , " in order to serve as a link for the aspirations of Chinese home and abroad and to truly become a comprehensive and international publication which " has its footing in Taiwan , is concerned about the mainland , and has its eyes open to the world . "  
From the anxious youth of Lou Ti , to the love of home and country of the overseas student of Women ti Ke , the broken dream of returning home in Fei-ts'ui Chieh-chih , up to the coming together of China and the West in the period of the Boxer Rebellion , Chao Shu-hsia has written down the heavy burden of her own heart while also speaking out about the sorrow and suffering of the overseas Chinese .  
Their letter was earnest . The gist of it was that they felt close to the characters in my books and very much wanted to talk with me . . . . There was only a scattering of overseas Chinese in Europe 27 or 28 years ago , and the term " overseas Chinese community " was practically unheard of . As few as we were , under the shadow of the political climate of the time , we fell into two clearly defined camps , the line crossed only by a handful .  
Despite his special fondness for the garden , he actually spent more of his time away from home involved with exhibitions and such during his 20 years there ( from 1953 to 1973 , when he immigrated to the United States ) - - except for a time after France established diplomatic relations with Communist China ( his main overseas market was Europe ) , when he stayed holed up at home and did n't care to travel about much .  
But overseas surveys have shown baldness is spreading " up top " in highly civilized countries among high-density urban populations and overstressed workers . It 's more and more common for people talented and handsome in their youth to be struck by baldness with the onset of middle age , and growing numbers of people are worried about hair loss once they turn 25 .  
Wu Kuang-ting , for many years secretary of overseas Chinese affairs at the ROC embassy , explains : " There are three such chief justices in Panama , each nominated by the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government respectively . Because they are responsible for overseeing the elections they must enjoy impeccable reputations . That Luis Chen was the nomination of the executive branch shows how highly he was regarded by the former government . "  
It 's not like a lot of magazines that just skim over things superficially and after you 're done you ca n't remember a word you 've read . That two seasoned reporters spent three hours of their time interviewing for an article of something over l , 000 words with two photographs shows admirable dedication . Competition overseas must be intense , and it 's not easy for a magazine to be held in esteem both at home and abroad .  
According to Council for Economic Planning and Development member Wu Chia-hsing , the main reason for Korea going into the red has been fulfilment of the government 's election pledges . With the construction of two million houses in the public sector domestic demand has diverted glass , concrete and steel from exports and even led to their being imported from overseas .  
Some grown-up " overseas students , " who have fulfilled their military obligations or finished junior college in Taiwan , have organized a club for them called the Chinese Youth Association . Besides holding lots of outdoor activities to let them work off steam so they can fall asleep as soon as their head touches the pillow when they get home , the older members help the students with their homework or find doctors or lawyers for them in case of emergencies . "  
Do n't Let the Orchids Wither : Given the current world situation , we do n't have a lot of support from other countries in returning to the U . N . right now , as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found out by inquiring through its agencies overseas . On the other hand , regional and economic international organizations have been growing more and more important since the end of the Cold War .  
As for the R . O . C . , which has deep ties with both Berkeley and Dr . Tien - - he graduated from Kien Kuo senior high school and National Taiwan University before going to the U . S . and Berkeley boasts more members of Academia Sinica than any other university overseas - - the Ministry of Education , the Legislative Yuan and the private sector have donated US $ 3 million since his appointment was announced in support of its research on East Asia and other broad academic areas . "  
The formal features of overseas Chinese buildings in Malaysia come from southern Fukien , reflecting the deep historical ties that the local immigrants have with China proper .  
However , the ownership of the publishing rights overseas is rather complex . Sometimes the rights belong to the writer , sometimes to the publishing house , and sometimes to an agent . " If you 're not familiar with the terrain , for publishers without any experience negotiating international publishing rights , it is very easy to look in the wrong places for partners , " says Luc Kwanten , executive vice president of the Big Apple Tuttle-Mori Agency , which has been operating for five years .  
" The system of agents has long been in place abroad , and is the long-term trend , " explains Luc Kwanten . For people overseas who have the publishing rights , dealing with a single agent saves a great deal of trouble over negotiating with individual publishers whose operating situations are unclear . For the domestic publishing industry , going through an agency saves even more in expenses than setting up your own publishing rights department or hiring specially trained negotiators . "  
Ten years ago , to help children that have been unable to receive proper parental care because their families have suffered special problems or misfortunes , the R . O . C . Children 's Welfare Foundation studied examples overseas and introduced to Taiwan the foster care system , in which families volunteer to take in foster children on a temporary basis .  
It would be nice if Chinese living overseas could share more of what they have learned with each other , especially French cuisine , which is world famous - - I expect that French cooking is more attractive than jus cheese and salads . As for oysters , judging from my many years of experience work ing in a hospital , it 's best to eat them cooked instead of raw .  
Complementary factors home and abroad : Although the scale and professionalism of overseas markets are key factors in enticing animators to go abroad to develop , if you look carefully at this trend , the larger domestic and external environments are also complementary . "  
For me and many other overseas Chinese living here , Taipei is such a distant place that it 's hard to sense what it must be like , how it 's changed from quiet and tranquility to bustling crowds and prosperity . Life here is a matter of constantly doing our utmost to realize ourselves and raise our oppressed status . It 's just like that passage in " Chinese ?  
I 'm sure the reason many overseas students go bad or give up on themselves is that they 're afraid of being unable to live up to their parents ' expectations , combined with the stress of living overseas and the pressure of getting ahead academically .  
Those days of Williamsport and the " Triple Crown " surely give us some warm memories : the whole family up in front of the TV in the wee hours of the morning to cheer on the team overseas , watching the children coming through the screen from the other side of the world winning the title " world champions " even as those in Taiwan were straining away to get the economy to take off and the country was meeting diplomatic setbacks in the 1970s - - what adult was n't moved to tears ?  
Associate professor Chung Wei-wen of National Chengchi University 's Graduate School of Journalism agrees with this judgement . Yet he still wants to wake up potential overseas students to the fact that knowledge is not a passive thing . When you go abroad , you can see the environment in all its pluralism and complexity , but if you do not have the ability to make acute observations and just hold on to your fixed frame of thinking , then it is like returning empty handed from a mountain of treasures .  
Cheng Shu-min , manager of program planning at Chinese Television System , also says that when you look at examples from overseas , audiences tend to identify with their native culture and we have yet to see terrestrial television stations closing down due to competition from satellite . Yet the rise of new electronic media technology has still made the networks aware of a change in the domestic market , a change which has seen a breaking up of the tripartite world of the three television channels and a movement towards audience fragmentation . "  
For this reason the many arguments expounded in Novel China are mainly presented through analogy and dialogue between large numbers of works , and concentrate on probing the emergence , development and current state of several genre traditions within recent and modern Chinese fiction , including political , local-flavor , overseas student life , science fiction , erotic , feminine consciousness , and others , along with these genres ' aesthetic , social , and cultural implications .  
As Legislator Cheng Chien-jen observes , " the fates of the overseas Chinese and the Republic of China have been closely linked since the Revolution , through the founding of the Republic , the Northern Expedition , the War of Resistance against Japan and the ' Period of Mobilization for Suppressing the Communist Rebellion , ' right up to the present day . " But changing times and the rapid evolution in the domestic and international environment have brought a qualitative and quantitative change in the relationship between Chinese people and their motherland .  
At the end of the Ching dynasty , with the failure of the 100 Days Reform , the reformist royalist protectors Kang Yu-wei and Liang Chi-chao , both Cantonese , fled abroad . They published newspapers and established schools for the overseas Chinese in all kinds of places , stirring up patriotic thinking . It was only then that the Overseas Chinese began to identify with their country and became enthusiastic about politics .  
Japan 's Nik-kei Shinbun carried a report that the foreign exchange reserves of the overseas Chinese of the whole world amount to US $ 300 billion . Britain 's Economist reported that the accrued capital of the Chinese outside mainland China , excluding stock , is US $ 1.5 - - 2 trillion .  
The forgotten people of historyEventually the Japanese came to the view that overseas Chinese organizations posed too serious a threat . Since Kao could not be bought , they played their trump card , forcing him to sell the transit company he ran with relatives . At the same time , the police were assigned to monitor his every move , investigating and questioning anyone he associated with . And so they cut both his access to money and his social network .  
Therefore , despite the fact that most of the people active in his books come from overseas , and his discussion of nativist matters is deeply imbued with western style thought patterns , he establishes a dialectical relationship with his theories ( phenomena ) and readers through his alluring and noble prose , the many levels on which his work can be understood , and his clear and persuasive method of reasoning .  
At that time it was specially stipulated in the land reform law that the houses of overseas Chinese were acquired through their efforts abroad . Except for those houses that were rented out and definitely involved " exploitation " and which had to undergo " national reform , " the government could not confiscate those houses in which the families of overseas Chinese were living or those rented out which did not exceed 150 square meters .  
The policy of actively returning houses has only been going on for the past five years . Many overseas Chinese are scattered abroad , and have only heard about the program in a roundabout fashion before coming to investigate . Also , for example , in 1990 after the PRC established diplomatic relations with Indonesia , a large group of overseas Chinese from there came forward to apply . "  
There has never been a case of a country which establishes a public school in a geographic location belonging to a foreign power . And furthermore Taiwan does not have official diplomatic relations with Indonesia . Chaoalso notes that the overseas schools of America and Japan , although partly subsidized by their respective governments , remain nevertheless private schools . "  
Stories from those days record that those Chinese laborers who risked their very lives to work overseas never failed to mail the money they accumulated back home , to improve the lives of their family . When they had the rare opportunity to return and reunite with their families , inevitably they brought some exotic curiosities , as well as tales of what they had seen and heard in the colorful world abroad , bringing smiles to the faces of loved ones .  
According to Chinese American scholar Him Mark Lai , overseas Chinese , being influenced by American architecture , came back to build a series of structures that combined Western and Chinese influences . Typically , the front half was a blue-gray brick western style building with a flat roof one or two storeys high , while the back half retained the traditional design of an " A " shaped roof composed of fir wood and bricks .  
While overseas he saw many Chinese people in a state of ignorance and superstition , with a low level of cultural cultivation . In his hometown he saw old private schools in a state of decay , and the new Western-style schools corrupt . Many children in the village already over the age of ten were still naked and played in the streets : " It almost returned to a prehistoric state of barbarity .  
Q : After you came back , you devoted yourself to encouraging talented people from Taiwan who now live overseas to return home , and you established the Foundation for Development of Outstanding Fellows . A while back we went to the mainland to conduct interviews and discovered that you are the chairman of the Tan Kah Kee International Institute , which was established in honor of the famous Southeast Asian Chinese who founded Xiamen University .  
As international boundaries become increasingly blurred and the global village becomes a reality , working or living overseas no longer seems unusual . Yet families divided in this way have to confront the risk of dramatic upheaval or even disintegration .  
The broad idea for this was floated two years ago . The hope is that Taiwan can take advantage of its geographic location , orthodox Chinese culture , business connections with overseas Chinese , and solid industrial base to become the regional center for foreign firms coming to the Asian region ( and especially for those firms investing in the PRC ) .  
At any rate , the investment required to open a computer center is not nearly as monumental as a factory or an overseas branch operation . With the use of satellite communications it really was n't that difficult . As far as Hong Kong and Shanghai is concerned , we were simply turning circumstances to our advantage . " Lo reveals that several dozen employees have returned by this method .  
To be fair , the three military drama troupes held many morale-boosting public performances and competitions over the years , which soothed the homesickness of those mainland officers and soldiers who moved to Taiwan early on . They have served overseas to promote Chinese culture , and they have helped prevent the disappearance of the Peking dramatic arts . The problem is that art and the military simply make peculiar bedfellows .  
According to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission , there are currently about 260,000 overseas Chinese eligible to register for the presidential election . This figure was arrived at by starting with the number of people who " formerly had legal residence in Taiwan but then moved abroad , " minus the number of minors ( people below 20 ) and deceased persons . ( The latter two figures were calculated on the basis of the percentage of non-adult persons and the death rate in Taiwan . )  
Benjamin Lu , Taiwan 's representative in the US , was even more optimistic in an estimate he made last December while on a trip back to Taiwan . He guessed that 300,000 people living in the US would vote in the presidential election . ( His guess exceeded the theoretical limit of 260,000 because he also considered the number of ROC citizens in the US who still have legal residence in Taiwan , and thus are not included in the estimate of 260,000 eligible " overseas Chinese . "  
On one occasion , a KMT candidate in the southern part of the island held an outdoor rally , but cold weather kept voters at home . Fortunately the 80-plus strong overseas support group showed up , saving the candidate from a rather embarrassing situation .  
" In future , newspapers should be competing on quality , not price , " says Simon Cheng , observing that compared with major newspapers overseas which cost at least NT $ 30-40 , newspapers in the ROC have always been cheap . When a number of honestly-run newspapers in Hong Kong were forced out of business by cutthroat competition in a price war last year , it was the readers who suffered in the end .  
In recent years , wild animals raised in captivity have been given more living space and more natural surroundings . Still , says Marcus Phipps of TRAFFIC , there are still some extremist animal rights groups overseas who wish to close all zoos and sea-world theme parks , with the goal of returning the animals to their natural habitats .  
Chiang Kuan-feng feels that on this occasion the issuing of invitations was " broad and deep . " Equal attention was given to the central government and the localities ; professional , religious , and social groups were all included ; and even overseas Chinese were given as fair a distribution of RSVPs as possible . As for how many people could or would come , it was hard to say . The only thing to do was keep calling the contact people for each group and ask , " What will your attendance rate be ? "  
While other dancers were abroad studying foreign techniques , she went overseas several times to collect materials - - including hand-written copies of ancient choreographic notation - - on ancient Chinese music and dance . She reconstructed and staged many old works . She also created modern dance based on these materials .  
The communist authorities in mainland China continue to spare no efforts to maintain Mao 's exalted status and to gloss over his monstrous crimes , refusing to rattle at his halo , and even overseas some people are enraptured by Mao 's nationalism and idealism , and blind to his basically treacherous and despotic nature .  
The assistant general manager of Mingtung , a Mr . Chang , points out that overseas Chinese account for only about half of the Western demand . When he went to Europe to lecture about Chinese medicine , many caucasian physical therapists and other medical professionals attended his classes . In Germany and Switzerland some Chinese medicines have already been certified .  
Perhaps a passage by veteran reporter Ku Meng-jen , written as a commentary on Chong Shu 's novel The Chinese People , is particularly apropos : " From the Chinese laborers of the past to the immigrants of today , from the narrow alleys of Chinatown to present-day Silicon Valley , the peregrine steps of the overseas Chinese on the one hand reflect the changes of the times , and on the other hand express the growth of the Chinese people in foreign society .  
In other words , even though the production base moves overseas , the " headquarters " and " logistical support center " remain in Taiwan . Operations items stay in Taiwan , along with capital sourcing , legal , tax , and financial planning , and training of internationalized personnel . All these could service the production bases located in surrounding countries .  
Academia Sinica President Lee Yuan - tseh believes that achievements in scholarship within Taiwan depend to a great extent on cooperative efforts between academics at home and abroad . As the gap with overseas scholarship is closed , the number of Taiwan-resident scholars elected to the Academia Sinica will increase , and more overseas scholars will be willing to return to Taiwan . The most important thing is to make contributions toward academic development in Taiwan , and the only standard of judgment should be the level of academic work .  
Even after you have graduated from university or graduate school , there are still all kinds of career-training buxibans that will help you cross over to a new profession , prepping you for the national civil service exam , TOEFL , overseas university entrance exams , qualifying licensing examinations , and even specialized tests for journalism or the foreign service .  
But it also proved to be a turning point , for " to save the situation , the New Zealand government stepped in and set up the New Zealand Kiwifruit Marketing Board ( NZKMB ) . This replaced the former system of multiple exporters , and introduced a unified approach to the business , with global coordination covering every stage from improved cultivar selection to production , packing , cool storage , transport , shipping , overseas distribution , marketing and promotion , " says NZKMB new project manager Stuart Abbott .  
Meanwhile , the main regulations governing Taiwan 's relations with Hong Kong have been largely completed . July 1997 will not merely be a starting point for Tung and the people of Hong Kong . Taiwanese , mainland Chinese , overseas Chinese , and Asia-watchers everywhere are waiting with bated breath . Tung is indeed bearing an unprecedented historical burden .  
Of ' Mui 's twin sons Huegu ( Chang Hui-kuo ) and ' Api , the one plays guitar to a professional standard , and the other has been described as an excellent singer ever since he was in elementary school . Once he was grown up , ' Api was hired by several tourist " culture villages " in Hualien County as a singing and dancing instructor . He has frequently gone overseas to represent his local area in international aboriginal singing and dancing performances .  
When the floodgates were later opened , the floodwater receded within half-an-hour , leaving behind a thick layer of mud and incalculable damage . Afterwards , as Taipei Mayor Chen Shui-bian was on vacation overseas , Deputy Mayor Lin Chia-cheng made a statement which asserted that human error had been involved in the Tahu flood . Bureau of Public Works Director Hsu Jui-feng has agreed to take the blame for this incident , and Office of City Parks &amp; Street Lights Director Chang Ching , as well as five of his subordinates , have received demerits .  
Through long-term arrangements by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and overseas representative offices , Vice President Lien Chan conducted his second visit to Europe under the low profile of a " holiday " and " private visit . " He made substantive , face-to-face contact with a nation with which the ROC does not have diplomatic ties , and established the critical beginnings of friendship and progressive exchange . The incessant actions of Beijing are additional proof of the barriers which the ROC currently faces in foreign relations .  
" In 1982 Chien Ssu-liang , who was then president of the Academia Sinica , visited the East Coast of the United States and gathered together a group of us overseas members of the Academia Sinica , " Luke Yuan recalls . " He noted that Taiwan was doing pretty well in terms of applied science-using science to advance industrial and commercial development . But in basic research , especially in fields dependent on scientific experiments , Taiwan was quite weak . He asked us for our opinions and advice . "  
In the case of travel , people are not satisfied with what domestic trips have to offer and are going abroad , increasing the amount of money Taiwanese spend on overseas travel . In 1996 , 5.71 million Taiwanese traveled abroad spending a total of US $ 8.15 billion , an amount equal to 46% of what Taiwan earned from trade in that year .  
In later years , although Taiwan had made tremendous progress relative to its situation 25 years before , the difficulties it faced in raising funds overseas were proportional to those it faced in surviving internationally , and this created more problems for the center . Moreover , domestically , the island was entering the democratic era . Most citizens , including the legislators who held the purse-strings , did n't understand the importance of the center and its contribution to the world . Consequently , the budget was cut repeatedly .  
In addition to improving the quality and quantity of vegetable production , its efforts allowed young soybeans to become a major agricultural export for Taiwan , which improved farmers ' incomes and earned foreign exchange for the country . Chou says that the center has also , over the years , nurtured a large pool of skilled personnel from both overseas and Taiwan .  
Just our bad luck to be born at the wrong time ! " But what does fill them with rage and disgust is " intentional bankruptcies " - - when unscrupulous bosses , under the pretense that business is bad , allow factories to go broke , while in secret they have long since arranged to move production overseas or to transfer assets out of the company . Some even close down the existing company and start up under another name to avoid having to pay workers ' retirement bonuses .  
He reminisces , thinking back to some of the measures that led to Taiwan 's current level of development . All of these policies , whether the all-out effort to develop the local IC industry , the establishment of the " one-stop shopping " science-based industrial parks , the importation of the concept of venture capitalism or the incentives to high-tech investment that the government provided , were hammered out in discussions between government strategists and Chinese who had studied and worked overseas .  
Liu Tseng-kui , a research associate at the Academia Sinica 's Institute of History and Philology , created History Links ' basic structure out of his personal collection of website bookmarks , accumulated over years of combing overseas websites for historical data for his research . In the course of his research , Liu discovered that while there was no dearth of literary and historical websites in Taiwan , there were few online collections of links to such sites . He therefore assembled his own site last year , dividing his vast collection of bookmarks into categories .  
In 1994 and 1995 , the question of whether Japan should take on a greater military role in Asia stirred intense controversy in many Asian countries . At that time , Lee Kwan Yew stated in no uncertain terms to American and Japanese news media that he was opposed to a stronger overseas role for the Japanese military . In stating his opposition , he told of his own terrifying experiences during the Japanese occupation of Singapore , and even spoke of a dark side to Japanese culture .  
During Premier Siew 's visit to Belize however , many overseas Chinese reported threats to their personal safety and property , or discrimination when passing through immigration . Premier Siew reported this to Prime Minister Musa , and instructed the ROC embassy to take care of local overseas Chinese . At the same time he emphasized that all embassies and consulates should give equal treatment to Chinese from the mainland in those countries with diplomatic ties to the ROC .  
The program proved extremely popular and was aired for a full two years . Many of the documentary films used were collected by John Hei on trips overseas , and sometimes the ROC military even borrowed such material for information purposes .  
MIOD president Robert Chen says that in recent years the RMI has made developing the fishing industry one of the main planks of its economic development strategy , and to foster overseas investment it is encouraging international joint ventures .  
This approach of marrying outside capital and technology with the rich local marine resources is one of the more feasible models by which the Taiwanese fishing industry , faced with limited opportunities at home , can develop overseas operations . The RMI , which has just established diplomatic relations with the ROC , is an ideal place for such investment .  
In the 1980s , in a China undergoing reform and liberalization and stressing intellectual liberation and the May Fourth spirit of enlightenment , eminent mainland scholar Wang Yuanhua responded to an overseas scholars ' assertion that the radical thinking of May Fourth Movement figures was expressed in " all-round rejection of tradition " with the following words : " What the May Fourth Movement was up against was a feudalism which had been the ruling ideology for thousands of years . . . . Hence to rebel against it required a much greater effort . "  
Thanks to this explanation and analysis , readers can understand everything from the works of Shakespeare to the lives of Taiwan 's aborigines , from the views of the Dalai Lama , to those of the overseas Chinese singing star Lee-hom Wang . There is international news and also domestic news . Some of it 's serious , and some of it 's trendy . These English-instruction magazines attest to the fact that Taiwanese appetites for information are getting larger and increasingly varied !  
But as Hsueh Cheng-tai points out , when you consider the daily routine of most foreign workers and how little free time it leaves them for breaking the law , and bear in mind that the crime rate among illegal foreign workers is far higher than for the legal ones , the problem does indeed merit attention . Especially given that in 1997 rape accounted for the largest share of serious crime committed by overseas workers , causing widespread anxiety among the public .  
Assistance also comes from locals who have long been active in the labor and human rights movements , such as Yvonne Lin , who for nearly ten years has helped foreign laborers stuck in detention centers to get back to their home countries . Lin says that caring for the lives of working people is a cause that transcends nationality , and that disputes between overseas workers and their employers often simply highlight problems already faced by Taiwanese workers . Tackling such problems can help to pave the way for improved rights all round .  
But Taiwanese companies are inexperienced in this area , and sending products overseas for quality certification tests is time consuming and complicated , so local companies can only stand and watch as the entire market goes to imported products .  
Nevertheless , it was hard to resist . Souls locked up for the decade of the Cultural Revolution had lost interest in so-called revolutionary songs that " put politics in command . " Some mainland Chinese with overseas connections brought Teresa Teng 's music into the PRC . Her delicate and warm voice radiated feelings of intimacy , love , and nostalgia , touching the natural feelings that had been suppressed for so long .  
In autobiographical notes which Liu wrote a few years ago for the benefit of his many local and overseas visitors , he outlined his career prior to founding Biographical Literature : " Liu Shao-tang ( original name Liu Tsung-hsiang ) ; ancestral home Lutai , Hebei Province ; born in Jin County , Liaoning Province , on the 14th day of the ninth lunar month , 1921 .  
Taking as a precedent his approach to the Mass Rapid Transit System when he was mayor of Taipei , Chen says that during the mayoral elections he opposed the embryonic mass transit system , but he did not tear it down just to fulfill a campaign promise . Instead , he organized a group of experts from Taiwan and overseas to investigate the system , and , he says , resolved the problems by improving the MRTS .  
Few people are aware that in many Chinese restaurants overseas , almost every item of decor , from the paneled ceilings and intricately carved wooden ornamental windows to the floral-medallion-pattern carpet and the lions outside the door , is the work of Taiwan 's China Palace Art and Painting Company , owned and managed by the Sung family , and that most of these items were handmade in Taiwan before being shipped out by the container load .  
To a Chinese , all these things seem vaguely familiar , yet also bizarre and alien . Today , as the world grows ever smaller , the Chinese style expressed overseas still has an element of the romance of a declining empire . But the appearance of today 's Chinese palaces is no longer so phantasmagorical , and they are no longer reserved for the sole enjoyment of royalty and rich folk .  
Perhaps the most interesting part of this temple is to the right of the main hall . The space there contains more than 8000 ancestral tablets for the deceased . This was a space built by the Chinese gold workers and business people of those bygone days as their resting place for the afterlife . It is the largest extant collection of memorial tablets in any overseas Chinese society in Asia .  
NGOs overseas have pressured their governments to adopt certain restrictions . Moreover , scientists opposed to genetic engineering frequently air their views , and this soul-searching within the scientific community has placed certain " in-house " checks upon the direction of development . " There has been almost no public debate at all in Taiwan on this subject , " says Lin , who laments the low level of concern in Taiwan over genetic science and its applications .  
In this way , the western part of the Southeast Asian littoral came within China 's sphere of influence . Furthermore , there were great profits to be had . Each expedition set out laden with silk and porcelain , to be exchanged for rare and precious commodities from overseas , and this too helps to explain why Zheng set sail on seven separate voyages .  
" National sovereignty " is reflected in a country 's ability to engage in diplomatic relations , but in this most critical area for national survival , Taiwan has long been suffering from PRC efforts to undercut Taiwan 's international status . Indeed , as Levi C . Ying , an overseas Chinese legislator from the New Party , says , mainland China is the only real obstacle and enemy to Taiwan 's foreign relations .  
As Lo says , " The ROC must move in the direction of flexible diplomacy and utilize foreign policy resources more flexibly . " In the future , overseas offices of the ROC will undertake functional integration at the continental level , with different locations having different specialties , such as overseas Chinese affairs , political affairs , and media relations . All the offices in a particular region will be linked into a single , more efficient , and more richly endowed cooperative group .  
Q : Taiwan firms have always been cooperative , and overseas investment has been very helpful to the ROC 's diplomatic work . But today the government is putting political considerations first in encouraging Taiwan firms to invest in friendly countries . From an economic point of view , how effective is this ?  
A : Of all the wealthy and powerful countries in the world today , there is not one that does not employ overseas investment to maximize the efficiency of factors of production and to develop overseas markets . In so doing , they achieve the dual goals of improving the domestic industrial structure and raising their international economic position .  
In the early 1980s his book A Preliminary Discussion of the Art of Modern Fiction made him a celebrity in Beijing cultural circles , and was known as one of the " four beautiful kites launched into China 's broad , lonely skies . " But because the ideas in the book went against the officially promoted doctrine of social realism , and tended towards Western modernism , Gao 's work was suppressed by the communist authorities and he went into exile overseas .  
However , Columbia University professor and literary critic Wang Dewei feels that Gao Xingjian is a highly innovative writer with original ideas , and that a combination of factors including his fame overseas , his literary status , his creative style and his accessibility surely make him a fitting choice to receive the prize , whether on behalf of Chinese authors or of writers in exile .  
Nonetheless , compared with other Asian countries , Taiwanese people 's sense of their own good fortune is subdued . Recently the media have frequently pinpointed rising " discomfort indicators , " focusing on unemployment , the departure of industry overseas , falling stock prices and an adverse economic outlook , so that people are dogged by anxieties .  
Wu admits that university students are not as knowledgeable as they used to be , but feels that the wider availability of a university education is not the only reason . He notes that five years ago , graduate school admissions committees would never have asked an applicant if he or she had been abroad . Now , however , many university students and even high-school students have traveled overseas . " This generation of students has had a more diverse array of experiences than the previous .  
For the industry panel , the most important points included : Technical personnel from mainland China or overseas can get five-year residence visas or unlimited multiple entry visas ; limitations on company debt and capital borrowing will be relaxed ; foreign subsidiary companies that meet certain conditions can offer employee stock options .  
Joining the WTO may be an inevitable trend , but at a time when all countries are eager to conquer new territories overseas and put up a protective umbrella for their weaker domestic industries , perhaps Taiwan too should be giving more balanced attention to the future of different sectors of society .  
I was still somewhat ambivalent about the whole affair , for I had n't any idea of what it meant to be a volunteer overseas . Later on I received notification to go to Taipei for language and aptitude tests . After passing the first round of tests , I was then notified about oral examinations . The oral exams were divided into three segments : a specific exam , a language exam , and an interview with ICDF staff members .  
Liao Ching-pi , an associate professor of social work at Soochow University and director of the Yoyuen Social Work Foundation , holds strongly to the newer view . Studies done overseas , says Liao , " show that affairs are most likely to happen with men who are unsuccessful in their careers , suffering from sexual dysfunction , or faced with problems in their family or personal relationships that they ca n't handle . "  
Today , it 's nothing special to have the chance to go overseas to study , and a more diversified value system has overturned the previous tradition of invariably studying in the US . The opening up of travel for the purpose of tourism has also allowed many people from different social strata to have the ability to experience foreign cultures .  
The mid-1990s saw a crisis in the local paint industry as production costs increased in Taiwan . Most traditional paint factories closed or moved overseas , while those that remained were forced to make layoffs or cut back salaries .  
The applications for refined CHM can be extended considerably . Already a number of manufacturers in Taiwan are adding raw materials from Kingstone to all kinds of products , including yogurt and ice cream . These raw materials can also be put to use in natural colorings and flavorings , edible fibers , cosmetic masks , bandages , and more . These uses are already common overseas , with the production value of such products increasing year in and year out , but in Taiwan there is still vast room for R &amp; D and promotion .  
It is only by recognizing such limits that we can really talk about the true meaning of freedom . In fact many people know very well what 's what . To paraphrase a doctor who participates in the volunteer overseas medical services provided by the Noordhoff Craniofacial Foundation , no amount of material goods can bring the happiness felt upon seeing the smile of a happy patient .  
They include the medical teams of the International Cooperation and Development Fund , young men doing " overseas duty " as a substitute for military service , religious organizations , and individual doctors . They are performing a wide range of medical assistance activities not just limited to simple humanitarian aid , including donation of medical supplies , technical exchange in the field of public health , education and training , promotion of preventive medicine against epidemic illnesses , and " matchmaking " between people with certain medical needs and those who can provide what is needed .  
The ICDF is a foundation established by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to offer technical assistance , investment , and loans to foreign countries . It is famous worldwide for its agricultural aid teams , but its overseas medical teams also have a long history .  
M . Samuel Noordhoff , a doctor from the United States , had been in Taiwan for decades when he founded the NCF in 1990 , and he began taking teams of Taiwan-trained craniofacial surgery experts to other countries in 1998 . Whereas the most common formula adopted to explain overseas aid is " giving something back to international society , " Rebecca Wang says that it would be more accurate to say that they are driven by " a missionary spirit , " with their religious-based concern for others naturally knowing no national boundaries .  
Full of enthusiasm for this plan , Hsien Wen-chu specially returned to Taiwan to visit NCF executive director Rebecca Wang , but the response he received was a disheartening one . Wang said that because at the time there was an intense public debate going in Taiwan about the need for charities to use funds for the purpose for which they had been donated , and donors to the NCF had not explicitly stated that their donations were to be used for overseas assistance , the foundation had to be cautious in how it used its funds .  
" Currently , only 35 people a year are allowed to perform foreign medical service in lieu of military service , " Kay notes . " This is too small a number , and those performing this service should n't be limited to males of enlistment age . " Having grown up amid affluence , young Taiwanese often have a utilitarian bias . By performing overseas service , they can learn that " those who give always get more in return . "  
Mrs . Lin originally planned to have Chia-hsun complete her undergraduate studies in Taiwan before going on to do advanced studies overseas . " But now , with education policies chopping and changing , I 'm worried that she will lose her international competitiveness , so perhaps we 'll send her to study overseas earlier , " says Mrs . Lin .  
Originally established 45 years ago as a tourism-development taskforce , these days the TAT operates 17 overseas offices and has an annual budget of THB3 to 3.5 billion . Thailand 's numbers of both domestic and foreign tourists have been growing steadily for years , and we expect the number of visitors to top the 10-million mark next year .  
An editorial in the Economic Daily News points out that as stock markets slowly recover around the world , Taiwanese enterprises have actively set their sights on European and US markets , and are issuing depository receipts , global convertible bonds , and using other methods to raise capital . A number of recent overseas offerings by Taiwanese companies have attracted the close attention of international investors .  
The amount of capital raised in international markets by Taiwan 's public companies has already exceeded US $ 7.2 billion . Among all Asian countries Taiwan 's firms are the most active in raising capital . In addition , overseas players are large net investors in the Taiwan stock market . This is due in part to growing optimism as the world 's stock markets emerge from the shadow of three bad years , and in part to the fact that foreign investors are looking positively at the prospects of Taiwan 's economy .  
In 1989 , the company 's art editor brought back books of paper sculptures from an overseas trip . At the time , this form of artistic expression was relatively unknown in Taiwan , but Wu Ching-fang found the beautiful paper sculpture works on each page of the book strangely attractive and was especially fascinated by a Japanese book on paper cutting by Noda Ajin . These works clearly differed from Western pieces , tending to be more adult in orientation .  
Editor 's Note : As the economy in Taiwan has improved and a more international view of the world taken hold , an increasing number of people have expressed a willingness to serve overseas as volunteers . The author of this article , development volunteer Sam Lai , decided to write down his experiences in the mountainous area along the Thai-Myanmar border and we thank him for his moving story .  
Architecture has long been a most regrettable , unbecoming shortcoming of the " beautiful island " of Taiwan . Shop signs sticking out all over the place , iron window grates plastered all over buildings , and shacks willy-nilly sprouting on rooftops-an architectural crazy quilt more post-modern than post-modern , in " immigrant makeshift " style . People from overseas have a difficult time describing Taiwan cities as " beautiful . " The best they can manage is " unusual . "  
Last year , after staff from the Formosa Plastics Group on an overseas inspection tour learned of this mechanism , the company decided to assist Vietnam in developing clean technologies such as cogeneration ( combined heat and power ) and tree planting , and then sell the resulting greenhouse gas reduction credits ( valued at US $ 10 per tonne ) to countries that need them , thus developing a new line of business .  
After prices had risen , the number of fish farmers raising tilapia increased . And with a continual stream of orders from abroad , the tilapia industry entered a boom period . Fish fillets were sterilized with ozone and then frozen with liquid nitrogen to preserve freshness and texture , then shipped overseas . " That was the golden age for tilapia , " reminisces Yang Shu-fen , a Chiayi resident whose family has run fish processing plants for two generations .  
In order to maintain this environment while also developing the level of the more academic courses we provide , we 've decided that the best choice is to follow the example set by overseas adult education providers and adopt a " twin-track " system .  
Fortunately , both Kinmen and Matsu undeniably possess rich tourism assets . Kinmen offers an aggregation of overseas emigrant culture , historic front-line military sights , and Southern Fujianese culture . Matsu , on the other hand , has intact communities of Eastern Fujianese style architecture and a rare species of tern . The larger question , though , is where and how do Kinmen and Matsu best fit in ?  
Then the Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park came along some years later , attracting domestic and overseas tenants with its autonomous management , customs-bonded operations , and " deep processing " ( i.e . processing that yields a significant level of value-added content ) . This was the key to Taiwan 's successful transition to a new type of industry .  
Though going through the worst wave of overseas relocations by local industry in history and facing increasingly bitter competition in industrial development , this year , thanks to a turn for the better in the international economy , Taiwan 's economic performance has stabilized .  
The business elite are in the view that China is more and more attractive to overseas investors because it has maintained political stability and rapid economic growth for years and has great market potential  
He said that the central government has always attached importance to the role of overseas Chinese , who are patriotic and have deep feelings for the motherland They have played a special role in pushing forward the motherland 's economic development , supporting the disaster relief work and promoting the reunification of the motherland  
rong said that in tandem with the development of the enterprises ' joint stock transformation , a major part of china 's efforts to establish the socialist market economic system , more and more chinese enterprises will be listed on overseas bourses  
the province has approved three projects which got loans from foreign governments , ten overseas funded enterprises , and seven projects aided by united nations departments and foreign governments the value of the projects total 25-4-million U S dollars drawn from overseas sources  
the opening momentum has attracted increasing numbers of foreign investors last year , jiangsu approved more than 8,000 foreign investment projects , for which pledged overseas capital reached close to 8 billion us dollars  
to my greatest delight , an increasing number of chinese scholars are going overseas for academic meetings in recent years , many young scholars have been invited to attend and address international conferences no wonder professor t d lee , a nobel prize winner , said that chinese will have a bigger say on physics in the 21st century  
United States government civilian employees assigned overseas may receive a taxable post differential of up to 25 per cent of basic salary for posting to duty stations where " extraordinarily difficult or notably unhealthful conditions or excessive physical hardships " exist .  
It is the invalidation by the United States side of the key provisions of the Armistice Agreement that has paved the way for south Korea 's current status as the greatest United States overseas military base and nuclear base .  
The representative of the Republic of Korea identified the following crucial components of the East Asian development experience : political and economic stability , which could only be fully ensured by sound domestic governance ; an export orientation with export promotion ; capital accumulation financed both domestically and from abroad ; the upgrading and importation of new technology and the development of overseas marketing skills ; balanced enterprise development ; and human resource development , at the level of both skilled workers and advanced education .  
The Cook Islands pointed out that although organized transnational crime had not yet appeared within its territory , law enforcement authorities continued to be informed of developments overseas and had suggested to the relevant political authorities that they consider promulgating legislation to prevent and control organized transnational crime and that they also strengthen international cooperation in the field by acceding to relevant conventions and instruments .  
The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung elucidated in an all-round way the questions on the founding of the DCRK , including the problem of forming a supreme national confederal assembly with an equal number of representatives from the north and the south and an appropriate number of representatives of overseas nationals under which a confederal standing committee is organized to discuss and decide on common issues related to the overall interests of the country and nation . 
Upon the initiative of the respected leader , a proposal was made in August 1981 to hold a Conference for the Promotion of National Reunification , with the participation of the representatives of the political parties and organizations from the north , the south and the overseas compatriots and to convene a joint conference in February 1982 to be attended by 100 persons , including politicians from the north , the south and overseas .  
All parties to the contract of employment of migrant workers must declare the real terms and conditions with respect to the workers employment . 27 This Member State has also established a watch list or blacklist of foreign principals and employers who are prohibited , because of default in contractual obligations or grave misconduct , from participating in the overseas employment programme . 
Compared with exporters from developed countries , who can have easy access to specialized trade-finance facilities , exporters from developing countries , particularly exporters of non-traditional goods , are disadvantaged as they usually can not offer long-term credits to overseas buyers or obtain at an affordable cost insurance coverage against the commercial and political risks involved for such exports .  
It has never engaged in overseas aggression , nor does it have any intention of using landmines in other countries .  Should China use anti-personnel landmines in legitimate circumstances , it would be entirely for the purpose of defending against foreign military intervention and aggression , safeguarding its national unification and territorial integrity , and ensuring a peaceful life for its own people .  
The Committee urged the Government of the Philippines to adopt a top-priority policy of creating safe and protected jobs for women as a viable economic alternative to the current unemployment of women and their participation as subcontractors and in the informal sector , as workers in free trade zones or as in commercial sex , or as migrant overseas contract workers .  
The Committee urged the Government of the Philippines to adopt a top-priority policy of creating safe and protected jobs for women as a viable economic alternative to the current unemployment of women and their participation as subcontractors and , in the informal sector , as workers in free-trade zones , as prostitutes or as overseas contract workers .  
Despite the surfeit of pious excuses that has been found to justify ethically the launching of this overseas colonial enterprise , and the pseudo _ juridical ( sometimes even openly anti-juridical ) reasoning which has attempted to defend it legally , there is irrefutable evidence that its clearly _ defined goals had nothing either humanitarian or civilizing about them .  
As far as issues recognized in the 1988 outline as elements to be addressed at the end of the study are concerned , the Special Rapporteur identified the role of treaties in European expansion overseas ( addressed in chapter III above ) ; the contemporary significance of treaties , agreements , and other constructive arrangements , including questions relating to State succession , national recognition of such instruments , and the views held by indigenous peoples on them .  
My own country of Saint Lucia , and our Eastern Caribbean sister State of Dominica , share special cultural , economic and social ties with the overseas departments of Guadeloupe , Martinique and French Guyana , which represents the political model of integrated status and whose representatives have been present with us here at this Seminar to discuss the intricacies of that political status .  
The developing countries , for their part , were dependent on limited overseas markets and exports and were at the mercy of the international financial institutions ; they suffered the negative consequences of globalization but had virtually no role in defining the rules of the game , and their repeated calls for democratic governance of the global economy had fallen on deaf ears .  
With fresh confidence and courage , the entire Korean people in the north , the south and overseas will spur the national reunification movement and build a reunified , prosperous and powerful State in the near future .  
The gross contribution of tourism to national income is diminished by primary leakages of foreign exchange earnings arising from imports of materials and equipment for construction , imports of consumer goods ( including food and drink ) , repatriation of profits earned by foreign investors , overseas promotional expenditures and amortization of external debt incurred in the development of hotels and resorts .  
An integrated , collaborative and coordinated approach to facilities policy , administrative and budgetary information exchange is being formulated to promote effective and efficient planning , management , maintenance and operation for all Headquarters and overseas physical facilities of the Organization .
