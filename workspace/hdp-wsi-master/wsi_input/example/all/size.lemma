For the past two years , facts have proved that the implementation of the proactive policy has achieved remarkable success .  Despite an increase in both the fiscal deficit and the size of debts , the implementation of the proactive policy has safeguarded social stability , maintained sustained rapid and healthy national economic growth , and raised the living standard .  
On the other hand , Xiang Huaicheng added , the state has attached great importance to the issues of national debt and the size of the deficit ; strengthened fiscal capacity and the study of public risks ; strictly monitored the trend of fiscal operation ; prepared the necessary measures ; paid attention to precautions against fiscal risks ; reduced unnecessary expenses ; strove to control the size of the deficit ; improved policy means ; and enhanced the guiding and stimulating role of financial capital .  
If China 's large enterprises will really compete with multinational enterprise groups in the international markets , they must further resolve the problem of irrational enterprise structure and , in light of the law governing the market economy , form a more reasonable economy of scale as quickly as possible through merger , association , and reorganization .  Enterprises should be large in size , but more importantly they should be powerful in strength .  
Enterprises should be helped to solve their conspicuous problems featured by the huge size of staff , large number of debts , onerous social burdens as soon as possible so that they are able to go into battle with a light pack and participate in competition on an equal footing .  
At the turn of the century , the party Central Committee put forward the strategy of extensively developing the western areas .  This is a major policy decision made by the party 's leadership collective of the third generation who look far ahead from a high plane , take the overall situation into account , judge the hour and size up the situation , and serve the new century .  
In the military reform conducted in Russia in the past few years , the size of various arms and services has been cut by a big margin , but the strategic missile troops alone have been strengthened and they have absorbed the military aerospace troops and the missile space defense troops .  Russia 's strength for launching nuclear attacks and for reconnaissance , early warning and resistance have been strengthened .  
Starting last year , we implemented drastic reforms in such overall areas of the enterprises as management models , mechanisms for motion , and management scope .  We greatly increased overall planning and policy , liquidation and investment , capital management , organized marketing , science and technology research and development for customer service and handling of public relations , and basically realized transformation from a State administered company to large size enterprise group .  
As all types of economic targets are large in number and wide in scope ; are interrelated with one another ; and are under the control of different departments , some of which are also large in size ; are exposed to a large extent ; and are highly vulnerable owing to their state of production , operation , or utilization in peace time , it is difficult and costly to protect them .  Also it is unrealistic to protect them in an all-round way and hard to raise their protection efficiency .  
The new international political and economic order should be based on commonly-recognized standards of international relations , be suited to the development and progress needs of the age , and reflect the spirit of peace and equality , with all countries being equal regardless of their relative size , wealth , or strength .  
Regarding the major question of how to treat the productive forces and production relations in socialist society , we committed two mistakes : 1 ) we believed that , for the socialist ownership system , the larger the size and the higher the degree of public ownership the better ; and 2 ) over a long time , we did not attach first priority to developing the productive forces .  
Our comprehensive national capability is now of a substantial size .  Our gross domestic product is expected to reach 8,600-billion yuan for 2000 , with the overall economic volume being the seventh largest in the world ; foreign exchange reserves total over $ 160-billion ;  
The General Staff Headquarters made a decision a few days ago on setting up coordination centers for protecting the legitimate rights and interests of military units , servicemen and servicemen 's family members in provincial capitals where there are many military units under the General Staff Headquarters on condition that the authorized size of the armed forces is not expanded .  
In order to consolidate the good momentum of a turnaround in the economy this year and comprehensively size up the situation , China will continue to practice an active fiscal policy : First , we will issue 150-billion yuan worth of long-term construction bonds , with the focus on investment in sectors with the nature of " public items " such as infrastructure , environmental protection , and science and education ; we will increase effective domestic demand and also promote economic restructuring , innovation in science and technology , and sustainable development .  
In the Indian Ocean region , India is rather powerful in terms of territorial size , population , scientific and technological capability , military and economic strength .  India also has certain influential power in the international political arena .  Therefore , drawing India to its side and playing the " Indian card " will bring a lot of benefits for the United States to seize the world hegemony .  
Third , we should tighten the efforts in compiling the needed teaching materials , and work as quickly as possible to come up with well-compiled teaching materials suitable for different types of cadres to study .  We should make earnest efforts to address the existing problems found in our teaching materials - - such problems as they are not systematic or relevant , and they have only " one size that fits all . "  We should tighten centralized planning and set up a scientific and rational system of compiling teaching materials for the training of cadres .  
These enterprises have formulated a complete set of strict systems and enterprise standards centering on product quality .  They implement efficient control on the entire process of product purchases , warehousing , distribution , and retailing , thereby ensuring product quality and blocking fake and inferior quality products from entering the market at their sources .  They have won the appreciation and trust of the vast number of consumers , and continued to expand their enterprise size and scope , reaping good economic and social benefits .  
China and Malta are situated far from each other , and they are different in terms of national situation , size , population , and historical background .  However , their relations over the nearly 30 years after they established diplomatic ties can be held up as an example of equal treatment , mutual respect , and peaceful coexistence between a big country and a small nation .  
Viewing from the United States ' perspective , high ranking US officials have generally recognized that in the Indian Ocean region - - no matter whether it is considered from the angle of territorial size , population and resources , scientific and technological capabilities , or military and economic strength - - India fully deserves to be considered as one of the top great nations , and it also possesses influence in the international political arena that can not be ignored .  
China has few civil aircraft , which are of a low utilization rate .  4 .  China 's general aviation ( meaning aerial photography , remote measurement , mineral prospecting , petroleum services , rainmaking , aerial forest protection , afforestation by aerial sowing , agricultural and pastoral sowing , and aerial chemicals spraying in agriculture and forestry ) market is extremely small in size and in a state of contraction .

In Fuyang City where township finance is mainly dependent on taxes and fees levied on peasants , the tax and fee reform reduced the county 's fiscal supply capability by a half .  Under the fiscal pressure , the townships had no way out , but could only resort to cutting personnel , operations , spending , and bureaucracy and have worked to establish rigid mechanisms constraining the size of government .  
To consolidate its sector dealing with Taiwan affairs in light of the new situation , the CPC is about to institute a major reshuffle of the relevant mechanism , including increasing the military 's involvement in Taiwan affairs as well as the number of Taiwan affairs offices nationwide , especially the size of such offices in coastal areas . 
Regarding achievements in science research that are technologically ripe , have broad market prospects , and produce good economic results , the government should coordinate with relevant departments and concentrate efforts on speeding up their transformation and industrialization .  The government should also help science and technology enterprises and scientific research institutions that are changing their system grow in size and strength .  
In China , the small and medium size enterprises are the important components of the country 's economic structure .  The proportion of small and medium-size enterprises accounts for over 99 percent of the industry as a whole .  With staff members accounting for around 80 percent of the total , their industrial output value accounts for over 60 percent and foreign trade and exports , 68.53 percent .  Almost all the light industry , textile , garments , toys , and metal export products are provided by the small and medium-size enterprises .  
A new international political and economic order should be based itself upon the universally recognized norms governing international relations , meet the need of the development and progress of our times and reflect the spirit of peace and equality .  It should ensure that all countries , regardless of their size , wealth and strength , are all equal members of the international community .  
The CMC stressed the need to finish all the tasks of reducing the size of the armed forces by half a million in the last year of the three-year deadline .  Moreover , the armed forces should concentrate their limited financial resources on striving to effect , in the shortest possible time , a complete change from a manpower-intensive and numerically large type to a technology-intensive and quality-based efficient one to ensure that they can cope with a hi-tech local war that may break out at any time .  
There are three basic principles that must be emphasized in establishing a new peaceful , stable , fair and rational international political and economic order : First , all countries should be equal irrespective of their size .  Second , the right of the peoples of various countries in choosing the road of development according to respective national conditions should be respected .  Third , the sovereignty of all countries should not be violated and under no pretext should the internal affairs of other countries be interfered in .  
The course of developing our bilateral relations in the nine years since China and Estonia established diplomatic ties shows that the bilateral relations can develop smoothly as long as both sides strictly adhere to the principle of mutual respect , mutual benefit on an equal footing , mutual non-interference in each other 's internal affairs , equality among all countries regardless of size , and abide by the spirit of the China-Estonia Joint Communique and Joint Statement on Establishment of Diplomatic Relations .  
In 1997 , at the 15th CPC National Congress , Chairman Jiang Zemin declared to the whole world : Following the 1-million personnel retrenchment in the 1980s , China will further cut down the personnel size of its army by 500,000 in the next three years .  In order to implement this strategic decision made by Chairman Jiang and the party Central Committee , the PLA has readjusted the organizational establishment of its troops ; reformed its logistic support , weaponry management , and the structure of its military academies and training institutions ;  
The industrial structure in central and western regions has also shown a tendency toward optimization , with the quality of economic operations significantly enhanced .  In the first four years under the Ninth Five-Year Plan , the relative size of the secondary industry in central and western regions steadily expanded ;  
The accurate information obtained on the size and makeup of our population will provide a reliable basis for formulating China 's social and economic development strategies and plans for the 21st century , raising the people 's overall living standards , and implementing the strategy of sustainable development .  
The ore bed is made up of three to four strata of main ore body .  The exposed width of the strata combined is about 800 meters on average and the grade of the titanic schorl is between 2% and 4.1% .  Calculated on the basis of a 50-meter depth from the earth 's surface , the reserves of the titanic schorl deposit within this area amount to more than 50 million metric tons , equivalent to the size of 500 large titanic schorl beds .  
According to an informed personage , in light of the rapid development of Internet and in accordance with the instruction of its high-ranking authorities , China recently expanded the authorized size of " Internet police " responsible for supervising the Internet . China has defined in an even more clear terms the work of the " Public Information Network Supervision Bureau " of the Ministry of Public Security , which was established last year .  
The authorities have not been slack in carrying out the supervision work in medium and small cities as well as in grassroots units .  At present , the first-class cities nationwide have formally established special " Public Information Network Supervision Departments . " As a result , the authorized size of Internet police has reached more than 300,000 .  
If economic growth slows down or if recession emerges in following years , original estimated revenue will decrease and the Bush administration will be caught in a dilemma in a tax cut .  It will either cause new financial deficits by cutting tax according to the original plan or be dissatisfied by enterprises and the broad masses of voters , especially people of the upper middle class , if he shrinks the size of a tax cut .  
According to the white paper " China 's National Defense in 2000 " published in mid-October of this year , since 1995 China has declared two rounds of military cuts , which resulted in the cutting of a total of 1.5 million personnel from the military , thereby significantly reducing the size of the military and streamlining military establishments .  Now the established size of the entire military is kept under the level of 2.5 million personnel , and consequently the Chinese military has embarked on the road toward streamlined armed forces with Chinese characteristics .  
However , in general , the current level and size of bilateral economic and trade cooperation is still quite limited , and a great potential has yet to be tapped .  The leaders of the five countries affirmed the steady development of bilateral trade with China , but also expressed concern over the existing problems .  For example , the volume of trade is not large enough ;  
In the next five to 10 years , Guangxi will increase the number of cities , will strengthen the cities ' ability to gather various production factors and promote economic and social development in their surrounding areas .  The size of existing large and medium cities will be appropriately expanded .  The infrastructure facilities there will be improved and strengthened .  The level of urban planning , urban construction , and urban management will be further enhanced .

All election advertisements must be marked with serial numbers except a single sheet of paper not larger than A4 size bearing printing details , materials sent through the free postage service or by electronic means , and balloons .  
" Given the sheer size of the public and private sector foreign currency debts of the affected economies , the role of the international lender of last resort can not be fulfilled by the IMF or any single central bank without the participation of the private sector , " said Mr Yam .  
Another measure we are considering is how we can address the relative small size of the Aggregate Balance of the banking system in comparison with the large unregulated capital flows .  This and other specific measures would make our system even more transparent and open , but less susceptible to manipulative play that we have seen recently .  
Given sustained expansion and hence demand for capital on the Mainland , as well as the recovery of our economy , Mr Tung said he expected the overall size of our stock market to increase as the current global financial uncertainties receded .  
It consists of an indoor heated Olympic size main pool cum diving pool and the outdoor facilities .  This is the first local solar heated indoor swimming pool of the Pro RC and the water depth of half of the pool can be adjusted from 0 to 5 metres when necessary .

Printed materials on a single sheet of paper not larger than A4 size and bearing printing details , materials sent through the free postage service or transmitted by electronic means , balloons , T-shirts , caps , badges and carrier bags are exempted from this requirement .  
The issue will be divided into two portions for allocation in the primary market .  The bigger portion , with a minimum size of HK $ 400 mn , will be restricted for competitive bidding by the Recognised Dealers under the existing tendering mechanism administered by the HKMA for Exchange Fund paper and Specified Instruments ( including NIP notes ) .  
( b ) Generally speaking , the HKCEC 's charges are higher than those charged in Singapore , Taipei , Bangkok and Melbourne . There are , however , various reasons contributing to the differences , including the cost of living in the city concerned , market demand and supply , location of the facilities , transport and other ancillary facilities , standard of the services , size of patronage and availability of government subvention .  
Some are monumental in size , many are standing figures , and the most impressive format is the stele with one central Buddha and two attendant Bodhisattvas . Some fragments of figures are also included to show the prevalent artistic style .  
The Committee conducts annual reviews on relevant guidelines and examination measures and submits reports to the School Examinations Board for approval .  It also examines , with reference to the relevant guidelines , the recommendations put forward by the Secretariat on special arrangements for individual candidates , such as extended examination time and examination papers printed in larger font size or braille .  
The discussion paper contains suggestions about how the appropriate size of the DIS fund might be set , how it could be built up and maintained and how premium could be assessed for individual banks ( including the possible introduction of a differential premium system based on the supervisory ratings of banks ) .  
( a ) of the current number of private clubs in Hong Kong which pay land rents at below-market rates ; the name , location , membership size , entry requirements , actual annual or monthly land rent payable to the Government and the amount of such land rent that should have been paid if calculated in accordance with the market rate in respect of each of these clubs ;  
Instead of the US $ 16 billion asset size criterion , it is proposed that foreign banks should be subject to the same size criteria with respect to total assets and customer deposits as locally incorporated banks ( proposed to be increased to HK $ 5 billion and HK $ 4 billion respectively ) , thereby applying a consistent treatment to all applicants for a banking licence - irrespective of their place of incorporation . 
( b ) whether the movement of the price index has all along been a major consideration in determining the size of civil service pay adjustment , and whether an alternative formula has been adopted in the light of the price index falling to a negative level ; if so , of its rationale for that ?  
Having carefully considered the request of the Staff Side of SCSC , the Chief Executive is of the opinion that it is a matter of settled public policy that in determining the size of each year 's civil service pay adjustment , the Government takes into account the following factors : the net pay trend indicators derived from an independent private sector pay trend survey , the state of the economy , budgetary considerations , changes in the cost of living , the staff sides ' pay claims and civil service morale .

Will the Government inform this Council whether , up to the present , there are any groups or organizations which have applied to the Government for land by private treaty grant but have not yet been informed of the outcomes ; if so , the number and names of these groups or organizations , the size and premium per square foot at the current market value of the land concerned , and the relevant land lease term proposed by them ?  
Under the enhanced mechanism , Dr Yeoh said that a patient would be eligible to apply for a waiver for his medical expenditure at the public sector if the patient 's monthly household income did not exceed 75 per cent of the Median Monthly Domestic Household Income ( MMDHI ) applicable to the patient 's household size , and if the patient 's household asset was within a stipulated limit .  
For patients whose monthly household income are between 50 per cent to 75 per cent of the MMDHI applicable to their household size and pass the asset limit test , medical social workers will consider their applications on a case-by-case basis in deciding whether a full or partial waiver valid for a defined period of time or one-off should be granted .  
As a general rule under the revised mechanism , a patient will be eligible to apply for a waiver for his medical expenditure at the public sector if the patient 's monthly household income does not exceed 75 per cent of the Median Monthly Domestic Household Income ( MMDHI ) applicable to the patient 's household size , and if the patient 's household asset is within a stipulated limit .  
" Although it is inherent in the established civil service pay adjustment mechanism that some of the factors for determining the annual civil service pay adjustment may have a positive or negative impact on the size of the pay adjustment , the contractual employment arrangements between the Government and the vast majority of serving civil servants do not contain an express provision authorising the Government to reduce pay .  
* a DPS Fund - with a target fund size of 0.3% of the banking sector 's total amount of protected deposits , which is equivalent to approximately HK $ 1.6 billion at the current level of deposits - would be built up in approximately five years  
Since 1998 , the size of the retained mortgage portfolio has grown at an annual compound rate of 25.6% to the current amount of HK $ 28.3 billion , which is close to 5% of the residential mortgage loan market , " said Mr . Antony Leung , Chairman of the Board of Directors of the HKMC in the report .  
While the differential treatment for child allowance between the first two children and the third to ninth child is unlikely to have a significant impact on the decision of a couple regarding the size of their family , the differential may not be appropriate in the light of our very low fertility rate and has been removed as from the current financial year . 
Members also observed that the technical measures introduced to improve the Currency Board system in 1998 ( including the introduction of the discount window and a substantial increase in the size of the Monetary Base ) had , through reducing the sensitivity of interest rates to speculative attacks , probably reduced the amount by which GDP and prices would decline following a speculative attack .  They noted , however , that there was , for the time being , insufficient empirical data for this to be clearly shown .  
After several years of intensive work , Mr . Chuang eventually produced a machine which is faster , processing up to 110 pieces a minute , only one thirteenth the size of the imported models , and only requires a three-quarters of a horsepower engine to operate . The waste rate is also low , with 82 kilograms of peeled asparagus obtained from 100 kilograms of the raw material .  
After being baked in electric , gas or charcoal kilns , and glazed , the artifacts come in a wide variety of colors ranging through coffee , gray and gray-green . Because of the size of the kilns , most of Lai 's models are small or medium sized .  
Anyone who sees the raw material after it is imported into Taiwan will inevitably ask : " How can these ugly-looking , twisted vines be transformed into such outstanding furniture ? " At the Ye Fun plant , each piece is measured and placed in a different warehouse according to size .  
Her works have also grown in size . Two years ago , she completed a painting 30 feet long by three feet high which she entitled " Garden of Life . " This panoramic ink and splash work won wide acclaim when it was exhibited in Japan and West Germany .  
Later the Taipei bookselling center moved to the Kuanghua Market , and Kulin Street dealers converted their stores into a downstairs part selling science and reference books and a cluttered upstairs featuring a wide array of stunning antiques . Many stores today on the third story of the Chunghua Market sell fine specimens of jade and pottery , and despite their small size and drab appearance , several boast an international reputation .  
It is planned that by the 1993 academic year , the number of teachers per class will have risen to 1.5 , and this standard would be maintained until the turn of the century . As to class size , it is hoped that it can be reduced from the present average of 43 students per class to an average of 40 students per class by the year 1993 , with further reductions thereafter until the number will have been reduced to 35 students per class by the year 2000 .  
In time to come , it will be comparable in size to the central commercial sectors of Taichung and Tainan . And the volume of economic activity in Hsinchu 's commercial sector will increase more than threefold . ( 4 ) Hsiang Shan Mountain City will become a scenic residential district .  
These flowers are not the same as common plants because they move about and they are probably five times the size of ordinary plants - - but common plants are no match for the beauty of these migrant plants which are purple , red , blue , yellow , and green colored suns - - their stalks are pretty girls and they float around rootless like duckweed .  
In that case , what do such marks and placings really represent ? In addition , newspaper opinion polls often do n't follow social science principles . Things like sampling procedure , model size , content of the questions and margin of error are vital indicators when deciding whether a poll is trustworthy . But polls can be distorted by neglecting certain aspects , either by cutting them out altogether or by burying them away in a brief comment near the end of the article .  
The US stands in sharp contrast to Japan , respecting the individual , pursuing happiness , favoring direct expression . Because of its vast size , attention is focussed on domestic matters , and there is a common lack of understanding of the outside world .  
Despite Taiwan 's small size , its tropical and sub-tropical climate and unique geography mean that it has a rich flora , many original varieties of which retain excellent characteristics . We need the government to set up a seed source bank to preserve these , while at the same time encouraging private enterprise to develop new improved varieties .  
It may be discovered by your hairdresser at the beauty parlor , or perhaps you wake up one day to find hair on your pillow , and lo and behold there 's a patch of scalp the size of a coin or an egg , perfectly devoid of hair . Near the root end the fallen hair is fine and paler in color , like an exclamation mark ; while the hair surrounding the spreading bald patch has turned lighter and finer and is easily plucked out .  
For example , some of the national parks in African nations can be as large as half the size of all Taiwan . Many local residents can only think that these areas are protected for tourism for the wealthy , while the profits are minimal , so there is no real incentive for Conservation .  
For instance , the tall and lanky General Hsieh whirls like a white crane spreading its wings opposite the short and stocky General Fan , who squats low and makes monkey-style kungfu movements . " Each of the dancers has a different character , and there is a dialogue between them , " says Chen Li-e , going on to explain that the generals ' movements and positions can be varied flexibly depending on the size of the space in which they perform .  
Although not distinguished for their size , Taiwan 's rivers did at least once run with water that was clear , and like major rivers elsewhere they played a central part in daily life . People rose with the dawn and retired at dusk , relying on rivers to supply drinking water , facilitate transport and answer religious needs , and so there was a bond that tied society to the river .  
" As our society becomes more open , people are less bothered about other people 's reproductive and marital choices , " says Chen Hsin-mu , but coercive structural forces in society are more powerful : " The cost in money and time of raising and educating a family is so heavy that it reduces the scope for flexibility in family size . Thus just as in mainland China , there is no scope for having extra children . "  
In a disordered wooden box , he had packed away things that were dug up by a backhoe when his family was rebuilding their house . Among these objects were pieces of " Taiwanese jade , " of a milky yellow with a tint of gray , and streaked with curving veins , about the size of NT $ 10 coins , but thicker . Some people conjectured that they were ancient coins . Others suggested they were pieces of jade cut away to make earrings .  
A well-designed domed facility should be highly flexible , with adjustable activity size , space , lighting , and sound . Also , to attract spectators , it must provide " full service , " including private boxes , food and beverage services , concessions to sell memorabilia , and so on . And to meet the needs of the press at major events , there must be TV broadcast facilities , a press box , darkroom , and phone and fax equipment .  
I think the fact that China had no huge concentrated structures is definitely related to the trend in thought of a longing for nature . China also has had its high structures , but these buildings are all stretched out on a level , and are not built upward or toward great size . After all , people are a part of nature , and we must remain connected to nature , and can not be cut off . Once you are cut off , people have so many special needs that they will inevitably pay a price .  
Winston Peters ' polemics about Asians have been reported to human rights organizations , and the Race Relations Office has not only expressed " concern , " but even published a full-page advertisement picturing four brains , of which three , of equal size , were labelled " Pakeha , " " Maori " and " Asian , " while the fourth , much smaller brain was labelled " Racist . "  
But Legislative Yuan members , local politicians and landowners rushed en masse to intervene , and the plan to " resurrect " Shihmen 's water sources was thrown out by the Ministry of the Interior . In August this year , after the disastrous typhoon , the residential , commercial and recreational zones around the Shihmen Reservoir were finally reduced in size .  
But most of them filled up as soon as they were built , and " almost the only one still functioning as a silt trap is the Junghua Dam , " says Chen Hsin-hsiung . Scholars estimate that the 133-meter-high Shihmen Dam has an actual depth of water today of less than 40 meters , and the effective storage capacity above the dam 's outlet is less than half its original size . The torrential rain of tropical rainstorms washes the upstream sand and gravel over the silt traps , through the reservoir and down to the plains .  
Using hot springs water to irrigate water convoluvus makes it grow to great size without being overripe . The sponge gourds are plump and firm , and they wo n't go dark when cooked . The whites of the water oats are really white , and the greens truly green with absolutely no black bit at the core .  
When we got to her place she pretended to be so drunk that she needed me to help her upstairs . But I 'm no fool . She would have ' banged ' me to death . " As the driver rattled on in this vulgar and offensive way , from time to time he would look in his rear view mirror to size up Zhang 's reaction .  
The internationalization of the Taiwan stock market has smashed the previous " mini-mart " situation of the last boom period . Given the expanded size of the market , plus the overall conceptual shift , some local experts have concluded : " Do n't worry ! The speculative money games of the past will never rise from the grave now . "  
Just as botanists describe , on the most inhospitable mountaintops , amid powerful winds , biting frosts and heavy snow , on dry , infertile soil where conditions are too harsh even for the Formosan cypress and Hinoki cypress which otherwise grow to such huge size , Taiwan 's Yu-shan rhododendron ( R . pseudochrys-anthum ) shrugs off the unrelenting onslaught of the elements and grows in thick clumps everywhere , changing the color of the mountain forests and grassland .  
In 1973 , it was generally agreed that jurisdiction over the media should be unified in a single agency . So the Executive Yuan took publication industry affairs from the Ministry of the Interior , and film and broadcast affairs out of the Bureau of Education and Culture , and moved both to the GIO . The GIO doubled in size overnight , assuming its current structure of six departments and three divisions .  
Chinese ink painting , on the other hand , approaches the canvas from a kind of " shifting " vantage point . Layer upon layer of mountain ridges overlap across the painting , a thatched hut enclosed by a bamboo fence rests at the mountain base , and a river runs along the summit , flowing off into the distance . Questions of height and distance are irrelevant ; everything seems to be encompassed by a single perspective . Even variations in size or brightness of lighting are lacking .  
On this point , Chen Chien-te argues that considering the level of funding and the size of the center 's staff , the light beams have been coming on line pretty fast . Still , to meet researchers ' needs , apart from doing all they can to make the light beams more powerful , they are also negotiating with the Japanese synchrotron center to co-fund three hard X-ray beams at the Japanese center that would be specially designated for use by Taiwan researchers .  
" The purpose of technology is to serve human cultural development , and the world has already reached a stage in which intangible assets are the most valued and the most valuable , " said Acer Group chairman and CEO Stan Shih at a press conference , adding that the main reason why software is so expensive in Taiwan is because of the small size of the local market .  
But in natural forests , every creature has its natural enemies , and the insect fungus Beauveria bassiana and parasitic flies are ready and waiting for M . basalis pryeri . Furthermore , in the wild the inchworms prefer trees over two meters tall , and by the time trees have reached this size they are strong enough for a few caterpillars not to pose them any threat .  
The problem was eventually fixed through the combined efforts of a number of American computer scientists . Realizing that the increasing size and complexity of computer networks made it impossible for any individual to discover all the holes within them , these scientists established the Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT ) at Carnegie-Mellon University . They hoped that by working together , network security issues could be predicted and resolved .  
Under Zhu Xi , who had a knack for " management , " private academies grew in size and became increasingly widespread . Especially worthy of note was the Bailudong Academy in Jiangxi . The latter , a famous institution nestled amidst mountains and rivers as idyllic as a painting , had fallen into decline in the Northern Song period .  
The special new trash bags , which come in six sizes , are not cheap-NT $ 7 per bag for the standard small size . It is estimated that this will result in a threefold increase in residential garbage fees compared with the old system . Just as the scheme was about to get off the ground , the supply of new trash bags was " held back " from the market by distributors . Residents were unable to obtain the bags from local stores , triggering further complaints about the new system .  
Where I live in northwestern Switzerland , small municipal refuse bags , which hold 17 liters , cost around NT $ 30 each . Even the largest size of bags only hold 110 liters , yet cost NT $ 108 . This is definitely much more expensive than in Taipei City , but I 've never heard anyone complain that the bags are too dear . I think this is because they do a good job of reducing and separating their waste .  
While the advantages of the PRC are undeniably clear-the market is huge , labor costs are low , and firms can easily move into both the domestic and international markets-this swarming of Taiwanese investors , each seemingly determined to outdo the ones before in size , has generated its own ill-effects which are now gradually coming to the surface .  
The GalaxyChip design involves cutting up a traditional polymer chip , around one square centimeter in size , into tens of thousands of much smaller chips only 100 microns across-a tenth of the thickness of a human hair . These tiny chips are " as numerous as stars in the sky " - hence the name GalaxyChip .  
Both spiders and insects are arthropods , but they have very different body patterns . Insects have six legs and a distinct head , thorax and abdomen , but spiders ' bodies are divided into only a " cephalothorax " ( combined head and thorax ) and abdomen , along with eight hairy legs that may be many times longer than the size of their bodies . They are very unique in form , and have some remarkable physical attributes . Spiders have fully developed digestive , circulatory , respiratory and nervous systems .  
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) , with over 170 member states , places wild animals into one of four categories depending upon the size of their surviving populations and how endangered the species may be . Various controls and limitations on import , export , and trade are then imposed for the various categories . Protected animals may only be imported under certain conditions , such as for educational purposes or medical treatment , but not for profit .

People rose with the dawn and retired at dusk , relying on rivers to supply drinking water , facilitate transport and answer religious needs , and so there was a bond that tied society to the river .  
" As our society becomes more open , people are less bothered about other people 's reproductive and marital choices , " says Chen Hsin-mu , but coercive structural forces in society are more powerful : " The cost in money and time of raising and educating a family is so heavy that it reduces the scope for flexibility in family size . Thus just as in mainland China , there is no scope for having extra children . "  
In a disordered wooden box , he had packed away things that were dug up by a backhoe when his family was rebuilding their house . Among these objects were pieces of " Taiwanese jade , " of a milky yellow with a tint of gray , and streaked with curving veins , about the size of NT $ 10 coins , but thicker . Some people conjectured that they were ancient coins . Others suggested they were pieces of jade cut away to make earrings .  
A well-designed domed facility should be highly flexible , with adjustable activity size , space , lighting , and sound . Also , to attract spectators , it must provide " full service , " including private boxes , food and beverage services , concessions to sell memorabilia , and so on . And to meet the needs of the press at major events , there must be TV broadcast facilities , a press box , darkroom , and phone and fax equipment .  
I think the fact that China had no huge concentrated structures is definitely related to the trend in thought of a longing for nature . China also has had its high structures , but these buildings are all stretched out on a level , and are not built upward or toward great size . After all , people are a part of nature , and we must remain connected to nature , and can not be cut off . Once you are cut off , people have so many special needs that they will inevitably pay a price .  
Winston Peters ' polemics about Asians have been reported to human rights organizations , and the Race Relations Office has not only expressed " concern , " but even published a full-page advertisement picturing four brains , of which three , of equal size , were labelled " Pakeha , " " Maori " and " Asian , " while the fourth , much smaller brain was labelled " Racist . "  
But Legislative Yuan members , local politicians and landowners rushed en masse to intervene , and the plan to " resurrect " Shihmen 's water sources was thrown out by the Ministry of the Interior . In August this year , after the disastrous typhoon , the residential , commercial and recreational zones around the Shihmen Reservoir were finally reduced in size .  
But most of them filled up as soon as they were built , and " almost the only one still functioning as a silt trap is the Junghua Dam , " says Chen Hsin-hsiung . Scholars estimate that the 133-meter-high Shihmen Dam has an actual depth of water today of less than 40 meters , and the effective storage capacity above the dam 's outlet is less than half its original size . The torrential rain of tropical rainstorms washes the upstream sand and gravel over the silt traps , through the reservoir and down to the plains .  
Using hot springs water to irrigate water convoluvus makes it grow to great size without being overripe . The sponge gourds are plump and firm , and they wo n't go dark when cooked . The whites of the water oats are really white , and the greens truly green with absolutely no black bit at the core .  
When we got to her place she pretended to be so drunk that she needed me to help her upstairs . But I 'm no fool . She would have ' banged ' me to death . " As the driver rattled on in this vulgar and offensive way , from time to time he would look in his rear view mirror to size up Zhang 's reaction .  
The internationalization of the Taiwan stock market has smashed the previous " mini-mart " situation of the last boom period . Given the expanded size of the market , plus the overall conceptual shift , some local experts have concluded : " Do n't worry ! The speculative money games of the past will never rise from the grave now . "  
Just as botanists describe , on the most inhospitable mountaintops , amid powerful winds , biting frosts and heavy snow , on dry , infertile soil where conditions are too harsh even for the Formosan cypress and Hinoki cypress which otherwise grow to such huge size , Taiwan 's Yu-shan rhododendron ( R . pseudochrys-anthum ) shrugs off the unrelenting onslaught of the elements and grows in thick clumps everywhere , changing the color of the mountain forests and grassland .  
In 1973 , it was generally agreed that jurisdiction over the media should be unified in a single agency . So the Executive Yuan took publication industry affairs from the Ministry of the Interior , and film and broadcast affairs out of the Bureau of Education and Culture , and moved both to the GIO . The GIO doubled in size overnight , assuming its current structure of six departments and three divisions .  
Chinese ink painting , on the other hand , approaches the canvas from a kind of " shifting " vantage point . Layer upon layer of mountain ridges overlap across the painting , a thatched hut enclosed by a bamboo fence rests at the mountain base , and a river runs along the summit , flowing off into the distance . Questions of height and distance are irrelevant ; everything seems to be encompassed by a single perspective . Even variations in size or brightness of lighting are lacking .  
On this point , Chen Chien-te argues that considering the level of funding and the size of the center 's staff , the light beams have been coming on line pretty fast . Still , to meet researchers ' needs , apart from doing all they can to make the light beams more powerful , they are also negotiating with the Japanese synchrotron center to co-fund three hard X-ray beams at the Japanese center that would be specially designated for use by Taiwan researchers .  
" The purpose of technology is to serve human cultural development , and the world has already reached a stage in which intangible assets are the most valued and the most valuable , " said Acer Group chairman and CEO Stan Shih at a press conference , adding that the main reason why software is so expensive in Taiwan is because of the small size of the local market .  
But in natural forests , every creature has its natural enemies , and the insect fungus Beauveria bassiana and parasitic flies are ready and waiting for M . basalis pryeri . Furthermore , in the wild the inchworms prefer trees over two meters tall , and by the time trees have reached this size they are strong enough for a few caterpillars not to pose them any threat .  
The problem was eventually fixed through the combined efforts of a number of American computer scientists . Realizing that the increasing size and complexity of computer networks made it impossible for any individual to discover all the holes within them , these scientists established the Computer Emergency Response Team ( CERT ) at Carnegie-Mellon University . They hoped that by working together , network security issues could be predicted and resolved .  
Under Zhu Xi , who had a knack for " management , " private academies grew in size and became increasingly widespread . Especially worthy of note was the Bailudong Academy in Jiangxi . The latter , a famous institution nestled amidst mountains and rivers as idyllic as a painting , had fallen into decline in the Northern Song period .  
The special new trash bags , which come in six sizes , are not cheap-NT $ 7 per bag for the standard small size . It is estimated that this will result in a threefold increase in residential garbage fees compared with the old system . Just as the scheme was about to get off the ground , the supply of new trash bags was " held back " from the market by distributors . Residents were unable to obtain the bags from local stores , triggering further complaints about the new system .  
Where I live in northwestern Switzerland , small municipal refuse bags , which hold 17 liters , cost around NT $ 30 each . Even the largest size of bags only hold 110 liters , yet cost NT $ 108 . This is definitely much more expensive than in Taipei City , but I 've never heard anyone complain that the bags are too dear . I think this is because they do a good job of reducing and separating their waste .  
While the advantages of the PRC are undeniably clear-the market is huge , labor costs are low , and firms can easily move into both the domestic and international markets-this swarming of Taiwanese investors , each seemingly determined to outdo the ones before in size , has generated its own ill-effects which are now gradually coming to the surface .  
The GalaxyChip design involves cutting up a traditional polymer chip , around one square centimeter in size , into tens of thousands of much smaller chips only 100 microns across-a tenth of the thickness of a human hair . These tiny chips are " as numerous as stars in the sky " - hence the name GalaxyChip .  
Both spiders and insects are arthropods , but they have very different body patterns . Insects have six legs and a distinct head , thorax and abdomen , but spiders ' bodies are divided into only a " cephalothorax " ( combined head and thorax ) and abdomen , along with eight hairy legs that may be many times longer than the size of their bodies . They are very unique in form , and have some remarkable physical attributes . Spiders have fully developed digestive , circulatory , respiratory and nervous systems .  
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) , with over 170 member states , places wild animals into one of four categories depending upon the size of their surviving populations and how endangered the species may be . Various controls and limitations on import , export , and trade are then imposed for the various categories . Protected animals may only be imported under certain conditions , such as for educational purposes or medical treatment , but not for profit .  
The participants were managers of publishing companies from Europe , the United States , and Japan . Speaking from direct experience , they emphasized that company size was not relevant to survival . Small companies have much greater room to publish creative publications . The operating principles that will always hold true for publishing houses are selecting the right works for publication and producing high quality books .  
That afternoon , the sky suddenly turns black and a strong wind comes up , and raindrops the size of coins-seemingly racing to the ground-come crashing down on the corrugated steel roofs of buildings , raising a racket that shakes the very air . It is like an invading army , and I watch as the water fills the embassy compound , then begins to seep into my office , and soon is washing over my feet . ( I must have made a comical sight . )  
Nautica won the affections of consumers with an appreciation for quality-made athletic clothing . Customers were first allured by the clothing 's colorful vitality and the unaffected simplicity of the design . However , upon further inspection they would discover that the clothing was very practical , as well . From the material and the tailoring work , to the location of the pockets and the adjustable sleeves , all the way down to minute details like the size of the zipper , Nautica 's quality was immediately self-evident .  
In recent years the daily customer traffic in the larger bookstores of major centers like Beijing and Shanghai has often hit the tens of thousands , and several have already been given " must-see " status in travel guides sold in Taiwan . To deal with the stream of visitors , the stores have expanded , improved their air-conditioning systems , taken on huge numbers of staff , and increased the width of the aisles between bookshelves ; the luxuriousness and sheer size of the stores is nothing short of amazing .  
In the next two years competition heated up as more people joined the industry . To find some special tools to give him an edge , Kung headed to Hong Kong . On his trip , he came across a kind of carved gourd known as an " egg gourd " in a department store . This egg gourd , so named for its size and shape , was a magnificent work of skill and beauty , and enraptured him .  
qian noted that the two countries differ greatly in population and size but both , situated in asia pacific region , are developing countries and are confronted with the common task of safeguarding the regional peace , developing their own countries ' economies and raising people 's living standards  
These include their small size and relative geographic remoteness , a narrow range of resources , severe population stress , sometimes minimal renewable fresh water resources , and high degrees of endemism .  
To these we must add size and strategic location , economic power - both present and potential - pace of industrial growth and technological progress as well as human and natural resources .

The Bank 's policy in regard to lending outside the European Union has been based on detailed economic and technical analysis of alternative solutions and the optimum size and timing of project implementation , together with their environmental impact .  
Small size also means that our entire society , not just areas of it , is equally vulnerable to dislocations of the global economic system , including currency and commodity price fluctuations , new international trading arrangements , and the changing fortunes of the major industrial economies .  
To achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development we need a supportive and favourable international economic environment as well as a fair , open and non-discriminatory trading system , one which recognizes that small and vulnerable economies like our own are at a particular disadvantage because of our size and the lack of economies of scale .  
At that size , the Council 's representative character would be enhanced , while at the same time the necessary ability for prompt , effective and continuous action , as required by the Charter , would be preserved .

Experience seems to recommend , however , on the one hand , the systematic designation , for all operations of whatever size , of a special representative of the Secretary-General having complete authority over the various components of the operation and , on the other hand , at least for peace-restoration and conflict-moderation operations , which almost inextricably link military tasks ( even including combat ) with negotiation and humanitarian aid activities , an integrated structure involving close cooperation between civilians and military personnel at all levels of command , including logistics .  
This force , at 9 per cent of the size of the multinational force which intervened in September 1994 to establish a stable and secure environment , and one third the size of the currently mandated UNMIH , was designed to be of sufficient strength to be capable of executing the military mission it was being assigned , and no more .

At a time when profound changes are taking place in the international arena and the United Nations is being increasingly called upon to face new challenges that are not always conciliatory and require the concerted efforts of all Member States , regardless of size , geographical situation or economic and military might , it is vital that a broad programme of comprehensive reform of the multilateral institutions be adopted to further measures , in a decisive manner , for the democratization of international relations based on the rule of law and the mutual benefit of States .  
My delegation believes that our proposals on the size of the permanent membership and on the size and geographical composition of the non-permanent membership are a material and proper approach to the reform of the Security Council if the Council is to continue to have credibility as an institution which is representative of the international community as a whole and which therefore has the legal and moral authority to act on its behalf .  
The widespread incorporation of information technology in production and communications has considerably reduced the physical size of factories ( by increasing the versatility of machines , thereby lowering the number of machines required for different sequences of operations ) , expanded the variety of jobs that can be performed , and improved the precision in production and quality control that can be achieved by a worker , and ( through instant information connectivity ) greatly enhanced intra - and inter-firm spatial networking to maximize location-specific advantages .  
Natural resource endowments , the level of development of the industrial base and of the physical and communications network , the size of the domestic market and the degree of integration of the domestic economy , the technological capacity and availability of adequate human capital in terms of skills , and the proximity to major production and consumption poles are elements in which developing countries also exhibit differences among themselves .

The current rules on equitable representation are based on two criteria , the first being the base figure of posts subject to geographical distribution , the second being the notion of a midpoint or number of posts attributable to each member State , which itself is exclusively governed by two factors : membership in the Organization , which automatically entitles a State to a minimum quota , and the size of a member State 's contribution to the operating budget .  NULLThe base figure is the number of posts theoretically subject to geographical distribution .
