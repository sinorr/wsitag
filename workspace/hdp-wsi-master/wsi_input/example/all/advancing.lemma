Knowledge and qualified personnel , national quality , and innovation capability have increasingly become important indicators of comprehensive national capability and critical factors of advancing or constraining economic growth and social development .  
Have personal quality education permeate all such stages as preschool education , elementary and secondary school education , vocational education , adult education , and higher education as well as all categories of education , and all such aspects as school education , family education , and social education , so that the different stages and aspects have different contents and emphases but are also closely linked to each other and in mutual cooperation , advancing as an integral whole .

In the past five years , this country that is in the midst of advancing socialist modernization not only reined in the unbridled horse of inflation , but also curbed the trend of deflation .  China accomplished the unusual feat of yearly economic growth of eight percent accompanied by improvement of quality and efficiency of economic growth .  
In the current international circumstances which are undergoing profound changes , while concentrating our strength on advancing the modernization drive and continuing to open up to the outside world , we must keep ourselves sober-headed against the infiltration of the Western ideology .

In the process of accelerating and advancing military modernization , if our military 's party members uphold obsolete ideas and concepts , lack high scientific and technological attainment , and lack the ability to skillfully use modern weapons and armaments and to give appropriate commands in modern wars , it will be difficult for these party members to embody the advanced nature of the party members and make great achievements in the military 's reform and construction .  
It is very difficult see the embodiment of the advanced nature in party members like these .

Hegemonism and power politics still exist and make new developments in the fields of international politics , economy , and security .  Military interventionism has further increased .  
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi commented today at a press conference that China is carrying out a peaceful policy of foreign diplomacy in which independence and initiative is maintained .
