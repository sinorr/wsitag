Sound and sustainable macroeconomic policies , political stability , good governance , physical and institutional infrastructure and human resource development are a prerequisite for encouraging increased investment in Africa ;  
The wide and equitable distribution of scientific and technological knowhow and capacity at the national and international levels is essential for the achievement of sustainable development .  
Determined to promote regional cooperation for the development and practical application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ,  
The global partnership for sustainable development entered into during the recent years was based on the provision to the developing countries of substantial , new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements .  
The strategies , policies and programmes of States will promote sustainable development and the wellbeing of current and future generations by fostering a better life for human beings in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental domains .  
The sustainable management of natural resources and the improvement of environmental quality are mechanisms for protecting the ecological processes and the genetic diversity essential for the maintenance of life .  
Noting the fact that the net transfer of resources to the developing countries has been positive for the past two years and that a supportive international economic environment is of critical importance if such transfers are to be sustainable ,  
Such cooperation was aimed at preserving the marine environment and living resources , disposing of toxic wastes , developing coastal infrastructure and taking joint action to promote sustainable development in border areas .  The meeting rose at 5.40 p.m .  
" Noting the fact that the net transfer of resources to the developing countries has been positive for the past two years and that a supportive international economic environment is of critical importance if such transfers are to be sustainable ,  
He referred to the recent visit to China by the SecretaryGeneral who not only pointed out the critical role of international peacekeeping in promoting global security but also the vital importance of sustainable social and economic development .  
At that meeting it was also said that better quality of life for all was the objective of sustainable development , the foundations of which are democracy , human rights , transparent and responsible management of public affairs , investment in the human individual and protection of the environment .  
At the very heart of this Programme is the acknowledgement of the inextricable interdependence between the need for transparent , accountable and democratic governance of our society and the imperative of dynamic economic growth and sustainable development .  
Emphasis has also been placed on the reform of the public sector and the provision of basic infrastructure in order to ensure the efficient delivery of reliable , high-quality services , the progressive restructuring of our educational system so as to put in place a sustainable human-resource development programme which would respond to the new challenges and needs of our development , and the employment of social policies aimed at protecting the most vulnerable in our society .  
The Beijing Conference , along with the other global conferences held at Rio , Barbados , Cairo and Copenhagen , have served to buttress the case for an integrated approach to sustainable development , which must be informed by environmental , social , demographic , gender and human - resource considerations .  
To achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development we need a supportive and favourable international economic environment as well as a fair , open and non-discriminatory trading system , one which recognizes that small and vulnerable economies like our own are at a particular disadvantage because of our size and the lack of economies of scale .  
Development is not sustainable if 17 hurricanes are to trample through our region each year ; yet climate experts have given us notice that the phenomenon known as global warming will generate a greater number of extreme weather events , more ferocious and monstrous in each succeeding year . 
My delegation is confident that improved cooperation between developed and developing countries and the consolidation of related agencies and programmes would lead to enhanced prospects for the discovery of solutions to global problems and for the promotion of sustainable economic , social and cultural development .  
The commitment of resources at both the national and international levels ought to be focused on the development of programmes that place priority on the development of human capacities , and removing institutional and infrastructural impediments in order to facilitate sustained economic growth and sustainable development . 
We have moved from an authoritarian Central America divided by war to a democratic and united Central America which today is building its future through a regional alliance for sustainable development .  
There is extraordinary cooperation on the part of States , other political entities and non-governmental organizations in the dozens of areas of substantive concern of the United Nations organs ; in the burgeoning , multidimensional sphere of sustainable development ; in the territory where humane concerns and values , social ordering and cultural norms coalesce ; and in the field of peace-keeping , of providing States and peoples with security from violence and disorder .  
The new principles of regional integration are based on respect for life in all its forms ; constant improvements in the quality of life ; respect for the vitality and diversity of our land ; peace , participatory democracy ; respect for and the promotion and protection of human rights , and respect for the multiculturalism and ethnic diversity of our peoples ; the economic integration of our region with the rest of the world ; and a responsibility that spans generations for sustainable development .  
We share the Secretary-General 's positive outlook , which is based on the prospect of the region 's being free of armed conflicts and effecting institutional changes capable of supporting new programmes of social and economic reforms that will make it possible to consolidate sustainable development .  
In this respect , it must be emphasized that a solid democratic and pluralistic system , based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the covenants and international conventions on human rights , is closely linked to the implementation of policies aimed at promoting sustainable development , improving the standard of living of the lowest-income segments of society , and promoting civil and political freedoms and equality of opportunities . 
The European Union believes that there are compelling reasons for reforming the United Nations system , particularly in the economic , social and related fields , so that it can meet the growing challenges of a complex and interdependent world , preserve its relevance in that world and make a meaningful contribution to sustainable development .  
The agenda of the latest meeting between the two organizations included a number of issues of paramount importance , including political questions , such as the maintenance of international peace and security ; humanitarian issues , such as mine clearance ; and such economic and social issues as desertification control , protection of the environment , sustainable development , narcotics control and crime prevention .  
Although useful as a way of promoting the economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries , South-South cooperation is no substitute for international cooperation , which , in the interests of the harmonious development of an interdependent world , must , inter alia , guarantee financial , technical and technological assistance to developing countries .  
The major international conferences organized by the United Nations have proven a useful means of studying basic questions relating to the goal of social emancipation and genuine sustainable development in all countries . 
We consider that implementation of the Programme of Action is urgent , with a view to establishing a framework for economic growth and sustainable development , and a national and international climate favourable to social development , to the elimination of poverty , to increasing productive employment , to reducing unemployment and to fostering social integration .  
The national reconstruction plan and the economic and social development plan are based primarily based on sustainable human development through medium - and long-term programmes targeting the population affected by the conflict and the most vulnerable sectors of society in order to improve the quality of life and social mobility by improving the systems of education , of health , of housing and of creating sustainable employment . 
It also urged the international community to increase the financial resource flows to Africa , as these are crucial to regenerate economic growth and sustainable development , and to provide effective support to political reforms and help cushion their adverse social consequences .  
Furthermore , other recent endeavours , including the 1995 Agreement on straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and the work of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , reflect the determination of the international community to develop and strengthen the global legal order for the sustainable development of the living and non-living resources of marine and coastal waters .  
The vital instrument has laid a legal regime to govern the conservation and management of fisheries resources , assuring the sustainable yield of fisheries and the protection of the earth 's fragile environment based on the shared responsibility of the international community .  
Fisheries by-catch and discards of by-catch are an increasing global economic , environmental and political concern , as States and relevant international organizations and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements attempt to rebuild depleted stocks , maintain biological diversity , protect endangered species and ensure maximum sustainable use of fishery resources .  
This is why we were pleased by the decision of the Secretary-General to establish three inter-agency task forces organized around the following key themes : the enabling environment for social and economic development , the meeting of basic needs ; and sustainable livelihoods .  
The New Partnerships Initiative ( NPI ) announced by the Vice-President at the Social Summit emphasizes work at the local level to build sustainable institutional capacity in three areas non-governmental organization empowerment across sectors , small - business partnerships and democratic local governance as well as efforts at the national level to ensure a supportive policy , regulatory and resource environment for private and community action .  
The World Summit for Social Development has been a landmark in that it has shown a strong common political commitment to direct efforts at the international level , as well as at the national and regional levels , towards sustainable development , especially for the benefit of the developing countries .  
In this regard , it is essential for African countries themselves to promote sustainable development and greater political stability through , inter alia , State structures adapted to the new realities , the establishment of democratic political systems , a responsible and transparent management of public affairs , and respect and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The African Group believes that the mid-term review of the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda will provide to Africa and the international community an opportunity to conduct an in-depth assessment of the actions so far taken to implement the New Agenda and the measures needed for sustained economic growth and sustainable development beyond the 1990s , as well as to set out new and corrective policies and measures for strengthened external support .  
Our member organizations are situated around the centre of the ideological scale , our main principles being the promotion of civil society , individual human and civil rights , the collective rights of minorities and other endangered peoples and the achievement of peace and security on the basis of sustainable development , environmental protection and free-market economy .  
In the context of our common endeavour we must encourage international cooperation in all possible uses of science and advanced technology for both military and civilian purposes so-called dual-use through the transfer and exchange of scientific and technical know-how for the peaceful purposes of promoting sustainable development and the preservation of international security .  
Bearing in mind that the Treaty of Chaguaramas , signed at Chaguaramas , Trinidad and Tobago , on 4 July 1973 , 1 / which established the Caribbean Community , created a permanent body for intraregional cooperation , consultation and coordination in order to enhance economic , social and cultural development , including the optimum utilization of available human resources for sustainable development ,  
The potential contribution of improved efficiency in meeting growing needs for energy services in a sustainable way in the rural areas of developing countries can be substantial , especially at the point of end use , by introducing new , efficient , low-polluting technologies and systems and by upgrading existing , inefficient systems .  
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy systems could be the largest single contributor to global energy supply , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 .  Such a development would not occur under " business as usual " conditions but would derive from sustainability policies and technological advances with regard to liquid , solid and gaseous fuel production from biomass .  
" Deeply concerned about the alarmingly high rate of loss of biological diversity , and determined to spare no effort for the conservation of the biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , " .  
In the knowledge that sustained economic growth and sustainable development were decisive for the integral realization of human rights , the United Nations should urgently focus on establishing a mechanism to ensure the balanced promotion of civil and political rights , on the one hand , and of economic , social and cultural rights on the other .  
Nationally determined policies for integrated and multifaceted programmes , with special attention to women , to the poorest people living in critical areas and to other vulnerable groups should be implemented , ensuring the involvement of groups with a special potential to act as agents for change and sustainable development .  
In addition to meeting basic health needs , specific emphasis has to be given to protecting and educating vulnerable groups , particularly infants , youth , women , indigenous people and the very poor as a prerequisite for sustainable development .  
Institutionalize a participatory approach to sustainable urban development , based on a continuous dialogue between the actors involved in urban development ( the public sector , private sector and communities ) , especially women and indigenous people ;  
Governments at the appropriate level , with the support of regional , subregional and international organizations , should , where necessary , enhance institutional capability to promote the multiple roles and functions of all types of forests and vegetation inclusive of other related lands and forest-based resources in supporting sustainable development and environmental conservation in all sectors .  
Recognize and foster the traditional methods and the knowledge of indigenous people and their communities , emphasizing the particular role of women , relevant to the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of biological resources , and ensure the opportunity for the participation of those groups in the economic and commercial benefits derived from the use of such traditional methods and knowledge ;  
To identify and strengthen or develop , as required , in particular in developing countries , the appropriate institutional , legal and financial mechanisms to ensure that water policy and its implementation are a catalyst for sustainable social progress and economic growth .  
To consider developing and issuing by the year 2000 a strategy of changes necessary to eliminate constitutional , legal , administrative , cultural , behavioural , social and economic obstacles to women 's full participation in sustainable development and in public life ;  
Ensure access for all youth to all types of education , wherever appropriate , providing alternative learning structures , ensure that education reflects the economic and social needs of youth and incorporates the concepts of environmental awareness and sustainable development throughout the curricula ; and expand vocational training , implementing innovative methods aimed at increasing practical skills , such as environmental scouting ;  
This was a matter dealt with by the World Conference , which recognized the need for a continuing adaptation of the United Nations human rights machinery to the current and future needs in the promotion and protection of human rights , as reflected in the Vienna Declaration and within the framework of balanced and sustainable development .  
The World Conference recognized the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society and strongly reaffirms the commitment of the international community to their economic , social and cultural well-being and their enjoyment of the fruits of sustainable development .  
Reaffirming that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and the preparedness against natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment , and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
Also reaffirms that such a dialogue should be conducted in response to the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development as well as improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development , and that the United Nations system should play a central role in facilitating such a dialogue ;  
In particular , the global POPIN Coordinating Unit and the regional Population Information Networks are working towards harnessing the tremendous potential of print , audiovisual and electronic media , including databases and networks , to disseminate technical information and to promote and strengthen understanding of relationships between population , consumption , production and sustainable development .  
Reaffirms the importance of creating a new model of regional security based on a reasonable balance of forces , the pre-eminence of civil authority , the elimination of extreme poverty , the promotion of sustainable development , the protection of the environment and the eradication of violence , corruption , terrorism and trafficking in drugs and arms , a commitment made at the fifteenth meeting of Central American Presidents ;  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity , and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reiterating the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources ,  
Actions are recommended to create , in a framework of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , a national and international environment favourable to social development , to eradicate poverty , to enhance productive employment and reduce unemployment , and to foster social integration .  
Governments increasingly recognize that their responses to changing circumstances and their desires to achieve sustainable development and social progress will require increased solidarity , expressed through appropriate multilateral programmes and strengthened international cooperation .  
The promotion of mutually reinforcing broad based sustained economic growth and sustainable development on a global scale , as well as growth in production , non-discriminatory and multilateral rule-based international trading system , employment and incomes as a basis for social development [ requires ] the following actions at the national [ and / or ] international level :  
Implementing sound and stable macroeconomic and sectoral policies which encourage broad-based , sustained economic growth and development that is sustainable and equitable , generate jobs , and that are geared towards eradicating poverty , reducing social and economic inequalities and exclusion ;  
Implementing measures to open market opportunities for all , especially people living in poverty and the disadvantaged , and to encourage individuals and communities to take economic initiatives , innovate and invest in activities that contribute to social development while promoting broad based sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure sustainable livelihoods ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
Strengthening international data collection and statistical systems to support countries in monitoring social development goals ; and encouraging the expansion of international databases to incorporate socially beneficial activities not included in available data , such as women 's unremunerated work and contributions to society , the informal economy , and sustainable livelihoods ;  
Pursuing the coordination of macroeconomic policies so that they are mutually reinforcing and conducive to broad-based and sustained economic growth and sustainable development , as well as substantial increases in productive employment expansion and a decline in unemployment worldwide ;  
Implementing macroeconomic and microeconomic policies in accordance with national priorities and policies , aimed at encouraging greater domestic savings and investment required for public spending , through progressive , fair and economically efficient taxes which are cognizant of sustainable development concerns , and through cutting back on subsidies that do not benefit the poor ;  
Inviting the international community , including the international financial institutions , to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development without falling into a new debt crisis ;  
Constraints are removed and incentives provided to ensure that desirable land uses are encouraged and are profitable ; land users have legal title to their land ; legal and tax systems do not result in disincentives to increased and sustainable land use ; adequate market and physical infrastructure are available ; the disadvantages and inequalities which particularly apply to women are remedied ;  
Mindful of the need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for sustainable development through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels ,  
Urges the international community to increase financial resource flows to Africa , as these are crucial in order to regenerate the growth and sustainable development of the African economies , to provide effective support to the political and economic reforms in which many African countries are now engaged and to help cushion adverse social consequences ;  
We commit ourselves to attaining the goals of universal and equitable access to quality education and to basic health services , without distinction by race , national origin , gender or age , and to preserving and promoting our rich and varied cultural heritage , as indispensable bases for people-centred sustainable development . 
However , can market forces ( a ) set an agricultural research agenda that though increasingly dominated by private commercial interests is oriented towards developing sustainable technologies , and ( b ) exert demand pressure for organic products so as to promote a significant shift towards more environment-friendly production practices ?  
They typically possess limited institutional and human resource capacity to assess the implications for sustainable agricultural and rural development of ongoing developmental plans .  
It seeks to foster development of sustainable agricultural production systems and to ensure that the following elements of sustainability are incorporated in the formulation and implementation of Bank-financed projects : increased and stabilized productivity ; rational use of natural resources ; enhancement of the quality of life and the environment ; and intergenerational equity .  
Within the changing context of sustainable development , developmental efforts should be able to pay its full costs , that is , the environmental and social costs ; for this reason resources have to be priced at or equal to the marginal value or scarcity rent and incorporated into development-related decision-making .  
Taking note of Economic and Social Council resolution 1994 / 51 of 3 November 1994 , in which the Council emphasized that the advancement of women should be an integral part of the economic and social development process within the main global issues , such as women 's particupation in the peace process , in national and international governance , sustainable development and gender equality ,  
The initiative aims to design sustainable natural resource management options to combat land degradation using indigenous and modern scientific principles integrated into improved production technologies .  
At the Paris ceremony , AfDB committed itself to play an active part in implementing the Convention , in line with the important role assigned to it under the provisions of the Convention , particularly in terms of integrated activities in key areas such as improving national economic environments , the sustainable use of natural resources , efficient energy use , capacity-building and sensitization .  
The objectives and activities contained in chapter 15 of Agenda 21 represent , therefore , a formidable challenge to Governments and relevant United Nations bodies , major groups and non-governmental organizations , among others , to improve the conservation of biological diversity and promote the sustainable use of biological resources , as well as to support the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant agreements in a coordinated and integrated manner .  
The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ( CGIAR ) continued to carry out research in partnership with national , regional and international genetic resources programmes as a means of strengthening the scientific basis for its work encompassing in situ and ex situ conservation and the sustainable use of plant , livestock and aquatic genetic resources .  
In the statement , the Conference noted that the Convention on Biological Diversity was the primary international legal instrument for advancing the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources .  
It decided to establish an open-ended ad hoc group of experts to consider without undue delay the need for and modalities of a protocol , containing appropriate procedures to be followed in the field of the safe transfer , handling and use of any living modified organism resulting from biotechnology that might have an adverse effect on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
The international scientific community , in cooperation with Governments , entities within the United Nations system , and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , need to make efforts to develop economic tools for determining the costs and benefits of the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of biological resources , and their distribution at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The main priorities of the programme on natural resources address issues relating to knowledge , the utilization and conservation of biological resources and diversity , the assessment of standing vegetation and its present and potential contribution to agricultural productivity , and the establishment of sustainable farming systems .  
sustainable use at various levels : the ecosystems / biogeographic realms level ( forests , arid zones , oceans , freshwater etc . ) ; the species level ( wildlife ) ; genetic resources level ( plant , animal and microbial resources , and natural resources economics ) ; the processes level ( biotechnology ) ; the monitoring and assessment level ; and the legal level .  
ECA provides advisory services and support to its member States on agriculture and rural development policies , planning and programming , with a focus on measures for the conservation of natural forests and their biodiversity , desertification and the related conservation of biodiversity , the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems and green belts in targeted countries , and the strengthening of regional cooperation programmes for the optimum and sustainable use of inland and marine fisheries .  
The Joint FAO / ECE Working Party on Relations between Agriculture and the Environment currently examines various aspects and national practices related to biological diversity and landscape protection as part of its work-plan element entitled Economic , legal , technological and regulatory measures for the promotion of environmentally sustainable agriculture and production of healthy food " .  
Emphasizing that the advancement of women should be an integral part of the economic and social development process within the main global issues , such as gender equality and women 's participation in the peace process , in national and international governance and in sustainable development ,  
The prevalence of absolute and relative poverty in mountainous regions and the downstream consequences of the degradation of mountain ecosystems are recognized as major reasons for mobilizing international efforts to assist countries 2 / to formulate and implement strategies for sustainable mountain development .  
It is expected that the regional intergovernmental workshops planned in preparation for a proposed world conference on sustainable mountain development in 1997 ( see para . 75 below ) will alert Governments and national agencies to the needs and potential for special national mountain agendas .  
In general , it was noted that the main factors constraining the development of sustainable national capacities include ( a ) the absence of an enabling public sector environment ; ( b ) the lack of a critical mass of suitably trained and motivated counterparts ; ( c ) high turnover ; and ( d ) the non-fulfilment of national budgetary and in-kind commitments .  
Other areas in which some progress has been made include the consideration of biological diversity ; the reservation of more primary forests ; the use of multi-purpose native species ; less regimented planting and management regimes for landscape and other environmental purposes ; the clear inclusion of forestry concerns into national sustainable development strategies ; and broadening end-use objectives beyond timber production to ecosystem management to sustain multiple benefits .  
Such results need to be made more accessible to low-income farming communities , farmers and forest-dependent peoples in developing countries so as to help enhance their sustainable livelihoods ; for that purpose , modern scientific and technological practices may need to build more systematically upon indigenous or local knowledge and practice .  
In chapter 2 and elsewhere in Agenda 21 , it was also agreed that sustainable development would require domestic reforms and international assistance in such areas as economic development , improved market access and commodity prices , environmental management , technology transfer , financing ( debt relief , foreign investment , official development assistance ) and institutional capacity-building .  
The Board held extensive deliberations on its future work , including a full exchange of views with the Secretary-General , who requested the Board to provide guidance on how the theme of sustainable development might be incorporated in each of the several forthcoming major conferences , and how the action programmes that emerged could be more effectively implemented .  
It identified five areas upon which efforts should be concentrated : economic restructuring that empowered women , creating sustainable livelihoods , building stable lives and healthy communities , peace building and conflict resolution , and ethical governance and respect for civil society .  
The criteria ( attached as annex II ) reflect the following top sustainable human development priorities for UNDP cooperation with Bangladesh : relevance to country programme objectives ; institutional and social sustainability ; environmental sensitivity ; targeting of the chronically poor ; affirmative action for women ; public management ; participation of beneficiaries and private organizations ; and national execution .  
Also emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic recovery and growth of the world economy , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ,  
In the area of poverty alleviation , sustainable human development will have to be promoted at the local level through support of the decentralization process and a strengthening of the technical , managerial and administrative capacity of local bodies , particularly departmental development councils and municipalities .  
The Convention on Biological Diversity is the primary international legal instrument for advancing the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources , while recognizing the important role of other conventions to the objectives of the Convention .  
It would also be desirable that future work on the protection of traditional knowledge and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant to conservation and sustainable use should be coordinated with the relevant bodies .  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in zones under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly the developing countries ,  
To summarize , the exact content and quantitative objectives of a Tunisian policy on sustainable human development , which will be reflected in the country strategy note , will emerge from the process of formulating Tunisia 's Agenda 21 and strategic studies conducted in the context of preparations for the ninth plan .  
Taking into account that the Economic and Social Council , in its resolution 1994 / 51 , emphasized that the advancement of women should be an integral part of the economic and social development process within the main global issues , such as gender equality and women 's participation in the peace process , in national and international governance and in sustainable development ,  
Acknowledging that there are links , under certain circumstances , between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , in countries affected by the illicit drug problem , that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Stressing the importance of trade as a major instrument of economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular developing countries and the need to find solutions to microeconomic issues of international trade which can significantly contribute to more open , dynamic and efficient trade relations ,  
Women , particularly through non-governmental organizations , participated in global , regional , national and community forums and strongly influenced the international debates on environmental management and conservation , human rights , violence against women , population and sustainable development , economic expansion and science and technology .  
Also encourages the above-mentioned organizations to contribute fully to increasing world awareness of the problems and potential of human settlements as important inputs to social progress and economic growth , and world leaders to commit themselves to making cities , towns and villages in their countries healthy , safe , just and sustainable ;  
Recognizing the important role that Governments and public administrations can play in addressing new responsibilities arising from the pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , including , inter alia , developing basic infrastructural facilities , promoting social development , combating socio-economic disparities and poverty , preparing , as appropriate , conditions for the private sector and protecting the environment ,  
By including this programme area in chapter 35 of Agenda 21 , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) recognized that development and natural resources management will be sustainable only if it is based on sound science , using the best scientific knowledge available and with continued research to improve the knowledge base .  
In addition to the financial means provided for this purpose , a number of United Nations bodies and organizations , including FAO , UNESCO , UNIDO and UNEP , have spent a considerable share of their regular programme funds on supporting programmes and activities related to science for sustainable development and scientific capacity-building in developing countries .  
Given the serious lack of resources and qualified personnel in the least developed countries , a realistic short to medium-term strategy for building scientific and technological capacity to manage the transition to sustainable development would be to concentrate on subregional measures rather than national ones .  
The Commission may wish to address appropriate measures to increasing financing for priority actions at the national level related to science for sustainable development , in particular scientific capacity-building in developing countries , and to formulate recommendations addressed to multilateral and bilateral donor agencies and Governments , as well as specific funding mechanisms , such as the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) .  
The new forces of modern science and technology , if harnessed properly and applied in accordance with each country 's particular socio-economic and cultural circumstances , offer immense possibilities for solving many of the complicated problems that are currently impeding economic , social and environmentally sound and sustainable development in the developing countries .  
The science addressed in chapter 35 is intended to provide the knowledge base for sustainable development and must therefore be designed to cover all facets of the complex problems of environment and development as they appear at the global , regional , and local levels .  
Despite considerable efforts , many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , do not yet possess a critical mass of trained personnel in specialized fields and in interdisciplinary approaches related to sustainable development .  
Recognizing that in many scientific fields related to sustainable development , such as climate change , the human dimensions of global environmental change , the global hydrological cycle , the assessment of freshwater resources , and oceans and regional seas , the generation of new knowledge needs enhanced international scientific cooperation , Governments , international organizations and the scientific community should join efforts towards : 
The concept of sustainable development is based on the conviction that it should be possible to increase the basic standard of living of the world 's growing population without unnecessarily depleting our finite natural resources and further degrading the environment in which we live .  
The private sector needs to be actively encouraged to contribute to efforts to work towards sustainable development through the development and use of environmentally sound biotechnologies that balance social , environmental and economic objectives and the dissemination of reliable and accurate information to the public .  
Action is urgently needed to facilitate the effective participation of developing countries in the process directed towards adopting realistic and up-to-date standards for intellectual property rights on biotechnology , taking into consideration new advances in and the understanding of biotechnology , as well as its crucial role in sustainable development , its potential impact on human society , and opportunities for mutually beneficial collaboration and cooperation .  
To encourage environmentally sustainable agricultural practices while moving away from overdependence on agrochemicals , UNEP , in collaboration with FAO , UNESCO and other relevant organizations , supported the regional Microbial Resources Centres ( MIRCENs ) in Cairo , Nairobi , Dakar , and Porto Alegre in demonstrating on a pilot scale the use of biological nitrogen fixation ( BNF ) for enhancing soil fertility and increasing legume production at the small-farm level .  
Adjustment programmes are designed to promote both macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform , and thereby to lay the foundations for high quality growth - a prerequisite for a sustainable and equitable improvement in living standards .  
Nevertheless , several countries state that in order to have a more sustainable impact , legal literacy should include developing an awareness of rights in general and of existing national statutory rights in particular , since penal and civil codes protect everyone .  
In fact such local-level agencies have emerged as a new locus of economic and social growth , providing innovative institutional arrangements through which family planning , health , education and income-generating activities can be integrated at the local level , ensuring environmentally sensitive sustainable development on a limited scale .  
Encourage major groups working in the population / gender field and in other sustainable development fields to increase their communication , cooperation and coordination at the local , regional and international levels in order to reinforce their contribution to the mutual understanding of these issues and to facilitate their active participation in the implementation of chapter 5 of Agenda 21 and chapter III of the Programme of Action ;  
They are relevant to decision-making by popularizing areas related to sustainable development and thus helping to create an informed public ; by providing technical data for scientists , engineers and other trained cadres who rely on these inputs for the analysis and recommendations that feed into the political process ; and by suggesting broad goals , objectives and policy options for discussion at intergovernmental forums .  
It would be desirable for the Commission to discuss more deeply the current and prospective role of the private sector in this regard , develop policy options for enlarging its role and explore the potential of related innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds , in particular for leveraging ODA and public expenditures on sustainable development .  
The purpose of integrated plans and strategies is to develop a consensual vision for the future and to identify common priority issues and key activities within a framework that provides for consensus-building and planning and the creation of the institutional support required for sustainable development .  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
[ Sustained economic growth and sustainable development can only be attained through improving the economic , social , political , legal and cultural status of women . ]

emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic recovery and growth of the world economy , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations at the Ministerial Meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee , held at Marrakesh , Morocco , from 12 to 15 April 1994 , and noting that the Uruguay Round agreements [ 8 ] / represent a historic achievement , which is expected to contribute to strengthening the world economy and to lead to more trade , investment , employment and income growth throughout the world and in particular to the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the developing countries ,  
also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations at the Ministerial Meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee , held at Marrakesh , Morocco , from 12 to 15 April 1994 , and noting that the Uruguay Round agreements [ 27 ] / represent a historic achievement , which is expected to contribute to strengthening the world economy and to lead to more trade , investment , employment and income growth throughout the world and in particular to the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , especially in the developing countries ,  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , and to improve access to the markets of all countries , in particular those of the developed countries , so as to generate sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the least developed countries and to enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
recognizing that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people , and that equitable social development , which empowers people living in poverty to utilize environmental resources sustainably , is a necessary foundation for sustainable development ,  
concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reiterating the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources ,  
concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reiterating the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources ,  
Welcomes , in pursuance of its resolution 49 / 22 A , the restructuring of the Special High-Level Council and the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Decade so that for the second half of the Decade they will provide the necessary support to global , regional and national policy and strategy development , public awareness-building and resource mobilization , and at the same time provide links with the scientific community and support the national committees for the Decade and national authorities in their cooperative efforts to integrate disaster reduction programmes into national activities for sustainable development ;  
that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and preparedness for natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by the Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
The solution should also be a comprehensive one based on prevention , mitigation of damage to the environment and the search for sustainable solutions , which should be based on the political will to protect , defend and promote human rights , guarantee the participation of citizens in government and create an enabling environment for economic and social progress .  
achievement of sustainable solutions required national , regional and international solidarity , which meant that financial and human resources exceeding the capacity of a single country or small group of countries had to be mobilized .  
Acknowledges that the administration of justice , including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and , especially , an independent judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in international human rights instruments , are essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable to democratization processes and sustainable development ;  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
that the prime objective of the New Agenda is to stop and reverse the continuing deterioration in the socio-economic situation of African countries and to renew the commitment of the international community to support Africa 's own efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Democracy , sustainable development , social justice , environmental protection and the promotion of global peace and security were goals which could not be achieved unless disputes were settled by peaceful means and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction was stopped .  
Requests the Government of Burundi to continue its efforts geared towards the achievement of national reconciliation and the lasting maintenance of peace , inter alia , through adherence to the principles of the Convention on Governance , provisions that are essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of humanitarian aid and economic , financial , material and technical assistance to the people of Burundi ;  
Redraft paragraph 8.3 as follows : " The main objectives of the Department will be the promotion of an integrated approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of development , including the elaboration of perspectives that will provide for sustainable , equitable and participatory development .  
Modernizing public administration in order to establish clear parameters for a modern , innovative civil service must include among its priorities the updating of the private sector and enhancing the ability to compete in foreign markets , while taking into account the economic and social balance required and ensuring sustainable development and employment .  
It is equally important for Governments to facilitate the development of productive sectors ; mobilize national energies and resources for the provision of human capital and institution-building , infrastructure and basic social services ; develop long-term analysis , planning and evaluation ; promote sustainable development and equitable distribution of growth benefits ; and ensure the coordination of all development activities .  
Significant political and economic changes are taking place all over the world , characterized by , among other things , a growing concern for democratization and good governance , by the increasing resort to privatization and greater reliance on market forces , by an enhanced awareness of the need to mobilize domestic resources and reduce fiscal deficits , by growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes and by greater recognition of the need to ensure that development is not only sustainable but also environmentally sound .  
At the same time , it is necessary to recognize what the Secretary General 's report points out : that the challenges which Governments worldwide face in establishing a framework of public administration and a financial system for sustainable economic development are not just domestic influences , but are also unpredictable external factors .  
Indeed , it is impossible to conceive of global and sustainable economic and social progress based on fairness and solidarity without a comprehensive and coherent concept of cooperation for development including , as the Secretary-General has recalled , a vital ethical element and without conception and coordination here in the United Nations in way that is not disjointed , scattered and possibly inconsistent .  How can we give the United Nations sufficient authority and credibility to consider effectively in this forum major global economic issues ?  
We should also remember that durable peace and sustainable development on a global scale can not be achieved unless all countries secure adequate living standards for their populations and overcome unemployment , poverty , social disintegration and environmental pollution .  
It is needless to stress that the elimination of poverty and the attainment of the broader goal of sustainable development will remain impossible to achieve unless nations show renewed political resolve to implement policies aimed at enabling humankind to better manage and live with its environment , as agreed to at the Rio de Janeiro summit and at subsequent Conferences .  
Can we refocus our energies on the four priorities of stemming the spread of weapons of mass destruction , bolstering United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building capabilities , advancing sustainable economic and social development , and reinforcing our joint commitment to international law and human rights ? 
Myanmar truly believes that we can overcome the political , economic and social challenges we face and avoid confrontation and chaos only if we seize the opportunity to extend and strengthen the Organization and promote a multilateral system based on the primacy of international law and freedom of choice and equality of all States . Disarmament , sustainable development , enhancement of the environment and suppression of narcotic drugs are priority issues that affect the security and well-being of peoples throughout the world .  
The Government of Bolivia 's current efforts are essentially based on the consolidation of participatory democratic institutions and on the conviction that economic development must be compatible with care for nature and the environment in other words , that this must take place within the framework of sustainable development and of respect for ethnic and cultural diversity , in order to make unity in diversity possible .  
It placed on record their deep conviction with regard to sustainable development ; it set forth precise guidelines on regional integration and trade ; it expressed a firm resolve to press ahead in the fight against drugs and related crimes ; it emphasized , in particular , the importance of the Inter-American Convention against Corruption ; and it reiterated emphatically the crucial importance Governments , from their position of lofty responsibility , attached to cultural integration .  
With the aim of laying the groundwork for a hemispheric agenda for sustainable development , several international meetings , starting with the Summit held in Miami in 1994 , have expressed support for the decision to hold a hemispheric meeting at the level of Heads of State and Government in the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra , scheduled for 7 and 8 December of this year .  
That meeting will be a new opportunity to set the course of national and international endeavours for sustainable development in the light of economic , social and environmental goals and in reaffirmation of the importance of obtaining new and additional resources to finance the plan of action to be adopted .  
Nevertheless , in the current context of increasing interdependence among States , international cooperation , especially the flow of capital and technology transfer from the developed to the developing countries is indispensable , and it is also necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of the developed countries themselves .  
In this connection , I wish to hail the World Solar Summit , held on 16 and 17 September 1996 in Harare , which helped to focus world political attention on the urgent and imperative need to provide reliable , sustainable and clean sources of energy to all the people of the world , including to the 400-million homes and the 2.4-billion people in the developing world who currently have no access to electricity .  
As expected , the series of global conferences held recently under the auspices of the United Nations , which involved not only Governments but also non-governmental organizations , civil society , the media and the private sector , have raised awareness of and built consensus around a number of overarching issues concerning economic growth and sustainable development .  
The series of United Nations global conferences signifies the international community 's preoccupation with the preservation of international peace and security , the promotion and preservation of human rights and fundamental freedoms , the propagation of development techniques and the attainment of sustainable development , the provision of adequate shelter for our rapidly growing population and , indeed , the attempt to ensure the social and economic well-being of all peoples all over the world .  
The Government , in partnership with other sectors of society , is playing a multiple role in improving living and working conditions on an equitable basis to enable all its citizens to enjoy adequate shelter , affordable basic services and sustainable human settlements .  
I am confident that the United Nations will continue to do its best to act as a catalyst in the achievement of peaceful coexistence among States , and to reinforce the notion of the interdependence of national aspirations and the common welfare of humanity , thus creating conditions conducive to the political stability and sustainable economic development of States .  
The goals of sustained economic growth , social development , environmental protection and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms set in the plans of action of several international conferences have sustainable development as their common denominator .  
In the context of collective international efforts towards the achievement of some kind of sustainable development in the less developed countries , it is instructive to refer to the recently held Group of Seven summit in Lyon , France , where most of the efforts focused on the new global order .  
Looking at current economic , social and political conditions on our continent , including the atrocities meted out to our own kith and kin , one is inclined to lose hope in the ability of Africa to achieve sustainable development .  
The establishment of the three inter-agency task forces on basic social services , employment and sustainable livelihoods and the enabling environment for economic and social development has proved to be instrumental in providing United Nations system-wide support and assistance , through Resident Coordinators , to national Governments in implementing the Summit goals .  
In conclusion , I wish to express my delegation 's sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Social Summit will help to generate renewed political will at the national and international levels to attain the objectives of sustainable human development .  
Rural development and prosperity-decentralization in the region have been expedited by building up economic and social basic services to catalyse sustainable rural development and by expanding the quality and quantity of basic services to meet the local demands of the country .  
Enhanced international technical assistance and advisory services can decisively strengthen national capacities and the institutional bases for supporting national plans and strategies that are designed to bring about sustained and sustainable social development .  
In its review of Agenda 21 the special session should lay the grounds for further international cooperation , national and regional initiative , and the mobilization of resources for meeting the sustainable development needs of small island developing States .  
Consistent with agreements reached at the regional level , Papua New Guinea has adopted a comprehensive code of logging practice designed to promote the sustainable use and in-country processing of a rich renewable natural resource .  
The outstanding features of this new model have been embodied in the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , which is a national and regional strategy to foster a change in personal and social attitudes to ensure the establishment of a model of sustainable development in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa , adopted by the General Assembly in 1991 , was a good initiative aimed at giving the international community the opportunity to review the deteriorating economic and social conditions on the African continent with a view to finding the proper solutions for them and to renewing the commitment to support Africa 's efforts to achieve continued economic growth and sustainable development .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) has focused on realizing sustainable growth and accelerating progress in agricultural development , food security , human resources development , rural and urban development , the establishment and maintenance of infrastructures , the creation of the appropriate social environment , and the enhancement of regional economic cooperation .  
With its unique approach , the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s was aimed at renewing the commitment of African countries and the international community to an agenda for the sustainable social and economic development of Africa in a spirit of global partnership based on shared responsibilities .  
If we agree that long-term , sustained growth and sustainable development depend on the private sector and on attracting foreign direct investment , then we must identify a true incentive for investment , since Africa , despite its conducive climate , is still unable to attract foreign direct investment .  
Only a few weeks ago , the mid-term review of the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) allowed us to measure the remarkable progress achieved by African countries at the political , economic and social levels to create and strengthen the conditions necessary for sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the continent .  
In order to achieve the major objectives of the New Agenda and the target growth rate of 6 per cent , the international community must accelerate its support to African countries in order to sustain the momentum leading to recovery and sustainable development in areas such as the further alleviation of the burden of external debt , the attraction of foreign private investment , increased official development assistance , trade facilitation and market access , and development assistance for capacity-building .  
As our Minister for Foreign Affairs , His Excellency Mr . Nguyen Manh Cam , stressed in his address to the General Assembly in the general debate , international cooperation and in particular capital flows and technological transfers from developed countries to underdeveloped countries are indispensable and indeed are necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of underdeveloped countries .  
We have developed , in close cooperation with the countries of the Caribbean region , a strategy based on three main priorities : support for the process of economic transition ; promotion of sustainable development of the Caribbean region with particular emphasis on human resource development , the protection of natural resources and combating socio-economic threats , including the fight against drugs ; and the promotion of increased economic cooperation leading to fuller integration in the world market .  
We have respectfully included the question of democracy in this debate because we do not think that any sustainable economic recovery is viable without a pluralistic and representative institutional framework or clear respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  The incremental measures contained in the Helms-Burton Act do not contribute to democratic transition in Cuba , nor do they make any real contribution to opening up the economy .  
That is , there should be systems of government with checks and balances , which guarantee the free exercise of the civil , political , social and cultural rights of the people , and which enhance the development of a free and dynamic society the only way to ensure harmonious and sustainable development .  
We have studied the report of the Secretary-General contained in document A / 51 / 338 and share his positive view that for the first time in three decades the region is free from armed conflict , giving rise to institutional reforms that can make it possible for there to be new social and economic reform leading to sustainable development helped by support from the international community .  
We propose that at its scheduled December 1996 meeting , the Quadripartite Committee for Coordination on Chernobyl specify the phases and modalities for advancing medical and environmental projects and programmes in order to ensure the sustainable economic and social development of Belarus and other most severely affected countries in transition , which find themselves in a critical situation as a result of the Chernobyl disaster .  
From the plundering of the oceans , the common heritage of mankind , by unsustainable fishing to the destruction of forests , the poisoning of air and water in disregard for environmental sustainability ; the destruction of communities , marginalization of whole segments of societies and eventually , civil unrest attributable to social unsustainability ; the world has seen the importance of pursuing sustainable development , whether in developed or developing countries or the economies in transition .  
There may be no other single individual who has been as instrumental or as effective in leading the world community in recent years in the difficult search for common ground , particularly on issues relating to environmentally sustainable development .  
In this sea of change in international relations , the whole concept of international security has increasingly moved away from the bipolar view , concerned largely with military security , to one which assigns a central role to sustainable development and the welfare of the individual .  
Decides that the basic problem of improving the capacity of developing countries and economies in transition to capture the maximum sustainable economic and social benefits of their potential for mineral production should be the principal focus of its inter-sessional activities and of the agenda of its fourth session , and requests the Secretary-General to prepare a discussion paper on this topic , with the assistance of members of the Committee .  
Emphasizes the need to implement sound and stable macroeconomic , micro-economic and sectoral policies that encourage broad-based economic growth and development that is sustainable and equitable , that generate jobs and that are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing social and economic inequalities and exclusion ;  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
Most of the efforts are directed towards the strengthening of operational capability of existing regional or national institutions involved in environmental management for sustainable development , natural resource monitoring or land-cover mapping .  
In response to the Working Group of the Whole of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , the Office for Outer Space Affairs has prepared or will prepare studies with the following titles : " Space applications for sustainable development " ; " Developing tele-education programmes through international cooperation " ; " Microsatellites and small satellites : current projects and future perspectives for international cooperation " ; and " Global exchange of scientific and technical information : networking possibilities for developing countries " .  
Themes found in both the guidelines and the common advocacy statement include putting people first ; promoting sustainable human development ; reducing gender inequality and inequity ; fostering accountability and transparency ; developing common indicators that are critical to the monitoring of programme impact ; strengthening country-level collaboration ; enhancing national capacity-building ; and facilitating dialogue between and among the United Nations resident coordinator system , Governments , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society . 
Energy is a critical factor in sustainable economic and social progress and development and , this being the case , developing countries are concerned about having secure and affordable sources of energy .  
Recognizing that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
Also recognizing that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people , and that equitable social development , which empowers people living in poverty to utilize environmental resources sustainably , is a necessary foundation for sustainable development ,  
She reaffirmed that the United States understood the term " sustained economic growth " as referring to " growth in the context of sustainable development " , consistent with paragraph 6 of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development , which read as follows : " We are convinced that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people .  
It established the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities of industrialized and developing countries in achieving sustainable development and made clear the responsibility of the developed countries for examining and changing their own consumption and production levels . 
The information base will be organized to identify key objectives of sustainable consumption and production and to report on broad strategies adopted to achieve them , specific characteristics and implementation challenges presented by different economic sectors and the policies and actions adopted by Governments and other major actors to address them .  
The Commission may wish to note the important role that has been played by the existing guidelines in influencing the development of national consumer legislation and to endorse the potential of the current revision process for promoting the principles of sustainable consumption at the national level and in fostering consumer understanding of the issues .  
Reaffirming the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990s on development , relating to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as the consideration of appropriate measures relating to the mobilization of substantial , new and additional resources to enable developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Emphasizes the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Further stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Welcoming the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations at the Ministerial Meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee , held at Marrakesh , Morocco , from 12 to 15 April 1994 , and noting that the Uruguay Round agreements [ 8 ] / represent a historic achievement , which is expected to contribute to strengthening the world economy and to lead to more trade , investment , employment and income growth throughout the world and in particular to the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , especially in the developing countries ,  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , and to improve access to the markets of all countries , in particular those of the developed countries , so as to generate sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to provide Nicaragua , at the request of its Government , with all possible assistance to support the consolidation of peace , democracy and sustainable development in such areas as caring for displaced persons , land ownership and land tenure in rural areas , appropriate care for war-disabled persons , mine clearance and the overcoming of difficulties in the restoration of the productive areas of the country , and , in general , a process of sustained economic and social recovery and development so that the peace and democracy already achieved become irreversible ;  
Resolutions of those organs have drawn the attention of Governments , the United Nations system and the general public to those problems and have called for action with regard to extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law as major obstacles to human rights .  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments which request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ; 
Politicians must be involved in its formulation ; politically compelling arguments for forest conservation and sustainable forestry development must be found ; and a critical mass of well-informed and motivated key decision makers committed to the plan or programme must be created .  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , 2 / in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
An ever-increasing awareness that the ocean is a basic governing force for life on this planet , particularly for small island countries , and that better understanding of its physical and biological mechanisms , including their interaction with atmospheric processes , is essential to decision-making aiming at sustainable development ; 
Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 called for governmental action , with the assistance of the specialized agencies of the United Nations system when required and with the active participation of the people and sectors involved and that of the non-governmental organizations , in order to : ( a ) improve the use and conservation of coastal resources through integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ( programme area A ) ; ( b ) increase marine environmental protection from land-based and sea-based sources of pollution  
A number of other actions can be noted , such as the 1993-1994 ban on the dumping of radioactive waste , sewage sludge and industrial waste and on incineration of toxic wastes at sea , as agreed in the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter ( London Convention ) ; ( c ) In relation to programme areas C and D , the legal framework for sustainable use and conservation of living aquatic resources in the oceans has been substantially improved since UNCED .  
Stressing the importance of the agreed international legislative and guiding frameworks for harmonious and sustainable development of the oceans , urge Governments to ( i ) ratify , as soon as possible , the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ; ( ii ) sign and ratify the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and , in the meantime , apply the Agreement provisionally ;  
Recognizing further the progress made during the post-UNCED process in developing international and regional standards and action plans relevant to the protection and management of coastal and marine environments and to the sustainable use and conservation of its resources , recommend that Governments : ( i ) continue to use existing mechanisms and forums to foster further progress ; ( ii ) actively participate in regional action plans , programmes and other cooperative arrangements ; and ( iii ) take advantage of international collaboration , particularly in the area of financing ;  
The objective of programme element I . 3 is to make proposals that will encourage countries - in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity - to consider ways and means whereby the traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers and indigenous and local communities can be effectively protected with a view to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , and the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices can be shared fairly and equitably . 
The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses specifically the need to respect , preserve and maintain the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , as well as the need to protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices .  
The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses specifically the need to respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , as well as the need to protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices .  
Such efforts can contribute to improving the linkage of rural settlements with the mainstream of economic , social and cultural life , to assuring sustainable communities and safe environments , and to reducing pressures on urban growth .  
Although many countries , particularly developing countries , lack legal , institutional , financial , technological and human resources to respond adequately to rapid urbanization , many local authorities are taking on these challenges with open , accountable and effective leadership and are eager to bring people into the sustainable development process .  
It offers , within a framework of goals and principles and commitments , a positive vision of sustainable human settlements - where all have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services , and productive and freely chosen employment .  
One of the purposes of the Central American Integration System , as set forth in the Tegucigalpa Protocol , is to attain the sustainable development of Central America , which presupposes defining a new , unique , comprehensive and indivisible regional security model inspired by the region 's achievements during its intensive process of pacification and integration ;  
A solution to the problems of personal security in the region will thus require a comprehensive and interrelated view of all aspects of sustainable development in Central America in its political , economic , social , cultural and ecological dimensions ;  
There is a sense of great opportunity and hope that a new world can be built in which economic development , social development and environmental protection as interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development can be realized through solidarity and cooperation within and between countries , and through effective partnerships at all levels .  
The empowerment of women and their full and equal participation in political , social and economic life , the improvement of health , and the alleviation of poverty are essential to achieving sustainable human settlements .  Paragraphs 10 and 10 bis should be joined as a single paragraph .  
[ Civil , ethnic and religious strife , nuclear armament , armed conflicts , alien and colonial domination , foreign occupation , international economic imbalance , coercive economic measures , poverty , organized crime , and terrorism in all its forms are destructive to sustainable human settlements development and should therefore be renounced by all States . ]  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
Partnerships among countries and among all actors within countries from public , private , voluntary , and community-based organizations , the cooperative sector , non-governmental organizations , and individuals are essential to the achievement of sustainable human settlements development and the provision of adequate shelter for all and basic services .  
Consistent with local needs and conditions , such efforts should include improving human settlements management , encouraging the sustainable development of intermediate cities that create employment opportunities for unemployed rural labour , and providing environmental infrastructure .  
Depending on the context and needs of the cities , towns and villages in each country and region , special attention should be paid to the most critical issues , such as changing production and consumption patterns ; energy efficiency ; sustainable resource and land-use management ; [ poverty eradication ; population and health ; water supply , sanitation and waste management ; disaster prevention , mitigation , preparedness and management ; cultural and historical heritage ; environmental protection ; industry ; infrastructure ; and basic services such as health and education facilities .  
The eradication of poverty requires , inter alia , sound macroeconomic policies aimed at creating employment opportunities , equal and universal access to economic opportunities ( and special efforts to facilitate such access for the disadvantaged ) ; education and training that will promote sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen productive employment and work , and basic social services , including health facilities . 
An integrated approach to the provision of environmentally sound infrastructure in human settlements , particularly for the rural and urban poor , is an investment in sustainable human settlements development that can enhance the quality of life , reduce negative impacts on the environment , improve the overall health of a population , and reduce the burden of investment in curative health and poverty alleviation . 95 bis .  
Indeed , it has been pointed out that a major cause of the failure of sustainable forest management , and even of deforestation and transfer of forests to other land uses , is the inadequate recognition and underestimation of the values of the many goods and services provided by forests at the local , the national , the regional and global the level .  
This approach provides the necessary base for moving towards sustainable land-use systems within which forests are clearly recognized as an option with its own validity in contributing to sustainability at local , national and global levels . 
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and the secretariats of the regional commissions , as well as the principal financial and technical institutions and all other partners at the regional and global levels , should consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination in the fields of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The World Health Organization should be guided in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda by the global importance of health issues , the linkage of those issues to sustainable human settlements and adequate shelter , the close relationship between public health and basic urban and rural services , and the need to place human beings at the centre of development .  
We commit ourselves to the goal of improving living and working conditions on an equitable and sustainable basis , so that everyone will have adequate shelter that is healthy , safe , secure , accessible , and affordable and that includes basic services , facilities and amenities and the enjoyment of freedom from discrimination in housing and legal security of tenure .  
We commit ourselves to the goal of sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world by developing economies that will make efficient use of resources within the carrying capacity of ecosystems and by providing all people with equal opportunities for a healthy , safe and productive life in harmony with nature and their cultural heritage and spiritual and cultural values , thereby ensuring social progress .  
Stimulating national and local economies , through enabling competitive and sustainable economic development that will attract public and international financial resources and private investments , generate employment and increase revenues , providing a stronger financial base to support shelter and human settlements development ;  
The international community , including multilateral financial institutions , has an important role to play in providing additional resources to reinforce national efforts to foster an enabling environment so as to achieve the objectives of adequate shelter for all and the sustainable development of human settlements .  
The coordination of macroeconomic policies at all levels so as to achieve an international financial system that is conducive to stable and sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;

Assisting countries , particularly developing countries , in implementing effective and equitable pricing mechanisms for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements , infrastructure and services in order to induce greater flows of private , domestic and global funds , while ensuring transparent and targeted subsidies for people living in poverty ;  
The task of pursuing the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , in the face of increasing global economic interaction , necessitates international cooperation of public and private institutions operating in the areas of human settlement development , whereby resources , information and capacities are pooled for a more effective response to human settlements problems . 156 bis .  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reiterating the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources ,  
Welcomes , in pursuance of its resolution 49 / 22 A , the restructuring of the Special High-Level Council and the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Decade so that for the second half of the Decade they will provide the necessary support to global , regional and national policy and strategy development , public awareness-building and resource mobilization , and at the same time provide links with the scientific community and support the national committees for the Decade and national authorities in their cooperative efforts to integrate disaster reduction programmes into national activities for sustainable development ;  
Reaffirming that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and preparedness for natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by the Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
The most important challenges to continuous and sustainable development that humanity will face in the near future will be the provision of basic necessities , such as food , shelter , a clean and healthy environment and proper education , to the growing population of Earth .  
Because industrial and agricultural activities on the Earth 's environment have reached such a level that their effects are clearly observed on a global scale , continuous and sustainable development action and policies should be carried out for the protection and maintenance of Earth 's natural environment .  
In their observations and recommendations , which are presented below , the participants identified current situations and indicated the policies and action that should be supported by governments , national and international institutions and the scientific and technical communities to foster favourable conditions for the use of space technology in support of sustainable development .  
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy has the potential to become the largest single source of energy globally , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 if sustainability policies are adopted and technological advances achieved in the production of liquid , solid and gaseous fuels from biomass , based on the use of fast-growing species , soil-water species relationships , new harvesting and conversion techniques or the application of genetically engineered bacteria .  
In future , apart from expanding the resource base and developing major technological breakthroughs , the main challenge facing the world will be the necessity of examining lifestyles in all regions with the objective of matching supply and demand for energy in a stable and sustainable manner and implementing programmes to promote sustainability .  
In general terms , sustainable forest management deals with the administrative , economic , social , legal , technical and scientific aspects of the conservation and sustainable use of forests within the framework of technically sound and politically accepted national land-use plans . 
In operational terms , sustainable forest management includes the formulation and implementation of forest management plans , which help to control and regulate harvesting of specified goods , combined with silvicultural and protective measures applied in varying intensity to sustain or to enhance the social , ecological and economic value of subsequent generations of the managed forests .  
Environmentally sustainable forest management recognizes that forests simultaneously provide a wide range of socio-economic , environmental and cultural benefits , values and services at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The step-wise approach used in many of the ongoing initiatives in the development of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , includes early dialogue and regular reviews and refinement at technical and scientific level , complemented by subsequent policy level discussions and endorsement of principles developed .  
In these forums , special reference has been made to the need to expand activities to cover all kinds of forests , with a view to arriving at a complete global coverage of clearly defined criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management , applicable to countries in all geographic and ecological regions of the world .  
As stressed above , criteria and indicators defined at the national level are aimed at improving the quantity and quality of information available to decision makers and the general public about progress towards sustainable forest management , and thus to assist in the policy and decision-making process ; the ultimate aim in this regard is to further improve forest management practices over time .  
Research and methodologies to quantify indicators presently recorded as qualitative and descriptive ; and encouragement of objective monitoring of related national trends over time ; ( e ) Possibilities of forging closer links between action related to the ITTO " Target 2000 " with other ongoing international initiatives aimed at the definition of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management ;  
At its first session , the Panel re-emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms , as mutually agreed , and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
Fiscal regimes applied to natural resources have a long way to go in discouraging the excessive extraction and harvesting of natural resources and / or mobilizing substantial additional budgetary resources for sustainable development .  
Reaffirms that such a dialogue should be conducted in response to the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development as well as improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development , and that the United Nations should reinforce its activities in order to facilitate such a dialogue ;  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
Acknowledges that the administration of justice , including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and , especially , an independent judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in international human rights instruments , are essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable to democratization processes and sustainable development ;  
The Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Secretariat organized a meeting of the Expert Group on the Identification of Principles of International Law for Sustainable Development , within the framework established by the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development 5 / and Agenda 21 , to identify basic principles of international law for sustainable development , consider possible classifications of such principles , and assess their potential practical implications in a legal context , including their role in the interpretation and application of existing international law in the field .  
This is important for a number of reasons already specified , among which may be highlighted the need to advance understanding of what sustainable development means in relationship to international law and the importance of certain " benchmark principles " for guiding the drafting of national legislation , the interpretation of existing law and negotiations of future international law . 
The rapid growth in environmental regulation during the late 1980s and early 1990s , together with growing demands from customers , has encouraged business and industry to examine a range of strategies and techniques for moving towards more sustainable production and consumption .  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the least developed countries and to enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
They reaffirmed their commitment to work cooperatively towards achieving the prime objective of the Programme of Action which is to arrest the further deterioration in the socio-economic situation of the least developed countries , to reactivate and accelerate growth and development in these countries and , in the process , to set them on the path of economic growth and sustainable development based on shared responsibility and strengthened partnership .  
Redraft the beginning of paragraph 8.3 as follows : " The main objectives of the Department will be the promotion of an integrated approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of development , including the elaboration of perspectives that will provide for sustainable , equitable and participatory development .  
Recalling that the prime objective of the New Agenda is to stop and reverse the continuing deterioration in the socio-economic situation of African countries and to renew the commitment of the international community to support Africa 's own efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
The report drew from the deliberations of an Expert Group meeting of legal experts convened by the Division for Sustainable Development in the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Secretariat , in its capacity as task manager for chapter 39 , pursuant to the following objectives : to identify basic principles of international law for sustainable development , to consider possible classifications of such principles , and to assess their potential practical implications in a legal context , including their role in the interpretation and application of existing international law in the field . 
This effectiveness may be measured by a number of different factors , including the development of new instruments , mechanisms and standards so as to respond to need , as it arises ; the effective integration of environmental and developmental issues ; implementation , monitoring and compliance ; the participation of developing countries in negotiation , implementation , review and governance ; financial and technical assistance to developing countries ; dispute avoidance and settlement ; coordination and consistency among international legal instruments ; and the identification of new and emerging issues in the field of sustainable development .  
Chapter 39 calls for the provision to developing countries of technical assistance for the purpose of enhancing their national legislative capabilities in the field of environmental law ; it also states ( para . that technical and financial support should include assistance in building up expertise in international law particularly in relation to sustainable development .  
The Workshop was composed of qualified academic and governmental lawyers in their personal capacities , taking into account geographical representation ; and was based on the premise that , in moving towards sustainable development , international environmental law is inspiring new and innovative concepts , principles and ideas , and developing facilitative and enabling mechanisms and procedures in areas such as implementation and compliance and dispute avoidance and settlement .  
Capacity-development , like sustainable development , encompasses a wide range of aspects , including the human , technological , organizational , financial , scientific , cultural and institutional .  
A milestone in supporting the indigenous groups came with the release of the UNDP-sponsored study Conserving Indigenous Knowledge : Integrating Two Systems of Innovation . 2 / Coming to a workable consensus on respective roles and achieving productive partnership arrangements among these major groups remain two of the enduring challenges of capacity-building for sustainable development . 
The shift in emphasis from planning to strategy implementation of sustainable development has led practitioners to confront familiar institutional constraints - highly compartmentalized organizations in the public sector , difficulties in promoting more decentralization , the continuation of sectoral thinking and acting , lack of sufficient accountability and responsiveness , a shortage of financial and skilled human resources , poor salary and working conditions , and a lack of a performance culture in many development organizations .  
In this programme the United Nations University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa ( UNU / INRA ) addresses the continent 's urgent needs for human resources development and institutional capacity-building in order to achieve more effective conservation , management and rational utilization of natural resources for sustainable development .  
This programme consists of a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacities in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life .  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems ( including a new series on critical environmental regions ) .

Requests the Government of Burundi to continue its efforts geared towards the achievement of national reconciliation and the maintenance of lasting peace , inter alia , through adherence to the principles of the Convention on Governance , provisions that are essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of humanitarian aid and economic , financial , material and technical assistance to the people of Burundi ;  
Acting on the recommendation of the Tangier Declaration , the General Assembly adopted resolution 49 / 136 on public administration and development , in which it recognized the important role that Governments and public administrations can play in addressing new responsibilities arising from the pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , and also recognized the need for strengthened public administrative and financial management capacities in order to ensure a civil service that is responsive to the needs of the people .  
During the 1990s , dramatic political and economic shifts had been occurring throughout the world , marked by increasing tendencies towards democratization , greater reliance on market forces , greater emphasis on mobilizing domestic resources and reducing fiscal deficits , increasing privatization , growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes , and heightened recognition of the need to assure environmentally sound and sustainable development .  
Public administration will continue to fulfil critical functions in development , supporting measures for economic growth , protecting the environment , determining the relationship between the public and the private sector , reducing poverty and illiteracy and other social development activities , thereby achieving the goals of sustainable development .  
Commends the efforts of the Institute to address all levels of poverty that hamper so dramatically the advancement of women , through the coordination of research and training activities in the areas of economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; communications ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , sanitation and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different population groups , such as the girl child , older women , displaced women , refugee and migrant women and women in rural areas ;  
In spite of some encouraging individual examples of the growth of official development assistance ( ODA ) , as well as of some promising approaches towards mobilizing domestic and international resources for sustainable development identified and explored by the Commission through its Ad Hoc Inter-sessional Working Group on Finance , the overall picture in regard to the implementation of all the recommendations and commitments related to finance as contained in Agenda 21 remains an area of concern .  
Cooperation with the Division was included in the programme of action of the Agence for the years 1996 to 2000 with the objective , on a global level , of furthering democratic governance and sustainable development under the rule of law by the promotion of an independent , accessible and efficient judiciary .  
The multidisciplinary mission team consisted of 10 members and included a development economist , a mineral resources expert , an industrial economist , an environmental lawyer , a sustainable agriculture analyst , a fisheries adviser , a natural resources adviser , an institutional adviser , an education adviser and a people 's participation adviser .  
Using the vision of sustainable human development contained in the Five Goals of the National Constitution as the framework for its work , the mission analysed the major environment and development issues facing Papua New Guinea under the three broad headings of enabling government , managing Papua New Guinea 's resources and empowering people for effective participation and integral human development .  
In Viet Nam , a technical cooperation project was recently completed that assisted the Government in completing a new mining law , together with the implementation of regulations and a model mining agreement , and in establishing an administrative framework for the effective operation of the new legislation and the sustainable development of the mining sector .  
Directly tied into this process has been the continued dissemination of individual country information through the very successful investment seminars and round-table discussions which have enabled private companies , financial institutions and technical advisers to gain a better understanding of various countries and their risk factors , and to develop good working relationships with private and government officials and the multilateral and bilateral aid institutions , all with a view towards creating a sustainable economic and environmentally sound base of operations on which to build within the various countries .  
The host Government 's role should include the strengthening of social institutions to increase social equity ; achieving sustainable economic growth including extracting an appropriate " economic rent " through fiscal policy and / or direct royalty at the operational level ; and achieving environmental sustainability .  
The emphasis on artisanal mining is consistent with the objectives of the main international development funding organizations , such as the World Bank objective , stated at the round table , to alleviate poverty and improve living standards through sustainable growth and investment in people , and the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) objectives of poverty alleviation , environmental protection , job creation and promotion of the advancement of women .  
Cooperation with the Division was included in the programme of action of the Organization for the years 1996 to 2000 with the objective , on a global level , of furthering democratic governance and sustainable development under the rule of law through the promotion of an independent , accessible and efficient judiciary .  
These policy options will endeavour to link land and water management issues ; water for food security ; and safe drinking water supply , sanitation and sewerage and human health in the context of economic and social development .  NULLThe report will be supplemented by commissioned studies on the economic aspects of sustainable water resources development and use and gender issues , as well as a study on the relationship between water resources and growing urbanization and a study on cooperative approaches to the development of shared river basins .  
Invite UNCTAD and UNEP jointly , in cooperation with the secretariats of relevant MEAs , and taking into account the discussions by the Commission at its fourth session , to initiate an intergovernmental process aimed at developing comprehensive non-binding guidelines ( i.e . , incorporating legal , economic and development considerations ) to assist MEA negotiators in their consideration of the possible future use of trade and other measures in MEAs , with a view to promoting sustainable development as well as compatibility between trade and environmental policies .  
There were also concerns , however , that the new technologies would lead to growing social and economic gaps and injustice , and would threaten cultural diversity , religious values and even individual freedom ; there was therefore a need to study ways to make the new technologies widely accessible and supportive of sustainable development .  
Establish , fund and coordinate a sustainable network of accessible facilities and services for emergency and temporary residential accommodation for women and children , for example , " one-stop centres " , where all necessary assistance and services could be made available , including health care , crisis intervention , support , referral and counselling , in matters relating to the lodging of and follow-up to formal complaints , legal aid and court witness assistance , as well as personal protection , child care and earning a livelihood ;

Stressing the importance of an efficient and effective public sector as the basic framework for stable and sustainable institutional and human development in all countries ,  
Invites the international community to recognize the importance of the role of public administration and governance in sustainable human development and the maintenance of peace and stability , and to provide adequate resources for programmes of assistance for improving public administration in developing countries , countries with economies in transition and countries facing special circumstances ;  
Furthermore , Governments should , where feasible , promote the development of sustainable aquaculture as a means to increase food production and improve the economic basis for local community development , taking into account : ( a ) the need for assistance and transfer of technology and know-how to developing countries ; ( b ) the potential adverse impacts on the environment ; ( c ) the risks of introducing alien species ; and ( d ) the need for improved knowledge in the use of genetic engineering .  
The Working Group felt that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in June 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 could provide recommendations on the future role that the Commission should play as the focal point for formulating the consensus of States on strategies and priorities for action needed at the global level to promote the sustainable development and conservation of the marine environment . 
Stressing the importance of promoting regional and international cooperation for the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ,  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
Document good practices , innovative models and success stories with respect to assisting women in improving their living and working environment , to the adoption of sound environmental technologies and to women 's role in maintaining sustainable urban environments under conditions of globalization and rapid urbanization , and propose ways of assisting them in that role ( UNIFEM , UNEP / UNCHS , World Bank , UNDP , UNESCO , DPCSD ) .  
The objective of the initiative undertaken by the Netherlands and Switzerland is to facilitate dialogue and exchange experiences regarding national needs assessment as a supporting tool for the improved utilization of environmentally sound technologies in the transition towards sustainable development , in particular in developing countries and in countries in economic transition .  17 / 1996 / 1 .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace and interdependence of global , political , social and economic developments , and their implications for all countries , particularly the developing countries , and that there is a critical need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management to harness these challenges in support of sustainable development in all countries ,  
Recognizing that effectiveness of government requires an efficient and effective public administration in all countries that is responsive to the needs of the people , promotes social justice , ensures universal access to quality services and productive assets and creates an enabling environment for sustainable people-centred development ,  
Most ESCWA member countries have developed , or are developing , strategies or plans to combat environmental degradation and achieve sustainable development .  However , financial constraints and reduced public expenditure are apparently hindering the implementation of such strategies and plans .  
Both sides believe that it is necessary for the United Nations to formulate an Agenda for Development based on General Assembly resolutions and hope that the conclusion and adoption of the Agenda for Development will help the international community achieve the objective of sustainable development , contribute to the economic growth and social development of the developing countries and promote international cooperation and global development .  
Thus , within the new priorities related to sustainable urbanization and the environment , freshly mandated reports by decisions taken by the Commission on Human Settlements at its fourteenth session , were produced under subprogrammes related to global issues and strategies and the construction sector .  The above included reports on population , urbanization and quality of life ; strengthening of regional activities ; urban and housing indicators ; building materials and health ; and human settlements and environmental strategies .  
The overall objective of programme 3 , Outer space affairs , is to promote international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space by assisting and collaborating with Member States , in particular developing countries , organizations within the United Nations system , national and international space-related organizations and the private sector in the areas of space science and technology with emphasis on the application of space technology for sustainable development .  
To strengthen the capacity of Governments at the national and local levels as well as of the private sector to manage the rapidly growing demand for infrastructure and services in urban and rural settlements in an economically efficient and environmentally and socially sustainable manner ;  
To strengthen international cooperation in the development and implementation of human settlement policies striving towards environmental , economic and social soundness and sustainable development ; monitor and analyse results in the implementation process ; coordinate those policies with overall national sustainable development objectives ; and build institutional capacity and professional know-how ;  
To identify new and emerging trends in the ecological , economic , social , technical and legislative spheres that influence sustainable human settlements development in the ECE region ;  
While the reduction of posts was a factor in determining final output , the main consideration of the comprehensive review was to find a sustainable level of resources , taking into account the workload analysis for the period under review and bearing in mind the financial constraints faced by the Organization .  
In accordance with the " precautionary principle " , the Committee , in the draft resolution recommended for adoption by the Economic and Social Council , identified a number of concrete steps at the global level which could assist in the management of mineral resources and of environmental impacts during the period of transition to more sustainable consumption patterns .  
Noting that it is essential that strategies to move to sustainable consumption and production patterns of minerals be linked to strategies to maintain supply , and that the goal of ensuring optimal and efficient use of available resources with minimum environmental impact requires that the demand be met from the most efficient sources world wide ,  
This audience-oriented approach focuses on rural young men and women , the key players in a global programme aimed at ensuring increased agricultural production that conserves our natural resources to the greatest extent and sustainable rural development that reduces the push of rural poverty that exacerbates the current high levels of rural to urban migration in many of the developing countries .  
Strengthening international data collection and statistical systems to support countries in monitoring social development goals and encouraging the expansion of international databases to incorporate socially beneficial activities that are not included in available data , such as women 's unremunerated work and contributions to society , the informal economy and sustainable livelihoods ;  
The tasks identified by the Secretary-General included availability and management of water , sustainable food security , capacity - building for governance , social and human development and mobilization of external and internal financial resources for African development .  
The main focus of the subprogramme , which is implemented by the Department of Public Information , is to raise global awareness of Africa 's critical economic situation and of the actions taken by Africa and the international community to promote the economic recovery and sustainable development of the continent .  
We are referring to the desire of the peoples and States of the Commonwealth to make more effective use of their material and intellectual potential with a view to stimulating their economies , raising their standard of living and ensuring sustainable democratic development .  
The Board stated that the Institute 's programme of work should continue to focus on and establish priorities in areas where INSTRAW has already acquired expertise - areas such as the political and economic empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; natural resources and sustainable development ; water and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; access to credit ; women and the media ; and , issues relating to different population groups , especially the elderly and displaced , refugees and migrant women .  
The Acting Director noted that this limited the Institute 's ability to provide the other main committees of the General Assembly with substantive contributions and conclusions derived from its research in crucial areas of economic and social development , such as water , environment and sustainable development , waste management , renewable sources of energy , human settlements , alleviation of poverty , desertification , international migration , and violence against women migrant workers .  
The overall orientation of the programme , which is under the responsibility of the Department for Development Support and Management Services , is to enhance and support , through technical cooperation , the national efforts of Member States , in particular developing countries and the least developed among them , as well as economies in transition , to build their human and institutional capabilities and infrastructures to formulate and effectively implement economic and social policies that will contribute to sustainable , people-centred development and the eradication of poverty .  
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed as well as certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
We , the Heads of State or Government and the official delegations of countries assembled at the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) in Istanbul , Turkey from 3 to 14 June 1996 , take this opportunity to endorse the universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter for all and making human settlements safer , healthier and more livable , equitable , sustainable and productive .  
Our deliberations on the two major themes of the Conference - adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world - have been inspired by the Charter of the United Nations and are aimed at reaffirming existing and forging new partnerships for action at the international , national and local levels to improve our living environment .  
Recent United Nations world conferences , including , in particular , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , have given us a comprehensive agenda for the equitable attainment of peace , justice and democracy built on economic development , social development and environmental protection as interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
As we move into the twenty-first century , we offer a positive vision of sustainable human settlements , a sense of hope for our common future and an exhortation to join a truly worthwhile and engaging challenge , that of building together a world where everyone can live in a safe home with a promise of a decent life of dignity , good health , safety , happiness and hope .  
He also stressed that the establishment of an independent economy and sustainable economic development would necessarily require a diversified production base , free trade relations with Israel and the transformation from dependency on exporting the labour force to production and exports to foreign markets .  
The Commission also continued to study the distributive aspects of economic development , with special emphasis on analysing the effects of adjustment processes on income distribution ; public policies aimed at changing production patterns and promoting sustainable development and social equity , with an emphasis on assessing their effectiveness in those different spheres .  
In order to strengthen cooperation at the inter-agency level , ACC established in 1995-three ad hoc inter-agency task forces to provide integrated support for country-level action around three interrelated themes : ( a ) the enabling environment for social and economic development , with the World Bank serving as lead agency ; ( b ) employment and sustainable livelihoods , with the ILO as lead agency ; and ( c ) basic social services for all , with UNFPA as lead agency .  
Concerning agriculture , United Nations assistance will follow a multi-track approach aimed at strengthening the institutional capacity of the Palestinian Authority for agricultural development ; supporting sustainable natural resources management policies and practices ; revitalizing support services to agricultural entrepreneurs ; developing the sector 's human resources and encouraging the competitiveness of agricultural products ; and supporting the rehabilitation of essential rural physical infrastructures .  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environment protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , drug prevention , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , poverty eradication , and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
UNCTAD , in its field of competence and in collaboration with relevant regional and international organizations as well as non-governmental organizations , should be prepared to extend to island developing countries its technical cooperation capacity in respect of policies for sustainable economic development .  
ESCAP / POC currently has an advisory strength of nine advisers covering such diverse areas as economic and financial management , development and strategic planning , physical planning , sustainable development , social development , women in development , trade and investment , and ports and harbours development .  
To urge countries and international organizations to prepare in-depth strategic studies of forestry-specific ramifications of present consumption and production patterns in developing and developed countries , with special emphasis given to the positive and negative effects on the sustainable management and use of forests .  
In parallel with the required policy reforms for achieving sustainable forest management , the implementation of effective measures to address underlying causes of deforestation and forest degradation should be based on the results obtained from the application of a comprehensive diagnostic framework .  
This policy statement , intended as a contribution by the world 's farmers to the World Food Summit , emphasized that in order to increase food production while at the same time assuring sustainable relationships with the natural environment and maintaining stable rural societies , farmers acting through their own organizations needed to take a central role . 
Therefore , one can not find in the draft articles concepts such as water basin or integrated management . one can see sufficiently enshrined neither substantive principles such as sustainable development , precaution and preventive action nor their procedural corollaries : the requirement of environmental impact assessments , of transparency , of broadly informing and notifying the public and of consultation and negotiation on the impact of planned measures . 
In preparation for Kotka III , an attempt was made to match the information that had been collected at global level by FRA 90 and proposed for collection by FRA 2000 against the indicators of sustainable forest management identified by the ongoing international processes concerned with this subject .  
Promoting ways to expand and intensify activities in the identification of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , especially in the regions not yet involved in ongoing initiatives , including special ways and means to assist developing countries in which forests and woodlands are essential in meeting basic subsistence needs of rural populations and forest-dwelling peoples ;  
Ensuring common measurement and assessment standards and methods worldwide is part of the framework of the preparation of FRA 2000 , and some of the parameters to be assessed are directly related to indicators of sustainable forest management at the national level identified in the four main international processes .  
National capacities , especially in developing countries , must be urgently strengthened not only to implement sustainable forest management but also to collect and compile reliable data for monitoring the sustainability of forest management at the national level and to ensure that the information generated is relevant , scientifically sound and technically valid . 
If sustainable forest management as conceptualized at the international level is to be widely implemented at the national level on a lasting basis , international solidarity in the sharing of technologies , know-how and information and in making resources available to meet common needs must receive increased attention .  
The conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources should be integrated into national forest programmes ;  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems , including a new series on critical environmental regions .  
The activities of FAO in support of the economies in transition in central and eastern Europe and CIS concentrate on support for the implementation of economic and institutional reforms undertaken since the early 1990s as they involve and affect the agricultural and rural sector and , through assistance in approaching sustainable development , on support for the integration of the agriculture of these countries into the world economy .  
" Respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ( art . ) ;  
To urge developed countries and international organizations to support capacity-building activities for creating partnership agreements for sustainable forest management with indigenous people , forest dwellers and local communities ( including , for example , negotiation skills , understanding of the sustainable forest management agenda and outside interest in TFRK , legal support ) and mechanisms for compensating the real costs of participation ( forgone labour or social investments , as well as routine expenses ) .  
The proposed medium-term plan for the period 1998-2001 reflects the following priorities : maintenance of peace and security , promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ; development of Africa ; promotion of human rights ; effective response to humanitarian emergencies ; and promotion of justice and international law .  
The third session of the Commission and the first session of the Panel emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms as mutually agreed and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account the ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
The basic NFP principles recognize the following key elements ( see document E / CN . 17 / IPF / 1996 / 8 ) : national sovereignty ; integration with a country 's sustainable development strategy ; partnership ; participation ; a holistic and intersectoral approach ; a long-term iterative process ; capacity-building ; policy and institutional reforms ; consistency with national policy frameworks and global initiatives ; awareness-raising ; and harmony with national and international commitments .  
NFP links together strategic and operational planning and it is specifically designed to increase effectiveness and efficiency in sustainable forestry development at the country level , potentially leading to increased commitments by potential sources of both domestic and external funds .  
Proposed measures may include strengthening existing national research institutions , encouraging national research institutions to play a more active regional role and considering the feasibility of creating new international research institutions and networks dedicated to sustainable management and utilization of forests and forest policy research .  
It is desirable for the information systems to be Internet-based for this would allow easy access and information-sharing among multilateral agencies , countries ' institutions , non-governmental organizations and other interested parties .  The Panel may wish to invite relevant multilateral forest agencies and international organizations to review and initiate the development of improved information systems that support activities for sustainable forest management , particularly so as to facilitate private sector investment , speed up technology transfer to developing countries and improve coordination in financial assistance .  
To achieve an overview of the relevance of existing international legal instruments to the conservation , management and sustainable use of all types of forests and their relation to issues on the global forest agenda , the present report provides a comprehensive summary of multilateral instruments that are relevant to forest use and conservation .  
While they have evolved a holistic , traditional scientific knowledge of their land , natural resources and environment , their ability to practise sustainable development of their lands has been limited by economic , social and historical factors .  
The Panel recognized the importance of international cooperation for the management , conservation and sustainable development of forests , particularly in developing countries , in spite of the fact that it was each country 's responsibility to develop policies that would create an enabling environment for private , bilateral and multilateral investments in the forest sector .  
At the local level ( village or community level , district level ) , sustainable development entails many aims and objectives , such as eliminating poverty and raising living standards , increasing food production , improving the quality of human settlements , halting the spread of desertification , preventing deforestation , preserving biodiversity and managing existing forests .  
The goal of a national forest programme is to ensure the conservation , management and sustainable development of forests to meet local , national , regional and global needs and requirements , by fostering national and international partnerships for the benefit of present and future generations .  
Comprehensive national forest strategies that are consistent with and integrated into macroeconomic planning and policy and take into account the strategic value of forests as a capital base for national sustainable development need to be developed in order to facilitate mobilizing funds for sustainable forest development from various sources .  
Although Africa is faced with enormous problems , it also has a great potential , both in human and natural resources , for sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
The extent to which the scarcity of tropical hardwood resources may become a constraint on processing activities , as reflected in increased real prices for tropical logs and sawnwood , will depend on the willingness of major developing country producers to pursue sustainable management of remaining old-growth production forests and coordinate processing capacity with supply .  
Since it may be easier to negotiate and implement , country certification may not only lay the groundwork for more comprehensive international forest product certification agreements but also buy time , by initiating immediate incentives for action on sustainable forest management while the details of more complicated agreements on certification for all global forest products from natural and plantation forests are concluded .  
Finally , as will be discussed below , improved information on markets and revenues is required in order to assess the additional financial assistance that may be needed by low-income producer countries if they are to adopt sustainable forest management and the most efficient and equitable international mechanism for providing that assistance .  
The Council , in paragraph 2 of the resolution , " Commends the work of the Institute on the issue addressing the process of the economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , waste management and renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different groups , such as the elderly , displaced , refugees and migrant women " .  
Hope was expressed that a solution will be found as the World Bank and IMF continue their joint and ongoing efforts to bring the external debt problems of heavily indebted poor countries , including multilateral debt , to a sustainable level .  
At the ninth session of the Conference , member States decided that the main role of UNCTAD in the field of trade in goods and services should be to help maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , particularly the least developed countries and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , into the international trading system so as to promote their development .  
In Costa Rica , it has assisted in the promotion of a national policy for the training of local administrators , specifically in financial management , as well as facilitating the creation of a Metropolitan Council for the City of San Jos ; and has supported the " State of the Nation " initiative , consisting of a participatory scheme to produce an annual report of the country 's sustainable human development performance and its most significant challenges . 
Activities being initiated include reviewing the current state of interpreting modelling work for sustainable development ; formulating recommendations for improving existing integrated modelling work for sustainable development ; developing a linked set of models for integrated global and regional assessments of sustainable development ; stimulating the development and use of integrated models in developing countries ; and providing support to relevant activities of different bodies . 
The goal of the Plan is to bring a region-wide focus to ongoing and envisioned efforts of countries and external agencies to help achieve political , social and environmental stability and sustainable economic development in the entire Great Lakes region .  
Thus , it should improve and support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development , concentrating on the needs of the population and the eradication of poverty .  
The Administrative Committee on Coordination , at its October 1995 session , in order to ensure that the United Nations system effectively provides support for the integrated implementation at the country level of the action programmes that emerged from the World Summit for Social Development and other recent United Nations conferences , established inter-agency task forces , respectively , on basic social services for all , chaired by UNFPA ; employment and sustainable livelihoods , chaired by ILO ; and the enabling environment for economic and social development , chaired by the World Bank .  
Under the new initiative it would be determined after the initial three-year period whether Naples terms , together with comparable relief by non-Paris Club bilateral donors and commercial creditors , would be sufficient to put the country in a sustainable debt-service position .  
Accordingly , we not only commit our own efforts but also call on international , hemispheric and regional intergovernmental organizations to participate actively in organizing and following up the tasks to ensure that the summit on sustainable development to be held in Bolivia on 7 and 8 December 1996 is a historic occasion , laying the foundations of a hemispheric agenda for sustainable development that will be the core of national and international actions geared to meeting economic , social and environmental objectives .  
While the eradication strategy relied heavily on the use of insecticides to reduce or interrupt malaria transmission and attempted to eliminate infection through case detection and treatment , using the same approaches in all areas , the current strategy aims to control malaria disease through early diagnosis and prompt treatment , including improving the management of severe and complicated malaria , controlling epidemics and using preventive measures that are locally effective and sustainable .  
Having set out , in a number of principles and commitments , guidelines for making settlements healthier , safer , more humane and sustainable , the Habitat Agenda then proposes a comprehensive set of objectives and actions , based on two themes : ( a ) adequate shelter for all and ( b ) sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world .  
On the basis of an analysis of existing national plans , the broadest demand for technical assistance and cooperation in the follow-up to Habitat II is likely to be in institutional development , capacity-building and facilitation / enablement , with emphasis on the following components of effective governance for sustainable human settlements : legal frameworks and institutional structures , consultative and participatory processes , research and policy development , planning processes , management systems , financing modalities , training systems , information systems , communication networks , and technology transfer processes .  
The proposed project is also concerned with achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable social and human development ; reproductive health including family planning and sexual health ; and gender sensitivity and women 's empowerment .  
The situation of refugees , returnees and displaced persons in Africa has continued to be influenced by the harsh socio-economic realities of the continent and the related problems of the evolution of viable political institutions and processes based on democratic principles that will accommodate the diversity of cultures and the aspiration for peace , security and sustainable development .  
In its resolution 49 / 103 , the General Assembly urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the development agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable productive agriculture and food security in developing countries .  
The Assembly requested relevant organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and the multilateral financial institutions to strengthen their efforts to assist interested developing countries in the formulation and implementation of national water policies and strategies , and called upon the international community to give special attention to the revitalization of economic growth and sustainable development in developing countries , through , inter alia , a more diversified food and agriculture sector .  
It has established national committees in more than 80 countries , and through its regular meetings and special seminars has played a major role in the exchange of experience and technical information on the sustainable use and conservation of water in food production .  
Danish development policy is an integral part of Danish foreign policy , in which the main objectives are , inter alia : promotion of common security , promotion of democratic government and human rights , creation of economic and social development and ensuring ecologically sustainable development .  
Participants in the high-level segment recognized that , in future work , more attention should be paid to addressing the driving forces that impacted on the sustainable management of natural resources while at the same time giving more attention to the economic and social dimensions of sustainable development , including combating poverty .  
The Committee agreed that the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions and other relevant bodies , should actively contribute to making the special session a highly visible international event that would energize global commitment to the implementation of Agenda 21 and advance international dialogue and action for sustainable development .  
The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , at its fifth session , held from 21 to 31 May 1996 , was informed of the Institute 's efforts to promote regional technical cooperation and to coordinate activities in crime prevention , thus aiming at the promotion of sustainable development and respect for the rule of law by making criminal justice systems more effective in Africa .  
Considering the priority that African Governments are giving to achieve economic growth and sustainable development , considering also the challenge of growing criminality , both national and transnational , it is imperative that all measures that are being taken to achieve sustainable development are linked with crime prevention and criminal justice .  
Policy interactions and programme cooperation are also being expanded in the context of the arrangements made by ACC to promote the integrated follow-up to recent United Nations global conferences ( the World Bank chairs the thematic ACC task force on the enabling environment and participates actively , together with the International Monetary Fund , in two other inter-agency task forces on basic social services for all and on employment and sustainable livelihood ) , and of the System-wide Special Initiative on Africa .

The basic objective of the project is to contribute to the progressive elimination of opium cultivation by the Hmong ethnic group in a remote area through the introduction of sustainable social and economic development processes ;  
Those programmes were beginning to bear fruit : the level of absolute poverty had been reduced while per capita income had increased ; economic growth had been sustained ; the debt service ratio had decreased in relation to exports ; and the Philippines had re-entered the private capital market in order to seek sources of external financing .  27 .  In order to promote sustainable human development to achieve real prosperity , economic growth in developing countries must reach between 5 and 9 per cent .  
The World Food Summit was a fitting end to that series of conferences and a bridge into the future because it addressed the primary needs of all mankind and proposed solutions for food security and sustainable agricultural development at the global level . 
Although it acknowledged the critical role of national policies in that regard and the Organization 's efforts to raise awareness in the world community , it believed that sustainable development required a favourable international economic environment .  
Despite considerable efforts , the Commission had been unable to balance viewpoints and to catalyse decisive action by the international community , not only on financial resources but also on other cross-sectoral issues such as the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , economic instruments for sustainable development and the relation between international trade and the environment . 
The Commission on Sustainable Development , whose establishment had been one of the most important results of the Rio Conference , played a vital role in mobilizing a political commitment to safeguard the environment and was promoting sustainable consumption patterns , a particularly relevant issue in view of the threat to the environment posed by the culture of mass consumption fostered by the market mechanisms that were being introduced into the developing world .  
The Commission continued to alert the international community to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ; torture and enforced disappearance ; arbitrary detention ; violence against women , children and vulnerable groups ; the problem of internally displaced persons , extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , etc .  
It reaffirmed that democracy and transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society were indispensable foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development and that Governments in all countries should promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , bearing in mind the interdependent and mutually reinforcing relationship between democracy , development and respect for human rights , and should make public institutions more responsive to people 's needs .  
Requests the Secretary-General , in cooperation with the relevant organs and organizations of the United Nations system and in close cooperation with the Nicaraguan authorities , to continue to provide , within existing resources , all necessary assistance to activities for the reconstruction , stabilization and development of Nicaragua and to continue to ensure the timely , comprehensive , flexible and effective formulation and coordination of programmes of the United Nations system in Nicaragua , given the importance of those activities for the consolidation of peace , democracy and sustainable development ;  
The Secretary-General believed that priority should be given to such areas as the maintenance of international peace and security ; the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the developing world ; the promotion of development in Africa ; the protection of human rights ; more effective responses to humanitarian emergencies ; and the promotion of justice and international law .  
With reference to a participatory approach to sustainable human settlements through the development and support of strategies and mechanisms that encouraged open and inclusive dialogue among all interested parties , it was stressed that special attention needed to be paid to minorities .  
Recognize that increased use of solar energy can reduce environmental degradation caused by adverse human activities , such as industrial pollution and deforestation , and that it is the responsibility of Governments and all sectors of civil society to work together to find lasting solutions to problems threatening the sustainable development of humanity ;  
Are convinced that sustainable development and the utilization of solar energy would be enhanced by local and national capacity-building , policy reform and technology-sharing among nations , with an emphasis on coherent efforts towards technology acquisition and development in the developing countries . 
Acknowledging that there are links , under certain circumstances , between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments which request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Major initiatives in the economic management , public sector reform and decentralization area included the assistance to the completion of a comprehensive national Economic Management Capacity-Building Programme ( EMP ) , adopted by the Government in mid-1995 , one component of which is targeted at aid policy and coordination ; the associated Programme Support Document ( PSD ) , which also contemplates the formulation of a sustainable human development ( SHD ) strategy ( with UNICEF ) ; and the continued support to reconstruction and development planning at the provincial and district levels .  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
In order to assist , in particular , small and medium enterprises which had neither the resources nor the expertise required to reduce environmental pollution , strong support should be extended to the concept of environmentally sustainable industrial development and the Area-Wide Environmental Quality Management Plan developed by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment and its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
In this regard , the Government of Belarus would like to refer to the intention previously expressed by the United Nations Secretariat of reviewing and approving at a forthcoming meeting of the Quadripartite Committee for Coordination on Chernobyl the phases and modalities of action by the United Nations to encourage donors to extend generous and tangible assistance for the purpose of advancing medical and environmental projects and programmes capable of reviving the sustainable development of the three countries that suffered most as a result of the Chernobyl disaster .  
Expressing her delegation 's strong interest in pursuing durable solutions , she cited the innovative and comprehensive approaches developed by UNHCR for addressing population movements and said that voluntary repatriation should combine the elements of sustainable development , a community-based approach and a focus on returnee communities .  
The fundamental importance of the law of the sea institutions for international peace and security , the peaceful settlement of disputes , the sustainable development of marine resources and the protection of the environment has allowed them to evolve successfully , despite the increasing financial difficulties for Governments in providing for institutional development at the international level .  
Among other actions , the Subcommittee agreed that the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities would be considered as the cooperative programme framework for programme areas A ( integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ) and B ( i ) ( marine environmental protection : land-based sources ) .  
The topic touches not only on the protection and preservation of the marine environment , including that of the international seabed area , but also on such other matters as the application of the consent regime for marine scientific research , the regime for protected areas in the exclusive economic zone , the duties of conservation and management of the living resources of the high seas , and the sustainable development of living marine resources generally .  
SBSTTA has recommended that this expert group should concentrate on determining the following areas where the Biodiversity Convention can have the greatest effect : integrated marine and coastal area management , marine and coastal protected areas , sustainable use of coastal and marine living resources , mariculture and alien species . 193 Other items of particular note discussed by SBSTTA included the economic valuation of biological diversity and its components , in particular in relation to access to genetic resources ( art . 15 of the Convention ) .  
The recommendation was based on the following needs : " ( a ) to better identify priorities for action at the global level to promote conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment ; ( b ) for better coordination among the relevant United Nations organizations and intergovernmental financial institutions ; ( c ) to ensure sound scientific , environmental , economic and social advice on these issues . "  
Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
It therefore welcomed the set of measures outlined in subprogramme 5.4 ( Sustainable development ) which was intended to develop a comprehensive framework for the more effective integration of the social , economic and environmental aspects of sustainable development embracing the relevant sectoral and cross-sectoral components of Agenda 21 and incorporating the results of other major United Nations conferences held in recent years .  
India fully supported the need for global efforts to address the whole range of refugee-related problems , including their security and protection , international solidarity and burden-sharing , supporting the capacity of host States to receive and protect refugees , seeking sustainable solutions to refugee problems within countries of origin in order to prevent new exoduses , developing durable solutions and creating conditions for the repatriation of refugees in a manner that ensured their safety and their effective reintegration .  
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
Requests the Secretary-General , in cooperation with the relevant organs and organizations of the United Nations system and in close cooperation with the Nicaraguan authorities , to continue to provide , within existing resources , all necessary assistance to activities for the reconstruction , stabilization and development of Nicaragua and to continue to ensure the timely , comprehensive , flexible and effective formulation and coordination of programmes of the United Nations system in Nicaragua , given the importance of those activities for the consolidation of peace , democracy and sustainable development ;  
Reaffirms the need to encourage constructive dialogue and partnership based on mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development as well as improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development ;  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , which should be achieved through a once-and-for-all approach , can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Thus , it should improve and support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development , concentrating on the needs of the population and the eradication of poverty .  
In subprogramme 8.2 , on environment and social development management , it should be mentioned that the lack of financial and technological resources , information and technical knowledge and the debt crisis and unemployment are factors that have a negative impact on the environment and social development , as well as that eradication of poverty is of maximum importance for the developing countries and constitutes a basic condition for attaining sustainable development .  
Although the focus of the proposed programme on the three major themes of regional economic cooperation , environment and sustainable development , and poverty alleviation , is welcomed , there may be a need to sharpen the subprogramme elements further to better reflect desired activities in conformity with relevant legislative mandates , including the recently held United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) .  
The European Union is convinced that the role of the United Nations in the field of development activities would be substantially strengthened if the three secretariat departments with responsibilities in this area were to be merged under the authority of a single Under-Secretary-General responsible for policy formulation and coordination in the fields of sustainable development and economic cooperation , while coherence and coordination of operational activities should also be appropriately enhanced through the strengthening of the relevant secretariat function .  
Acknowledging that there are links , under certain circumstances , between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] / in which the national and regional strategy known as the alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
In the economic and social sectors , services of gratis personnel have been contributed by Governments and institutes to assist in carrying out work at Headquarters , primarily in areas where specific expertise was required to assist the Secretariat , for example , national accounts , research and analysis of the world economic and social situation , development of indicators of sustainable development and monitoring programmes of action and other international instruments in the economic and social sectors .  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
The experience of his country and others which had introduced basic economic reforms in tandem with systemic reforms confirmed that the successful pursuit of sustainable growth required that individuals be given the opportunity to be the active agents of change , that they must enjoy basic human rights and freedoms and that entrepreneurship should be encouraged .  
The purpose of the present report , which has been prepared in response to that request , is to provide an objective review and appraisal of the current conditions and trends in the exploitation and consumption of natural resources in human settlements , with a view to identifying imminent threats to sustainability , and to provide options for strategic interventions that could put current consumption patterns on to a sustainable track .  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
While Government and other stakeholders have been dedicating resources to the development of new financial instruments to address sustainable forestry , the huge shifts in global capital markets over the last five years suggest that the main issue for capturing private sector funding for forest management is not developing new financial instruments , but linking existing investment flows more directly to sustainability and with sustainable forest management in particular . 
In order to address these concerns and to reach the goal of economically efficient , socially balanced and ecologically sound sustainable forest management , the experts call upon the Governments , private sector and investment community , multilateral international organizations , non-governmental organizations and the voluntary sector to recognize their shared responsibility and to take urgent action as follows :  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Requests the Commission on Human Settlements to review at its sixteenth session , its working methods in order to involve in its work the representatives of local authorities or international associations of local authorities , as appropriate , and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector and non-governmental organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , taking into account the rules of procedure of the Commission on Human Settlements and the relevant provisions of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 31 ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Stresses the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Welcomes the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative endorsed by the Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund and the Development Committee of the World Bank , designed to enable eligible heavily indebted poor countries to achieve a sustainable debt situation through coordinated action by all creditors on the basis of adjustment efforts by the debtor countries necessary to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Bearing in mind that all countries , particularly the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , to narrow imbalances , and to cooperate with the developing countries so as to enhance their ability to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of money , finance , resource flows , trade , commodities and external indebtedness ,  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions , and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
He called on the secretariat to take into account , in all aspects of its work , the prevailing critical situation of those Latin American and Caribbean countries that had structurally weak and vulnerable economies , especially in the application of technical cooperation programmes , with a view to enabling governments to create an environment that was conducive to sustainable development and strengthening these countries ' capacity to participate fully in the international economy , trade and investment .  
The issues of the environment and development required a global rather than a selective approach ; for the developing countries , the eradication of poverty , together with economic and social development , remained the first priorities and should be an integral part of the strategy for sustainable development .  
In view of the enormous negative effects of natural disasters on the economic and social development of countries , national , regional and international programmes for sustainable development should always take into consideration activities for disaster prevention , preparedness and mitigation .  
In order to implement Agenda 21 in a satisfactory manner , it was imperative to create conditions for environmental protection and sustainable development at both the national and international levels and ensure compliance with common but differentiated responsibilities .  
Reaffirms the need to encourage constructive dialogue and partnership based on mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development as well as improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development ;  
Requests the Commission on Human Settlements to review at its sixteenth session , its working methods in order to involve in its work the representatives of local authorities or international associations of local authorities , as appropriate , and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector and non-governmental organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , taking into account the rules of procedure of the Commission on Human Settlements and the relevant provisions of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 31 of 25 July 1996 ;  
" Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
" Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , which should be achieved through a once-and-for-all approach , can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
" Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
The draft resolution before us on large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing , unauthorized fishing in zones under national jurisdiction and fisheries by-catch and discards draws attention to a number of damaging practices that continue to threaten a sustainable future for the world 's living marine resources .  
It proposes the establishment of a new oceanic order in the twenty-first century , as well as the joint management and scientific development of marine resources on an equitable and peaceful basis so as to maintain the ecological balance of oceans and achieve the sustainable development of marine resources .  It calls on States parties to the Convention to strengthen cooperation and establish joint management and development zones of marine resources .  
Regardless of the approach adopted by individual countries , NFPs or other relevant policy frameworks , as long-term iterative processes , should be based on [ guiding principles recognizing ] the following key elements : national sovereignty and country leadership ; consistency with national policies and international commitments ; integration with the country 's sustainable development strategies ; partnership and participation ; [ and ] holistic and intersectoral approaches that recognize forests as diverse ecosystems ; and secure land and property rights . 7 bis .  
The Panel also recognized the need for an external economic and commercial environment that is supportive of NFPs and , in particular , the need for these programmes to be supported by a market context that enhances the economic value of forest resources and ensures adequate and remunerative prices with respect to the sustainable use of those resources . 
Encouraged national authorities to consider the need to enhance capacities in all relevant sectors , including [ public , private ] [ the public and private sectors , indigenous peoples , local communities ] and non-governmental sectors , [ effectively and in a coordinated manner , ] taking into account the role played by each of the interested parties in the [ sustainable development ] [ management , conservation and sustainable development of all types ] of forests , in order to achieve country-led design and implementation of NFPs .  
It [ is only possible ] [ may be helpful ] to decide whether changes in forest cover are [ or are not harmful against ] [ beneficial or not by considering ] a background represented by a national policy framework for [ sustainable forest management ] [ the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests ] that encompasses and harmonizes elements pertaining to social and economic development programmes , environment plans , land-use plans , and national biodiversity strategies and action plans .  
The Panel recommended that indigenous people , forest owners , forest dwellers and local communities should be enabled to play a [ key ] role in [ defining ] participatory [ approaches to forest and land-use management ] [ approaches to sustainable forest management and land-use planning ] [ with the involvement of ] [ together with ] all interested relevant parties from both public and private sectors , and with greater focus on resource management , land-use systems and conflict resolution . 
[ Urged ] [ ( iv ) Urging ] Governments to promote digital mapping ( using geographical information systems ( GIS ) and global positioning systems ( GPS ) combined with social mapping for establishing forest holdings and values ; assisting planning and management partnerships ; and assisting in the [ location of cultural and ] [ storage of ] geographical information required to support [ sustainable forest management schemes ; ] [ the management , protection and use of TFRK ] ;  
The Panel recognized that in developing countries domestic resources for the financing , management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forest are scarce and international financial sources remain vital .  
The Panel emphasized that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is an [ essential ] [ important ] basis for sustainable forest management , and for a wide range of considerations related to forests [ and forest ecosystems ] at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests such as fuelwood , [ the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of benefits of ] biological diversity , soil and water conservation protection functions , carbon sequestration and other social , cultural and economic aspects are rarely covered and will need more attention .  
These should fully recognize the ecological , social , cultural and [ religious ] [ spiritual ] values of forests [ and pay particular attention to global dimensions of climate change and the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of the benefits of biological diversity . ]  
Developing countries which have only recently joined such processes , or which are about to join , should , as appropriate , be assisted through action aimed at poverty alleviation ; institutional strengthening ; human resource development , with special consideration to gender issues and to education and training at all levels ; establishment of mechanisms for increased public participation ; research and technology transfer ; research networking ; ensuring access to , and dissemination and exchange of , information ; development of plans and programmes ; and field-level testing of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management ;  
The Panel recognized that the [ agreements reached ] [ documents adopted ] at UNCED have significantly [ underlined ] [ increased ] the understanding that forest policy and sustainable forest management must be [ reconciled ] [ addressed ] , taking into account the multiple benefits of forests [ at the national , regional and global levels ] and that these issues need to be addressed through a holistic and integrated approach [ rather than in a fragmented manner ] .  
The Panel underscored the need for international institutions to support national , [ subregional ] [ subnational ] , regional and international action towards sustainable forest management , [ building a consensus on approaches [ and standards ] worldwide and improving the conditions for adequate capacity-building and financing ] [ to build consensus on approaches and better coordinate their international cooperation efforts ] for [ sustainable forest management ] [ the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests ] .  
At the same time , the Panel acknowledged that at present no single multilateral body , organization or instrument has either a mandate or the capacity to address , in a balanced , [ integrated ] [ holistic ] and mutually reinforcing way , all forest-related issues currently on the international agenda on sustainable forest management .  
The Panel agreed that [ existing or any future body of ] [ any future ] international forest-related legal mechanism [ s ] must deal cohesively with all the interrelated social , economic , trade , environment , development , production , financial and technology issues and have a concrete impact on the future successful implementation of [ sustainable forest management ] [ management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests ] worldwide .  
In recognition of the interdependence and mutually reinforcing nature of democracy , development and human rights , human rights education under the Decade shall seek to further effective democratic participation in the political , economic , social and cultural spheres , and shall be utilized as a means of promoting economic and social progress and people-centred sustainable development .  
M'MELLA ( Kenya ) said that , in view of his Government 's belief that the integration of environmental policies into national development strategies was an essential component for sustainable socio-economic and human development , it had ratified all the three major conventions that had been prepared pursuant to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
The understanding of the relationship between the environment and sustainable development , coupled with the call by the Rio Conference for an authentic , durable and widespread change of habits and attitudes , especially in industrialized countries , would create a pattern for development that was not only environmentally and socially sustainable , but also equitably distributed with the human person as its central focus .  
Topics that should be included in the discussions of the special session of the General Assembly included : international cooperation in the area of finance and technology ; consideration of the crucial role of the private sector with a view to proposing initiatives for stimulating private investment in sustainable development projects ; relationship between production and energy consumption and the interaction between energy and atmosphere ; international discussions on forests ; the challenge of urbanization ; and the strengthened role of the Commission on Sustainable Development as a political forum .  
In conclusion , the FAO report entitled " World Agriculture : Towards 2010 " addressed many issues related to Agenda 21 , in particular the technical and environmental challenges to sustainable agricultural development and the potential for future agricultural growth ; studies of technology reviews ; the natural resource base ; prevailing agricultural policies ; trade liberalization ; the trade-offs between the environment and agricultural development ; and implications for the future .  
His delegation was also encouraged by regional activities designed to implement Agenda 21 and by the fact that , at the national level , approximately 100 countries had reformed their institutional structures with a view to achieving sustainable development .  
A wide programme of eradication of coca plants , poppies and marijuana crops continued to be carried out , and continued efforts were being made to obtain additional resources through international cooperation to complement those already invested in the country 's alternative development programme , which constituted an economically sustainable solution for peasant and indigenous families , and a long-term solution for elimination of the illicit supply of drugs .  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] in which the national and regional strategy known as the alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
Also emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are indispensable foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and takes note with appreciation of the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 , [ 4 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Thus , it should support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development .  
" Decides that the priorities for the biennium 1998-1999 are the following : maintenance of international peace and security ; promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and recent United Nations conferences ; development of Africa ; promotion of human rights ; effective coordination of humanitarian assistance efforts ; promotion of justice and international law ; disarmament ; drug control , crime prevention , as well as combating international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations ; "  
The reality is that no State can long remain just or free , and thus also have the potential to pursue a successful and sustainable development strategy , if its citizens are prohibited from participating actively and substantially in its political processes and economic , social and cultural development .  
Yet vigorous and effective local governance is essential not only to global problem-solving : by contributing to health and sustainable human settlements , it is also essential to international peace and security in the broadest sense .  
The same can be said of the pioneering efforts under way towards linking international organizations , both governmental and non-governmental , with national and private multinational banks in order to provide the funds and services which small and medium-sized entrepreneurs in transitional and developing countries require for sustainable development activities .  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the Urban and Housing Indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in the civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , i.e . , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
Sweden has identified eight policy areas which represent the most fundamental and important challenges that have to be addressed effectively in the short and medium term in the country to ensure adequate shelter for all and the sustainable development of Swedish human settlements .  
Thus , it should support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people centred sustainable development .  
Although there is no universal prescription for successful development , a consensus has emerged , inter alia , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework of our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
From these conferences , a consensus has emerged on a multidimensional , comprehensive and integrated approach to development which recognizes , among others , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
When we met during the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held only four months ago , we all expressed our deep concern that , compared to 1992 , the overall trend regarding sustainable development in developing countries is worse today .  
The paradigm of sustainable development , based on economic growth that is sustained , socially equitable and ecologically viable , constitutes the common denominator on which the international community now agrees in order to give new direction to the collective search for the economic and social well-being of our peoples .  
As Mali sees it , any work towards sustainable development is above all a national responsibility , through the effective definition and application of sound macroeconomic policies , based on transparency , the pre-eminent rule of law , the practice of democracy , respect for human rights , social justice , and the participation of all in the effort of national development .  
These conferences provided a starting point for a global effort in advancing sustainable development , set goals and defined broad plans of action that provided the basis on which national and international actions could proceed .  
Today it is universally accepted that sustainable development could be attained if it were approached in a comprehensive manner , and that sustained economic growth is closely linked with social development and environmental protection .  
Indeed , increased cooperation between the two organizations will , we hope , make it possible to establish the foundations for international cooperation that is free from ideological confrontation and resolutely determined to meet its global challenges : economic and social development ; strengthening democracy and respect for human rights ; the promotion of sustainable development while taking account of the need for environmental conservation ; the struggle against the scourge of drugs ; and the promotion of gender equality .  
The struggle of developing countries to eradicate poverty , achieve economic and social progress and attain conditions of sustained economic growth and sustainable development has as a prerequisite sine qua non the establishment of a more propitious and dynamic economic environment .  
Two years ago , during the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , we committed ourselves not only to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , but also to rededicate our efforts to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness for our universal Organization , with a view to enabling it to play a pivotal role in promoting sustainable development , particularly in the developing countries .  
It is our earnest desire to take maximum advantage of the rich potential of our natural resources and to use them in a sustainable and balanced manner with a view to creating wealth and a better future for our people .  
The agenda of that meeting attests to the interest of both organizations in such international and regional questions as the political question of the maintenance of international peace and security or humanitarian questions such as mine clearance , as well as other questions dealing with economic and social cooperation , sustainable development , the environment , combating drugs , crime prevention , agricultural and rural development , family planning , population and health .  
I believe it is time that we members of the Conference began to assert the strength of our numbers and potential influence and aired our collective opinions on the vital issues of the day , such as in the realm of global peace and security , environmental protection and conservation , sustainable development , human rights and overall economic and social development . 
Following the peaceful changes that took place in Benin after the National Conference of Active Forces of the Nation in February 1990 , the people of Benin have been experiencing an era of democratic renewal based , inter alia , on the building of the rule of law , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development through its three component factors economic , social and environmental .  
Governance is effective only where three key elements the State , the private sector and civil society function in partnership in creating the political , economic and social conditions which are conducive to ensuring sustainable human development .  
The objective of sustainable development should be the integration of environmental , economic and social policies in order to meet basic human needs and to manage the environment on a sustainable basis .  
The main objective of this doctrine is the gradual realization of a global civil society , a society where liberty and salvation harmoniously coincide to meet the spiritual and material needs of humanity in an institutionalized manner , and where comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development lies at the foundation of universal cooperation and participation .  
In our view , we can move towards the gradual realization of a global civil society through institutionalization of these two fundamental principles and by committing ourselves to pluralism , tolerance , dialogue among civilizations , promotion of human rights , comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development , justice and equality of opportunities as the governing norms in our interactions .  
Expansion and broadening of the participatory base of the future global order on the basis of norms acceptable to all cultures and peoples is most conducive to building a better tomorrow , and to ensuring freedom , security , stability and sustainable development at the national , regional and international levels .  
Only a reformed and revitalized United Nations can create the foundation for a global partnership between developing countries , developed countries and multilateral organizations , with the prime objective of achieving sustained and sustainable development .  
It is relevant here to highlight the need for the international community to continue its cooperation with the Central American countries by providing the required economic , financial and technical assistance in sustained fashion and on favourable terms in order to make the goals of the programme of sustainable development in Central America achievable .  
Emphasizes the importance of supporting and strengthening the new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities laid down in the new sustainable development programme for the region .  
Landmines exact a high human , social , economic and environmental cost and make it difficult to create the conditions needed for sustainable development in afflicted regions .  
But the main specific feature is that all these Republics are in the process of building a State , and therefore give the highest priority to the issues of peace , security and stability in their domestic and foreign policies , because only with these basic conditions is sustainable economic and social development possible .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in the industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful in their development processes .  
You have moved forward in several areas , such as the management of forests and fresh water , in the commitment to discuss energy and transport from the perspective of sustainable development and in more specific actions , such as the phasing out of leaded gasoline and the ambitious work programme you have set for the Commission on Sustainable Development .  
Let the message go back to the various capitals , to non-governmental organizations and to all stakeholders that the achievement of sustainable development requires nothing less than action that integrates economic , environmental and social components into decision-making and programmes , and the resurgence of a true global partnership based on common but differentiated responsibilities .  
I wish to express our appreciation to all of the nations and international agencies that are supporting us technically and financially in order to reverse the consequences of the conflict that ravaged El Salvador , and we invite the international community to accompany us in our transition towards sustainable development with timely and flexible assistance . 
Future international action should address the oceans , particularly the sustainable use of marine resources through improved environmental approaches to marine ecology ; the protection and sustainable use of fresh water and wetland habitats , particularly in arid regions ; the protection and sustainable use of forests and woodlands ; and the problems of hazardous chemicals .  
Mr . Afful ( Ghana ) : Five years ago we met in Rio de Janeiro to elaborate integrated strategies aimed at achieving two major goals : first , to halt and reverse the negative impact of human behaviour on the physical environment , and secondly , to promote sustainable economic development in all countries .  
The concept of sustainable development as a mean between the imperatives of development and the protection and conservation of the physical environment , including our natural resources , calls for the promotion of an international economic environment that is conducive to and supportive of the development efforts of all countries , particularly those of the developing world , many of which are still grappling with the provision of basic social services for their populations .  
A policy that is geared towards a sustainable development model is conceivable and feasible only through international political intervention an intervention that implies a spirit of cooperation and solidarity among the industrialized countries , the developing countries and the poorest parts of the world . 
If sustainable development is as no one can doubt , if only by dint of the precautionary principle the essential purpose of international policy , it is important to envisage a method of ensuring that there is an open and responsible participatory implementation among all nations and at the national level .  
The United Nations system has a key role to play in dealing with the development migration nexus by addressing the root causes of migration ; strengthening national , regional and global efforts to achieve sustainable development ; and supporting efforts to ensure orderly migration while promoting and protecting the human rights of migrants .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
This initiative now offers the possibility of a significant and sustainable resource base for addressing many toxic chemical issues at the global , regional , and national level .  
While there has been an increased recognition of the importance of science and a considerable increase in international planning and coordination to provide the scientific basis for sustainable development , the actual amount of money being spent on scientific activities in a majority of both developing and developed countries has declined since 1992 .  
Scientific illiteracy remains a major impediment in developed and developing countries alike for a better understanding of environment and sustainable development problems and for ensuring a full participation of the public at large in finding and supporting solutions to these problems .  
A number of important initiatives have been launched to develop high-level scientific capacities in developing countries ( with particular reference to the least developed countries ) so as to enable these countries to address local problems and to participate fully in regional and international activities related to important issues such as sustainable water and coastal zone management , global change and the conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity .  
Without genuine political will on the part of the international community , expressed in the form of cooperative arrangements , through , for example , the United Nations system and its various organizations , these most basic gaps will persist , seriously compromising efforts to move towards sustainable development .  
Where Stockholm adopted an issue-oriented approach to pollution and non-renewable resource depletion , Rio emphasized integrated strategies to promote human development through economic growth based on sustainable management of the natural resource base .  
A partnership for development should be forged in which developed and developing countries would undertake , in a framework of growing interdependence and joint responsibility , to establish sensible national policies and an international climate conducive to sustainable and accelerated development .  
What is lacking is the development of the social and institutional structures that are needed to keep pace with the policy , regulatory and service demands arising from rapid population growth , increased complexity and the changes in technology ; and underlying this gap is the issue of good governance and its impact on building capacities and developing performance standards for sustainable development . 
Very often , large-scale and sudden movements into areas of already declining environmental and socio-economic conditions lead to a reduction in migrants ' well-being ; damage to the natural resource base on which the local economy depends ; economic and political difficulties for the host areas ; and erosion of efforts made by Governments and the international community to support sustainable development in both areas of origin and host areas .  
Human settlements should therefore be at the centre of concern for sustainable development , as they are essential for social and economic progress and , in an increasingly interdependent world , critical for the well-being of both urban and rural populations ( see box 1 ) .  
As a direct consequence of recommendations of the Commission on Sustainable Development and the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development ( IACSD ) in 1994 , more than a dozen multilateral and bilateral assistance agencies began discussions leading to the formation of the " Urban Forum " , to serve as a vehicle for information exchange , and joint programming in the field of sustainable human settlements development .  
On another level , the Habitat Agenda also provides clear and detailed expression of the local environmental agenda and priorities of developing countries , which are focused on essential services , such as water supply , sanitation and waste management , among others , and are informed by the relationship between poverty and environmental decline , and thus by the need for sustainable economic growth to address both issues .  
The current approach to energy policy worldwide , which is characterized by a strong emphasis on energy supply , without regard to its social , economic and environmental consequences , does not meet the requirements of sustainable development .  
The current pace of growth in world energy demand , even with a strong emphasis on efficiency , is expected to lead to a substantial increase in aggregate commercial energy demand - under 2 per cent per year between 1995 and 2020.4 The potential consequences of this scenario are profound , if the growth in energy demand is not met in a sustainable manner .  
Subsidies in the energy sector for conventional energy sources and nuclear power tend to hamper widespread development and application of renewable energy sources . 6 Policy changes that will lead to the full internalization of environmental costs in prices through the use of economic and fiscal instruments and the removal of permanent subsidies are required if a sustainable energy path is to be pursued . 
Since the late 1980s , interest in new and renewable sources of energy has begun to surge again , given the emerging concern about the environmental impacts of the growing use of fossil fuels , including their contribution to the emission of greenhouse gases , and general awareness of the need for sustainable energy systems .  
The main objective of chapter 26 is to establish full partnerships between Governments , international organizations and indigenous people . 14 Proposals to achieve the main objective include establishing processes that empower indigenous people ; strengthening the active participation of indigenous people in the formulation of national policies related to resource management ; and involving indigenous people at the national and local levels in programmes related to sustainable development .  
If local action is the basis of sustainable development , future decisions on political and economic resource allocation at the national level will need to give priority to supporting local authorities .  
Several targets are put forward , including promoting the ratification of ILO conventions ; establishing bipartite and tripartite mechanisms on safety , health and sustainable development ; increasing the number of environmental collective agreements ; reducing occupational accidents and injuries ; and increasing workers ' education and training efforts by the year 2000 . 
Although there are numerous examples of good practices by business and industry , the number of companies that are making strides in becoming sustainable development enterprises is small relative to the global total , a disappointing trend given that business and industry is the single most dominant factor influencing the direction of investments and financial flows , as well as the type of products produced and the processes with which they are made . 
Actions that are based on partnership and the involvement of major groups open up a wider political space for a broad list of social and economic actors , which puts the sustainable development challenge in the hands of not only Governments and United Nations bodies but also and equally of local communities , individuals , professional societies , businesses of all sizes and the various organizations of civil society at all levels .  
Further discussions focusing on the major group concept in informal settings , such as inter-sessional workshops or seminars , may help to develop a better understanding of the concept and how it can be further operationalized in the context of local , national , regional and international institutions working on sustainable development .  
The response of individual organizations of the United Nations system to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 's sustainable development agenda is assessed in terms of the three basic functions of intergovernmental organizations : ( a ) policy development , ( b ) the collection , synthesis , analysis and dissemination of data and information to inform action at all levels and ( c ) the delivery of technical and financial support to strengthen human and institutional capabilities at national and regional levels .  
The role and priorities of UNEP , as reflected in its organizational structure and its successive biennial work programmes since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , indicate a fundamental shift , largely in reaction to Agenda 21 and based on a clear assessment of needs , from a sectoral approach in respect of the environment to a fully integrated strategy , that is responsive to the agenda for sustainable development .  
In other cases , the existing policies and priorities of the agencies emphasized the social , economic , environmental and cultural dimensions underlying sustainable development to a sufficient extent so that new structures were not felt to be necessary .  
It was envisaged that implementation of Agenda 21 would require active involvement of all relevant international institutions , both within and outside the United Nations system , that are dealing with specific economic , social or environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
Affirmation of the economic , social , environmental and cultural principles inherent in the concept of sustainable development would be enhanced by more systematic consideration of the follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and related major United Nations conferences .  
Given the increased number of decision-making bodies concerned with sustainable development , including those related to the international conventions , there is an ever-greater need for coordination at the intergovernmental level through consistent and coherent positions of Governments in these various forums , as well as for the development and strengthening of a collaborative process among secretariats .  
The collective view of the secretariats of the organizations of the United Nations system is that the concept of sustainable development should continue to provide an " overarching " policy framework for the entire spectrum of United Nations activities in the economic , social and environmental fields at global , regional and national levels .  
These negotiations will have special importance for the future work of the GEF , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national level .  
This programme consists of a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacity in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life .  
As reported in document A / 51 / 506 , draft guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national Plans of Action for human rights education .  
There are numerous regional and global treaties supporting an approach which integrates environment and development , such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Desertification Convention . 23 Paragraph 6 of the 1995 Copenhagen Declaration provides that " . . . economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people " . 
Their declaration recognized that public-private partnerships not only foster sustainable cities , but also generate profitable opportunities for business through increased productivity , a better educated and dynamic work force and improved infrastructure .  
Recognizing the importance of clean and safe energy technologies in the pursuit of sustainable development , the Council , in the same resolution , recommended that the Commission 's secretariat , in consultation with the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development and other relevant international bodies , submit to the Commission at its third session an issues note that should identify scientific and technological aspects of sustainable energy systems that might be considered by the Commission in defining its future work programme .  
It should be noted that , for the purposes of the present exercise , all official development finance committed for development assistance is assumed to be dedicated to sustainable development , so that analysis focuses on any changes in the allocation of financial assistance among the economic , social and environmental components of sustainable development that may have been made in response to the series of global conferences beginning with the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and other determinants of aid composition .  
The objectives of the work programme are , first , to promote the positive effects and mitigate the negative impacts of agricultural practices on biological diversity in agro-ecosystems and their interface with other ecosystems ; second , to promote the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources of actual or potential value for food and agriculture ; and third , to promote the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources .  
In particular , Parties have through the CBD been actively pursuing a strategy of establishing the legal basis to ensure the integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ( programme area A ) and sustainable use and conservation of marine living resources under national jurisdiction ( programme area D ) .  
Following the momentum set at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , but going even further , the CBD as a process is open to " participants " and is not confined to Governments . 21 The Convention 's rules of procedure define participants in a broad manner which essentially encompasses all of the major groups identified in section III of Agenda 21 , so long as they can demonstrate that they are qualified in fields relating to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity . 
Other areas of cooperation under investigation between the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Secretariat and the CBD include the development of indicators for measuring the status of relevant environmental factors and the effectiveness of measures taken by both processes within the United Nations system-wide effort towards the development of sustainable development indicators .  54 .  Cooperation between the CBD and the United Nations has not been restricted to the administrative level , but has also included the legislative or policy-making bodies of both processes .  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Bearing in mind that all countries , particularly the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , to narrow imbalances , and to cooperate with the developing countries so as to enhance their ability to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of money , finance , resource flows , trade , commodities and external indebtedness ,  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
Emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are indispensable foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and takes note with appreciation of the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 , [ 4 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Gender mainstreaming in such substantive areas as economic and social matters , peace and security , human rights , sustainable development and humanitarian affairs requires an institutional culture that is conducive to such mainstreaming .  
In parallel , measures might be designed to ensure that the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , attaches priority to coordinating sustainable development cooperation programmes and investments that directly or indirectly support alternative development initiatives , and that Member States act in a coordinated manner in the governing bodies of all relevant parts of the system .  
The SRRP has already funded and implemented hundreds of local initiatives which have sustainable impact in improving the access to basic social services , improving the productive potential of rural communities and establishing sustainable income-generation opportunities for rural populations .  
To make sustainable human development ( SHD ) a reality in this new context , a more integrated approach is required , one that allows economic growth , social equity and environmental sustainability to move forward together .  
Activities include encouraging countries to create a conducive legal and regulatory climate for sustainable energy development ; supporting and financing innovative demonstration projects that promote key technologies ; and supporting the formulation and implementation of national energy action programmes .  
It serves as an expert facility and repository of technical information relating to the sustainable development of small hydropower operations as a viable and environmentally friendly alternative source of energy , particularly in rural areas of developing countries .  
Addressing the general concern that support for Africa is on the wane at a time when countries are making tremendous efforts to lay the groundwork for sustainable economic growth , the Secretary-General of the United Nations launched , on 15 March 1996 , the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on Africa , involving an unprecedented set of coordinated actions designed to maximize support for African development efforts through the combined resources of the United Nations system . 
The Commission recognized that particular attention should be focused on the holistic approach towards environmental and developmental functions of forests ; sustainable forest management ; conservation of biological diversity ; conservation of soil and water resources ; restoration ; forest products and services ; and participation of major groups , particularly indigenous people and local communities .  
Regardless of the approach adopted by individual countries , national forest programmes should be viewed as long-term iterative processes , and should be based on guiding principles recognizing the following key elements : national sovereignty and country leadership , consistency with national policies and international commitments , integration with the country 's sustainable development strategies , partnership and participation , and holistic and intersectoral approaches .  
The general basis for securing sustainable development is the presence of adequate institutions , knowledge , skills and access to technology and financial resources , which will need to converge in the design and demonstration of sustainable - that is , responsible in a long-term perspective - ways of managing the environment , producing goods and services , meeting basic needs , and improving the economic and social standards of living for the world as a whole , especially for the poorest communities . 
After briefly reviewing the achievements of UNCED and continuing impediments to sustainable development , the present report identifies a way forward that includes fiscally responsible government actions , more effective economic incentives , improvement in the enabling conditions for change , and other market-oriented policies designed to optimize sustainable development in the areas of energy , water and transportation , while building in a concern for social equity .  
Despite the concomitant increase in private capital flows , which have been concentrated in a relatively few countries , ODA remains an essential element for sustainable development , especially in least developed and other vulnerable countries , and the commitments for new and additional resources should therefore be met .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , including a focus on the local environment in the context of sustainable development .  
The process of urbanization facilitates sustainable development by giving more people access to productive and sustainable technologies and reducing pressure on ecologically fragile areas ; but it poses enormous problems for urban planning and management , which must meet the growing demand for energy , water and transportation , while coping with increasing volumes of solid , liquid and gaseous wastes .  
That new capital is envisaged to come from a redirection of private capital from mature markets to markets with new absorptive capacity created for sustainable development ; from the removal of existing subsidies ; from domestic savings ; from debt-relief ; and from public monies , including increased ODA . Efforts should be made to provide the necessary flexibility to allow those reallocations to take place naturally in response to incentives . 
There is an urgent need to strengthen democratic and participatory processes for planning and implementing sustainable development so as to involve all concerned social groups at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
There is an urgent need to increase economic incentives for sustainable development based on full and comprehensive pricing that reflects all economic , social and environmental externalities , with targeted and explicit subsidies , where necessary , to prevent social dislocations and hardships for the disadvantaged .  
It agreed that the term " national forest programme " is a generic term for a wide range of approaches to sustainable forest management within different countries , to be applied at national and subnational levels based on the basic principles outlined below .  
It noted the statement annexed to decision II / 9 of the Conference of the Parties to that Convention , and accepted that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from research and development and from the commercial utilization of biological resources fell , inter alia , within the purview of the Convention .  
While recognizing that forest land rehabilitation would be required in many areas and that that would need international assistance , including financial resources and technology transfer to support local and national efforts , the Panel emphasized the need for prevention , rather than mitigation and restoration , wherever practicable , with emphasis on improved and sustainable management of existing natural forest and other vegetation .  
The Panel recognized that in developing countries , domestic resources for financing the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forest are scarce and international financial sources remain vital .  
Assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is central to sustainable forest management and to a wide range of other considerations related to forests and forest ecosystems at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests , such as fuelwood , the sustainable use and conservation and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits of biological diversity , soil and water protection functions , and carbon sequestration and sinks , as well as other social , cultural and economic aspects , are rarely covered and need to be considered .  
The Panel recognized that institutional needs include the strengthening of existing national research institutions ; subregional and regional networks ; joint research ventures ; approaches to enhancing and strengthening existing international , regional , subregional and national forest research institutions ' participation in an international network dedicated to the conservation and sustainable development , management and utilization of forests and forest policy research ; and the creation of appropriate mechanisms that could enable research findings to reach policy and field levels more effectively and could support concrete action .  
The Panel agreed that in order to achieve the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests it is necessary to deal coherently with all the interrelated social , cultural , economic , trade , environment , development , production , financial and technology issues that have a concrete impact on those objectives .  
Progress in the post-UNCED debate was attested by : the increased focus on exploring the scope of complementarities between trade liberalization , economic development and environmental protection ; the greater degree of confidence built up between the environmental and trade communities ; a balanced and integrated approach to the trade and environment agenda encouraged by the international community ; and , the work programmes of UNCTAD , WTO and UNEP which , together with the Commission on Sustainable Development , had clearly anchored the objectives of sustainable development and the trade and environment theme .  
The Commission stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts at both national and international levels to make trade and environmental policies mutually supportive and , more generally , to promote sustainable development , including by designing and implementing positive measures and by providing effective economic incentives .  
WWhat are the lessons to be learned from BITs as regards increasing the quantity and quality of investment flows and advancing sustainable social and economic development in host developing countries ? 
Intergovernmental dialogue on sustainable development could usefully be reorganized to consider a limited number of strategic priority issues , so as to develop a more focused approach to relevant activities in the United Nations system both at the international and at the regional and country levels .  
Task managers should be encouraged to promote joint programming at the regional and subregional levels , and to foster a more integrated approach which incorporates the social and economic dimensions of sustainable development .  
ESCWA reports an increase in the number of projects implemented on the basis of the TCDC modality , and has cited two examples , namely , on local community development in rural areas , and on preparatory assistance for regional support to the national pursuit of sustainable human development .  
Emphasizes the need for new flows of financial resources to the indebted developing countries , and urges the creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase financial assistance on favourable terms as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms , combating poverty , and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
In the case of UNDP , its new programming cycle will rely upon three major categories for funding programmes and projects , namely : ( a ) global programme funds that go towards supporting cross-cutting issues related to sustainable human development ; ( b ) regional programme funds to be used by the regional bureaux for supporting the main thematic areas of UNDP ( e.g . , poverty eradication , environmental protection , women in development ) ; and ( c ) country-level resources used for activities at the national level .  
All responsible actors are requested to adopt a holistic , coordinated and collaborative approach to integrating a gender perspective into sustainable development , between governmental ministries and departments and , at the international level , between United Nations agencies , funds and bodies and other international entities .  
Multilateral and bilateral donors , Governments and the private sector should increase support to non-governmental organizations , particularly to women 's organizations , in playing an active role in advocacy for the implementation of Agenda 21 at the international and national levels , particularly in supporting national policies and programmes for sustainable development in the developing countries .  
All relevant actors should be encouraged to work in partnership with adolescent girls and boys , utilizing both formal and non-formal educational training activities , inter alia , through sustainable consumption patterns and responsible use of natural resources .  
Calls upon the Government of Guatemala , URNG and Guatemalan society as a whole to make every possible effort to familiarize the Guatemalan people with the content of the Peace agreements as quickly as possible , to ensure the full participation of the people in building the new multi _ ethnic , multicultural and plurilingual nation , establishing a democratic society with social justice , initiating a period of sustained and sustainable economic and social development and ensuring the pre _ eminence of civilian authority in national decision _ making ;  
Twelve reports on finance for development ; global financial integration and the strengthening of collaboration between the United Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions , in particular IMF ( two ) ; external debt crisis and development ( two ) ; sustainable development and international economic cooperation : implementation and follow-up to major consensus agreements on development ; financing of development , including net transfer of resources between developed and developing countries ; and overall socio-economic perspective of the world economy ;  
At the global level , ACC has established a number of inter-agency groups in order to provide integrated support for country-level action on interrelated themes , namely basic social services for all ; enabling environment for economic and social development ; employment and sustainable livelihoods ; women and gender equality ; and sustainable development .  
The entities within the United Nations system have an important role to play in developing a reference framework for the energy-related activities of the United Nations system based on a common understanding of a sustainable energy future , and thereby providing synergies to the activities . 3 Such a framework would promote a balanced and mutually reinforcing approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of sustainable energy development and foster partnerships for sustainable energy development with relevant actors outside the United Nations system , particularly with non-United Nations intergovernmental organizations dealing with energy and the private sector . 
The main objectives of the Committee on Environment and Natural Resources Development will be to promote regional and subregional cooperation for sustainable development and to strengthen national capacities in the field of the environment , including integration of environmental concerns into development strategies , in line with the provisions of Agenda 21 and other subsequent decisions ; development and management of natural resources , including water , mineral and energy resources ( excluding infrastructural aspects of electric power ) ; diffusion and management of environmentally sound technologies ; space technology applications ; and natural disaster reduction .  
These agreements constitute a starting point for a hemisphere-wide position on sustainable development - the cornerstone of a cooperative alliance among the States of the Americas in their common search for a better quality of life for their peoples , based on integrated , mutually reinforcing economic , social and environmental objectives .  
The themes that recurred in the reports and their presentation acknowledged the role of new technologies introduced in order to generate digital geographical data for improved map production purposes and to feed geographical information systems ( GIS ) as essential tools for supporting better planning of sustainable development and environmental management . 
The role of the geospatial framework was recognized as critical for economic and sustainable development and the integration of the " 3S technologies " ( remote sensing , GPS and GIS ) was seen as essential for efficient management of natural resources .  
The deliberations of the three committees confirmed once again how the parallel developments in cartographic and in information technology were rapidly bringing to users cost-effective applications in surveying , charting and mapping as a comprehensive set of the tools and effective approaches required to meet the challenge of sustainable development and the priorities of the countries in the region .  
The main objectives are twofold : first , to create a wider understanding and awareness of the critical synergies between women , population pressures , poverty , environmental degradation and sustainable development , and secondly , to discuss practical ways for forging partnerships at the national , regional and international levels for the implementation of effective policies and programmes that can address these issues in a holistic manner . 
Recognizing that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential in achieving sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , and that North-South and South-South transfer of environmentally sound technologies is essential for sustainable development , and recognizing also that the fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their sustainable development requirements has not materialized ,  
In accordance with commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit ( Rome , 13-17 November 1996 ) , 25 sustainable food security among both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
States that , through the rational application in outer space of the technical and technological legacy of the arms race , instead of its hasty destruction , the use of the existing nuclear missile potential of the Russian Federation , the United States of America , and other countries for the benefit of sustainable development is capable of giving impetus to the preservation and improvement of the environment by mobilizing extraterrestrial energy and material resources for the development of civilization ,  
An appeal by the special session to the Governments of the Russian Federation and the United States of America to consider the rational employment of their missile and nuclear potential as a contribution of these two countries to common efforts to ensure sustainable development and preservation of the natural environment of this earth ; to start - should the response of the two Governments be positive - developing relevant international programmes and projects ensuring respect for the regime of non-proliferation of nuclear and missile technologies and for intellectual property rights ;  
Commit ourselves to securing the participation of all actors of civil society , in particular women , youth and children , and voluntary organizations , in the national efforts towards implementation of Agenda 21 , and decide to promote regional camps for schoolchildren and encourage their active participation in environmental protection and sustainable management of natural resources ;  
Urge all SAARC countries to preserve rare , fragile , ecologically sensitive coastal and marine ecosystems , such as mangroves , coral reefs , sea-grass beds , etc . , for conservation and sustainable use of the resources under national jurisdiction .  
It is becoming clear that a State that can address complex social problems , enhance participation in public life and safeguard the rule of law , due process and respect for human rights is a State which " promotes social justice , ensures universal access to quality services and productive assets and creates an enabling environment for sustainable , people-centred development " , in the terms of resolution 50 / 225 .  
Among the many activities of the Observer Mission , human rights , humanitarian and public information programmes will be necessary to create conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development .  
The permanent reintegration of ex-combatants into civilian life extends well beyond successful disarmament and is determined by whether or not there exist concrete , long-term options for obtaining a sustainable livelihood and participating in the social and political life of the country .  
This commitment must also be linked to increased international support for the institution of asylum , and for identifying solutions , if the High Commissioner is to exercise her mandated protection functions of securing the fundamental rights of refugees , asylum-seekers and others in need of international protection ; playing a supervisory and standard-setting role in developing international refugee law ; and identifying and helping to implement fair and sustainable solutions .  
The transfer of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies to developing countries relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms . "  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development . "  
Encourages Governments and intergovernmental organizations to coordinate regional and international cooperation and facilitate the exchange of information and experience among the specialized agencies and relevant international and regional organizations , research institutions and non _ governmental organizations on the issues related to mountain regions , including the manageability and interaction of mountains and the economy , the impact of mountains on the socio _ economic development of countries , the sustainable human development and the like ;  
Underlines the observation of the Secretary-General that the essential prerequisite for the successful completion of peaceful reintegration of the Region is the full cooperation of the Government of the Republic of Croatia , which bears the responsibility for convincing the local population that the reintegration of the people of the Region is sustainable and that the process of reconciliation and return is irreversible ;

Affirming the link between peace and development , noting that significant international assistance is indispensable for sustainable development in Haiti , and stressing that a sustained commitment by the international community and the international financial institutions to assist and support the economic , social and institutional development in Haiti is indispensable for long-term peace and security in the country ,  
It also requires a fair legal system , efficient democratic institutions , popular participation and the promotion of sustainable economic development as preconditions for social stability .  
Affirming the link between peace and development , noting that significant international assistance is indispensable for sustainable development in Haiti , and stressing that a sustained commitment by the international community and the international financial institutions to assist and support the economic , social and institutional development in Haiti is indispensable for long-term peace and security in the country ,  
The individual elements of a culture of peace are therefore : non-violence and respect for human rights , respect and solidarity among all peoples and dialogue between cultures , the linkage of peace to democratic participation and sustainable human development , the free flow and sharing of information and knowledge , contribution to conflict-prevention and post-conflict peace-building , and equality between women and men , all best supported through projects in which people take an active role in transforming their values , attitudes and behaviours .  
A sustainable improvement in export performance requires not only productivity growth based on rising investment rates , but also policies that ensure that real wages do not increase faster than productivity growth , and that the exchange rate is maintained at a stable and competitive level .  
This programme comprises , mainly , the organized transfer of meteorological and hydrological knowledge and proven methodology among the members of the organization , with the overall objective of enabling the national meteorological and hydrological services of members States , especially the least developed and other developing countries , to provide the best possible level of services so as to ensure public safety , management of water resources , support sustainable socio-economic development and safeguard the environment .  
The Fund and the World Bank have initiated the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative11 which was first implemented in April 1997 , and which envisages exceptional assistance to a qualifying country from all its bilateral and multilateral creditors to reduce the current value of the country 's debt to a sustainable level .  
The mid-term global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s identified the following as the main challenges facing the least developed countries in the second half of the 1990s : to reverse the decline in economic and social conditions ; to promote sustainable economic growth , development and structural transformation ; and to avoid becoming further marginalized in the international economy .  
The Assembly also stressed that , in the light of the ongoing discussions on reform within the United Nations , international institutional arrangements in the area of sustainable development were intended to contribute to the goal of strengthening the entire United Nations system .  
The Boards of IMF and the Bank decide whether Naples stock terms , together with at least comparable relief by other bilateral and commercial creditors , are sufficient to bring the country to a sustainable debt-service position , based on a sustainability analysis agreed with the country 's authorities .  This is called the decision point .  
The objectives of the programme are as follows : ( a ) to establish regional , national and local consensus among the main protagonists ( Governments , civil society , cooperating community and United Nations agencies ) with regard to goals and action for sustainable human development ; ( b ) to strengthen the technical capacity of the programmes and promote joint action by the United Nations system in relation to the strategy ; ( c ) to consolidate ongoing local development processes ; ( d ) to transfer experience at the international level .  
The General Assembly , at its nineteenth special session , recognized that the " management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests are a crucial factor in economic and social development , in environmental protection and in the planet 's life-support system .  
The General Assembly acknowledged that " to maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide " ( A / S-19 / 29 , annex , para .  39 ) .  
Consider the feasibility of establishing an international fund to support activities for sustainable forest management ; and explore innovative ways both to use existing financial mechanisms more effectively and to generate new and additional public and private financial resources ;  
Continuing the international dialogue on the issues of conservation and sustainable use of coastal and marine biodiversity and agricultural biological diversity was also very important , since both issues were essential to food security , which was the focus of the forthcoming World Food Summit ; the work being undertaken by the Intergovernmental Panel on forests was likewise crucial to that discussion .  
She emphasized the importance of the work of the Ad Hoc Intergovernmental Panel on Forests , which would lay the foundations for building on the Intergovernmental Panel 's activities in five key areas : provision of clear and comprehensive directions to international organizations and instruments dealing with forests ; setting of common priorities ; regular measuring of collective progress towards sustainable forest management ; creation of an independent high-level political forum to provide governance on forest issues ; and participation of all interested parties .  
In the coming months , Canada would continue to promote action in favour of sustainable development at various important regional and global meetings , and it was committed to cooperating for the achievement of satisfactory results at the forthcoming special session of the General Assembly on the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
The international community could contribute to the implementation of the sustainable development programmes required for economic and social progress in the developing countries by providing financial and technical support to those countries and facilitating access to environmentally sound alternative technologies .  
The countries in transition needed special measures by the international community and the United Nations to promote sustainable agricultural development , and the Russian Federation hoped that the particular interests of those countries would be reflected in an adequate and balanced way in the final document of the World Food Summit .  
In the light of that situation , the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 , had noted with concern that the overall resource allocation for the development of food and agriculture in developing countries had continued to decline and urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable agriculture in developing countries .  
His delegation wished to reiterate that in order to achieve global food security , sustainable productive agriculture and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , developed and developing countries alike must cooperate with a view to the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Uruguay Round , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 .  
Kenya appreciated the role of UNIDO in industrial development cooperation and concurred with the Secretary-General that developing countries increasingly required the policy advisory and capacity-building services of UNIDO in support of their endeavours to create an enabling environment for sustainable industrial growth and international competitiveness .  
Her delegation hoped that within the framework of UNIDO , UNCTAD and other relevant United Nations bodies , adequate support would be extended to developing countries for the removal of structural deficiencies impeding the transformation of the industrial sector and the creation of the conditions necessary for sustainable self-reliant industrialization .  
Developing countries increasingly required the technical assistance and capacity-building services of the united Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) , which supported endeavours to create an environment propitious for sustainable industrial growth and international competitiveness .  
While it is evident that crime , particularly economic and organized crime in its transnational dimensions , is detrimental to the sustainable development of the African countries , financial cuts in this research area may have negative long-term consequences for the continent as a whole .  
An independent and powerful judiciary should have the capacity to establish sustainable lasting and autonomous control policies independent from the executive and legislative branches , with a clear responsibility oriented to public service , responding in an opportune , impartial , balanced , effective and transparent manner to all demands that are placed before it .  
The Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , as established at the Managua meeting , is an ambitious and comprehensive initiative guided by the principles of respect for life ; peace ; democracy ; the observance of human rights ; economic integration ; and the responsibility of succeeding generations for sustainable development ( A / 49 / 580-S / 1994 / 1217 , annex I ) .  
In the area of economic and social development , UNDP has focused on the formulation and implementation of a new initiative known as the Programme for the Promotion of Human Sustainable Development in Central America ( PROGRESS / CA ) , aiming at establishing regional , local and national consensus among the main social actors ( Governments , civil societies , international donors / NGOs and United Nations agencies ) on goals and actions towards human sustainable development .  
It is important that national and international environmental and social policies be implemented and strengthened in order to ensure that globalization trends have a positive impact on sustainable development , especially in developing countries .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
There is a need for concerted action by all countries and for improved cooperation to assist developing countries in implementing the relevant agreements and instruments in order that they may participate effectively in the sustainable use , conservation and management of their fishery resources , as provided for in the Convention and other international legal instruments , and achieve integrated coastal zone management .  
To maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide .  
Noting the vital role of energy in the continuation of sustained economic growth , especially for developing countries , be they importers or suppliers of energy , and recognizing the complexities and interdependencies inherent in addressing energy issues within the context of sustainable development , preparations for this session should be initiated at the seventh session and should utilize an open-ended intergovernmental group of experts on energy and sustainable development to be held in conjunction with inter-sessional meetings of the eighth and ninth sessions of the Commission .  
The international community has recognized the need for an integrated approach to the protection and sustainable management of land and soil resources , as stated in decision III / 11 of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity , [ 34 ] including identification of land degradation , which involves all interested parties at the local as well as the national level , including farmers , small-scale food producers , indigenous people ( s ) , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , women , who have a vital role in rural communities .  
In accordance with the commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit , [ 35 ] sustainable food security for both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .  
The transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
External assistance for building the requisite infrastructure and for national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in accordance with paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 , is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
For developing countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , that is accessible to all and that augments both human capacity and well-being .  
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
An important result of the special session was a strong reaffirmation of political commitment from all Member States and all major groups of civil society to sustainable development , as well as recognition of a key role to be played in this area by the United Nations in close partnership with all actors at various levels .  
In Madrid in October 1994 , the Interim Committee of IMF adopted a declaration on a partnership for sustainable global growth , 4 which the Committee updated and broadened at its autumn ( northern hemisphere ) meeting in 1996.5 This set of international guidelines for macroeconomic and financial policy was intended as a framework for policy-making by all IMF members and to guide the Funds policy discussions with members . 
The Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 122 of 20 December 1995 , reaffirmed that such a dialogue should be conducted in response to the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development as well as improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development .  
The dialogue could build on the work of the High-Level Advisory Board on Sustainable Development , which in 1996 considered how new information technologies that were broadly accessible could contribute to sustainable development by promoting economic growth , improving access to information and promoting civil society . 11 The new technologies , and related institutional changes such as privatization , offer opportunities to extend services to previously unserved communities and to promote broader participation in development , but may also have economic , social and cultural risks . 
Within the technical cooperation project developed by the Office in support of the Decade , aimed at strengthening national capacities for human rights education , guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national plans of action for human rights education . 
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
Although there is no universal prescription for successful development , a consensus has emerged , inter alia , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework of our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
National plans of action and other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by Governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
From these conferences , a consensus has emerged on a multidimensional , comprehensive and integrated approach to development which recognizes , among other things , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
In this connection , the Assembly of African Heads of State and Government of OAU at their thirty-third ordinary session , in June 1997 , adopted the Harare Declaration ( Dec . 4 ( XXXIII ) ) on African industrialization in which they , inter alia , decided to redouble efforts to promote sustainable industrial development to overcome major economic and social constraints and achieve a greater stake in the global market place as called for in the Lagos Plan of Action and the Abuja Treaty Establishing the African Economic Community .  
The leaders also reaffirmed their belief that , without sustainable industrial development , African economies would be condemned to persistent economic crisis , dependence on humanitarian relief and deepening poverty , despair and political unrest with dire consequences for global peace and stability .  
Increasing the value added to the processing of local raw materials ; the transformation of hides and skins into exportable leather products in eight eastern and southern African countries ; the manufacture of wood products in order to provide opportunities for the environmentally sustainable development of forest resources in seven western and central African countries ; the processing of spices and aromatic products in Zanzibar ; and the introduction of new techniques for the production of salt in the Plateau State of Nigeria ;  
Furthermore , it recognized the existence of systematic and technological causes of environmental degradation in rural areas of the LDCs , and supported institutional and social programmes for sustainable development in those countries .  
Acknowledging that there are links , under certain circumstances , between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and which take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
The 1996 special seminars organized by the Office of Legal Affairs and UNITAR covered the following topics : 13 ( a ) International protection of human rights ; ( b ) International humanitarian law ; ( c ) Refugee law ; ( d ) International law and sustainable development ; ( e ) International economic law ; ( f ) World Trade Organization and the multilateral trading system ; ( g ) International environmental law ; and ( h ) Law of the sea .  
Also reaffirms that such a dialogue should be conducted in response to the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development and for improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development , and that the United Nations system should play a central role in strengthening such a dialogue ;  
Despite their economic limitations , the developing countries had made strenuous efforts to achieve the objectives of the Programme , and in particular to integrate more fully demographic changes and the development processes , since population programmes were accepted as a fundamental component of any viable strategy for sustainable economic and social development .  
According to these targets , by the year 2000 all countries should have in place , as part of their national plans to achieve sustainable development , ( a ) comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards integrated into development plans , ( b ) mitigation plans of practical measures for application at national and local levels to address long-term disaster prevention , preparedness and community awareness , and ( c ) ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems .  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
UNDP will help to expand a current IDB , World Bank and ECLAC regional programme aimed at improving household surveys and the capacity of countries to measure living standards and poverty conditions , a key instrument for the design and monitoring of public policies in the context of sustainable human development .  
The activities included the enhancement of statistical methodologies , which were vital in evaluating the Institutes programmes and projects ; the preparation of a multi-media modular package on women , environmental management and sustainable development , in cooperation with the International Training Centre of the International Labour Organization in Turin ; and the drafting , currently in progress , of a manual to assist womens organizations in maximizing the use of computer-mediated communication technologies in all their activities .  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society , are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Also emphasizes that an equitable and favourable national and international economic , political , social and legal environment , in accordance with the provisions of chapter 1 of the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development , is essential for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Further reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 [ 6 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Welcomes in this regard resolution 35 / 2 adopted by the Commission on the priority theme " Productive employment and sustainable livelihoods " and the agreed conclusions contained therein , [ 8 ] in which the Commission recognized , inter alia , the importance of full , productive , appropriately and adequately remunerated , and freely chosen employment as a central objective of economic and social policies ; defining time-bound goals and targets for expanding employment and reducing unemployment ; and preparing policies for the achievement of those goals and targets ;  
Mindful that all countries should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , and that the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , have important responsibilities to cooperate with developing countries so as to enhance the developing countries ' efforts to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of finance , trade and external indebtedness ,  
Emphasizes that the Business Plan marks a watershed in the history of the Organization , defines activities to be undertaken by the Organization in future , reinforces the continuation of UNIDO in global forum functions and in areas where UNIDO has comparative advantage , enabling it to function as a specialized agency within the United Nations system in the field of industrial development for supporting the endeavours of developing countries and those in transition to achieve sustainable development ;  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by eighteen years of war , and underlining the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards a sustainable economic and social development , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least-developed and war-stricken country ,  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , international financial organizations and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;  
Stressing the importance of the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America and the setting of national and regional priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental spheres and in the areas of public security and regional integration ,  
Emphasizes the importance of supporting and strengthening the new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities laid down in the new sustainable development programme for the region ;  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of the region ;  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ,  
Most important , the Agenda for Development embodies the consensus of the international community that development means sustainable development ; that is , that improving the quality of life of all people , in both present and future generations , requires integrating economic development , social development and environmental protection , which , as the international community has declared and reaffirmed in various consensus documents , are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission on Human Settlements , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Considering that parliamentarians can contribute substantially to sustainable development by promoting legislative changes , improving public policy and strengthening institutions for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda2 and the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements13 at the local , national , regional and international levels ,  
The Istanbul Declaration and the conference 's plan of action - the Habitat Agenda - provide a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in the urbanized world of the twenty-first century , as well as critical guidance for ensuring that all people have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the urban and housing indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , that is , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
But I feel that it is appropriate to repeat the principal characteristic of our development model , which is a harmonious and rational complementary relationship between economic and social policies , which for the first time in many years is enabling us to carry out a realistic strategy for sustainable human development .  
Accordingly , he continuously advocated in his lifetime the creation of a new global human order premised on sustainable economic development , equity and social and ecological justice , and based on the creation of a separate global development fund for assistance to both the North and the South .  
By building peace , reducing unsustainable military expenditures , promoting equitable and sustainable development and encouraging stable , democratic societies which respect human rights , we not only limit human suffering , but we also address the root causes of conflict itself .  
The Secretary-General has recognized that the future of the United Nations can be secured only by a clearer focus and better coordination of effort , expertise and resources on the key priorities real peace and security , sustainable development , equitable economic and social progress , humanitarian action and , underlying all of these , the safeguarding of universal human rights .  
Malta fully supports the efforts of the Organization in the promotion of environmental protection and the sustainable use of the world \ x { e5b8 } natural resources to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth , and of an international trade regime free of restrictive or discriminatory practices .  
The key elements for attaining sustainable economic development are a sound policy framework that encourages stable growth , a vigorous private sector , the strengthening of institutional and legal foundations and , last but not least , good-governance and anti-corruption measures .  
We must mobilize the dynamic private sector , together with bilateral and multilateral official development assistance to secure sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries .  
Although we were not entirely satisfied with the results of the recent nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held last summer , it is important that that session outlined ways of expediting progress in key areas of sustainable development , as defined in Agenda 21 .  
We are therefore pursuing economic , social and infrastructural development in a sustainable way which avoids environmental degradation , conserves our natural resource endowment and helps to build and maintain a long-term national capacity to support rising standards of living for the population , as well as opportunities for self-actualization .  
For its part the Government of Benin , while awaiting the fulfilment of that hope , has developed the concept of a shared social minimum level in order methodically and effectively to take actions and measures aimed at eliminating poverty , hunger , disease and illiteracy , providing adequate housing , guaranteeing productive employment , improving standards and conditions of living and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources .  
The Sultanate of Oman has prepared a national strategy to protect the environment that aims at achieving balanced and sustainable development , a strategy that would treat economic , social and environmental considerations on an equal footing .  
International cooperation and the benefits that are drawn from it , whether through bilateral or multilateral means , can not be a substitute for what individual countries must do to ensure that sustainable development is achieved and economic growth is realized .  
We are fully aware that at the level of the United Nations , there have been a number of initiatives designed to help address the economic and social problems faced by developing countries and to mitigate the effects of poverty and the impact of those conditions hindering the realization of sustainable economic development .  
In this regard , our objectives are to correct the economic , financial and structural imbalances ; to achieve steadiness and stability in the economy as a whole ; to activate the role of the private sector in the competitive free-market economy ; to achieve sustainable development ; to foster stable environments so as to attract foreign investments ; to upgrade the basic necessary services of society ; and to build the new State and improve the standards of living of all citizens .  
Our Organization , with its universal membership , comprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities , is the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the universal goals we all strive for : a secure and peaceful future , a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor , full respect for human rights , free and equitable trade , the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development .  
In our ceaseless struggle as a small nation to achieve people-centred development goals , the present Government , within the international constraints of sustainable development and environmental protection , will continue its endeavours to increase domestic efficiency and international competitiveness in agriculture , production , manufacturing and export , as well as to strengthen the institutions of local entrepreneurship , with a view to ensuring political stability and fostering equitable economic growth .  
The interdependence of the situation emerging in Central Asia , the common European security system taking shape and the outlook for developing situations within the vast Asian continent means there is an urgent need for the international community to take measures to ensure durable peace and stability in this region along with its sustainable development .  
The debate justifies the conclusion that an adequate response to these and other issues is to be delivered through a continuing process of negotiations ; a resolute policy of disarmament , both of weapons of mass destruction and of conventional weapons ; the promotion of sustainable development ; the further strengthening of human rights machinery ; and the gradual reorientation of the United Nations peacekeeping activities toward preventive diplomacy .  
The Commission , which at its thirty-fifth session considered the question of employment and sustainable livelihoods , reached certain agreed conclusions that have as their goal productive employment ; decreasing unemployment through improved social services , such as education and health care ; giving loans to the private sector in both urban and rural areas ; and improving information and guidance services .  
My country appreciates the enormous efforts made by developed and developing countries alike to address the great challenge of sustainable economic and social development , despite the weighty responsibilities imposed upon them by economic reform .  
Not only do basic health and education produce invaluable individual and social benefits , both are essential for sustainable economic development and constitute an investment in people \ x { e5b8 } hope for the future .  
Among the key objectives of this policy are the sustainable development of the region , based on overcoming poverty , and the participation of organized civil society and the population in general , as well as environmental preservation and the rational and sustainable use of natural resources .  
If we do not create an international environment favourable to economic growth and sustainable and comprehensive development , it will be almost impossible , particularly for the large majority of third world countries , to make steady progress along the road to social development .  
In conclusion , I wish to express my delegation \ x { e5b8 } sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Social Summit will help generate renewed political will at the national , regional and international levels to attain the noble objectives of sustainable human development .  
Likewise , in keeping with a modern , integrated concept , the Romanian Government has approached social issues in close relation with economic growth and the complex factors involved in sustainable human development .  
These actions have strengthened the role of the University and allowed for alternative ways of improving quality of living , achieving sustainable development and contributing to the progress of less developed cultures .  
This Assembly is abundant in priorities identified by the recent round of global conferences , particularly in the areas of good governance , human rights , democratization , international economic cooperation and sustainable development , development operations , preventive diplomacy , peaceful settlement of disputes and disarmament , as well as humanitarian action and peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building .  
In this regard , it should be emphasized that the Jakarta Mandate covering the following areas : integrated marine and coastal area management ; marine and coastal protected areas ; sustainable use of marine and coastal living resources ; and mariculture and alien species called , inter alia , for the effective implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity concerning marine and coastal biodiversity questions .  
We have consistently extended our firm support to this legal regime , which has paved the path to securing our common goal of ensuring long-term , stable and sustainable living resources of the vast oceans and seas based on cooperation , mutual benefit and shared responsibility .  
Bearing in mind those facts and the requirements of our national societies in an international context that is marked by globalization and the interdependence of the phenomena affecting it , and recognizing that it is difficult for the Central American countries to deal with them individually , we must be more creative in order to ensure that our political and economic integration at the international level will be positive in terms of our goals of democratization and sustainable development .  
Moreover , it is not always true that sustainable development based on private-sector initiatives should be the driving force towards attaining rapid social development and environmental protection in developing countries .  
To most developing countries , the sustainable development approach , as emphasized by most of our developed partners , is considered restrictive , limiting economic growth to social development and protection of the environment .  
Such a dialogue is expected to contribute to the efforts to identify a number of key elements required to respond to the challenges and opportunities emanating from the process of globalization notably , the trends towards closer regional cooperation and integration , growing interdependence , the mutually interdependent link between peace and prosperity , the linkage between the imperatives of the economic and social aspects of promoting sustainable development and the recognition that partnership for development is among the most compelling challenges facing the world community .  
Convinced that economic growth can be achieved only if accompanied by increasing levels of sustainable development , the Central American countries wish to inform the international community of our decision to move forward resolutely towards a common future , a future of great progress and solidarity for our peoples .  
This session is confronted with the onerous task not only of pointing to the imbalances that have emerged since Rio between the advances in political and economic reforms achieved in the third world and the clearly diminishing resources to fund sustainable development , but also of securing a renewed commitment , with firm assurances , to stronger financial aid .  
Although the world community set out on the right path with the adoption of Agenda 21 in Rio , and although steps are being taken on the national and international levels towards achieving our goals , globalization , economic and social disparities , pressing agricultural and industrial needs , serious financial constraints and technological deficiencies all combine to make sustainable development an elusive target .  
During these last five years our initial predictions concerning sustainable development have been justified insofar as this process has proved to be a very complex global endeavour embodying all aspects of human life and requiring awareness and active participation at all levels .  
This multifaceted process of sustainable development necessitates constant and close multilateral cooperation as well as concerted efforts on a regional and national basis .  
It is obvious that without a comprehensive sustainable energy strategy , global warming will continue unabated , urban air with continue to deteriorate and marine pollution will not be halted .  
A well-educated civil service , with high professional standards and resistant to pressure from privileged groups relating to distributional issues , can also be a significant force for stable and sustainable economic policies .  
The Beijing Platform for Action describes poverty as having various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; social discrimination and exclusion ; and lack of participation in decision-making and in civil , social and cultural life .  
The Centre for Family Friendly Cities of the University of Akron , Ohio , United States of America , created an interactive communications network on the World Wide Web designed to store , search and retrieve information on , inter alia , family relationships , sexuality and reproduction , special problems and risk factors , family counselling and education , cultural social and urban issues , basic needs , leisure and entertainment , consumption and sustainable development and work .  
Clearing arrears and establishing a sustainable debt-servicing position create an opportunity which , combined with structural adjustment and official financial support , can promote foreign and private investment and , thus , economic growth .  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
As a cooperative activity of UNEP , the World Resources Institute ( WRI ) and IUCN , a set of guidelines on the preparation of biodiversity strategies and action plans was prepared and global biodiversity forums were organized to assist Governments and the public in integrating biodiversity components in improving the understanding of the role of biodiversity in sustainable development and in monitoring implementation and the reporting of progress made .  
Issues of biosafety have emerged with regard to national capacity needed for the implementation of effective in situ conservation measures , through establishing and maintaining the means to regulate , manage or control risks associated with invasive species and / or the use and release of living modified organisms resulting from biotechnology and likely to have adverse environmental impacts on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
The increasing recognition that biotechnology can provide solutions for many problems fundamental to sustainable development makes it essential to establish national legislation to ensure the adequate protection of human health and the environment in connection with the contained use and release of genetically modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnologies .  
A substantial number of countries ( 150 ) have established national-level commissions or coordinating mechanisms designed to develop an integrated approach to sustainable development and to include a wide range of civil society sectors in the process of agenda-setting and strategy-building .  
Paragraph 238 explains that , in the provision of assistance , facilitating mechanisms are to be supported for independent , detached , impartial and objective monitoring of human settlements progress , especially through collecting , analysing and disseminating information and ideas about adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
Progress has been made in creating greater awareness of the mountain agenda and improving coordination of efforts to protect fragile mountain ecosystems and promote sustainable mountain development , largely as a result of international and regional intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations consultations , which have provided a focus on key mountain issues and led to recommendations relevant at both the global and regional levels . 
The global community has also made considerable progress in recognizing the contributions to sustainable agriculture of the conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , as reflected , for example , in the decision of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity at its third meeting to establish a multi-year programme of activities on the sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , aiming , inter alia , to promote the positive and mitigate the negative effects of agricultural practices on biological diversity .  
The following important common policy approaches are emerging in the promotion of SARD : ( a ) the use of economic incentives to guide sustainable agricultural practices ; ( b ) education and information exchange for human development ; ( c ) the development and transfer of new and appropriate technologies ; ( d ) farm and off-farm employment for alleviating poverty ; ( e ) sound natural resource management leading to environmental protection ; and ( f ) focusing on men and women farmers themselves .  
However , it clearly places the financing of sustainable development within the global economic context by stating that developing countries will need substantial new and additional funds for the implementation of sustainable development programmes , and that official development assistance ( ODA ) should be a main source of external funding for those countries , especially the least developed countries .  
Nevertheless , the conclusions and recommendations of international experts have regularly emphasized that while private flows are a necessary condition for sustainable development they are not sufficient , because first , most of the poorest countries do not obtain substantial amounts of private capital , and second , sustainable development requires some types of social and environmental investments that do not attract private capital .  
There are some successful models for international financial mechanisms , such as joint implementation programmes ( e.g . , the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly ( AIJ ) established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its first meeting and international environmental funds ( e.g . , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and the Montreal Protocol Environmental Fund ( MPEF ) ) which have transferred developed country resources to developing countries for investments in sustainable development related to the protection of the global environment . 
At its third session , the Commission proposed ways to enhance the effectiveness of ODA through the elaboration of national sustainable development strategies , with the participation of all interested parties ; the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external resources , through such schemes as co-financing , joint ventures , underwriting of country risks and venture capital funds ; and the promotion of public and political support in donor countries for raising ODA levels .  
The predominant role of the private sector in the transfer and diffusion of ESTs and , more importantly , its leading function in the transition to cleaner production , have increased the private sector 's responsibility for ensuring that technology-related investments and industrial and business operations are consistent with community requirements for sustainable lifestyles and environmental protection .  
In the initial consultations between UNESCO , UNEP and IUCN on developing a broad international alliance for education for sustainable development , the crucial role of non-governmental organizations and other major groups was stressed .  
The changes called for - reforming educational systems , rethinking the outcomes of education , developing an interdisciplinary conceptual framework that reflects the complexity of the notion of sustainable development , agreeing on the key messages , changing attitude , lifestyles , and so on - will require time and the concerted effort and support of all sectors of society .  
The Brazil / Norway Workshop on Consumption and Production Patterns ( Brasilia , November 1996 ) concluded , among other things , that the role of advertising and the media is critical ; that the international community should apply the resources of the media to induce behavioural changes to avoid waste , inefficient resource use and conspicuous consumption ; and that positive messages of how individuals can live in a sustainable manner were required , instead of encouraging ever-rising material consumption or exaggerating the likelihood of environmental disaster .  
Finally , he emphasized the importance in Africa of the informal sector , which constituted a means of survival for a large part of the urban population but which , in its existing form , deprived of access to finance , information and modern technology , was not sustainable . 
Participating States agreed that effective development and implementation of national programmes of action should focus on sustainable , pragmatic and integrated environmental management , harmonized , as appropriate , with ocean basin management and land-use plans .  
While legal and institutional instruments have definitely improved the basis for sustainable development of oceans and coastal areas , implementation lags behind owing , among other things , to ( a ) the difficulty in making political decisions regarding resources and wealth allocation ; ( b ) the difficulty of improving inadequate or inefficient institutions ; and ( c ) in many cases , difficulties in meeting the related financial commitments .  
Acknowledging that there are links , under certain circumstances , between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and which take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems ( including a new series on critical environmental regions ) .  
Yet preoccupation with fiscal consolidation in many developed market economies has led to some shrinkage of social safety nets and stagnation , if not outright reductions , in the volume of official development assistance ( ODA ) .  At the same time , regional conflicts , communal strife and civil war have visited unspeakable tragedy on millions of people - the very antithesis of sustainable development .  
Habitat II ( Istanbul , 1996 ) raised global awareness of the key role of human settlements in sustainable development as the majority of the global population will be living in cities in the next century , thus increasing the urgency of facing the growing social , economic and environmental problems of cities .  
The international community 's attention to this global problem , and the coordination and adoption of an appropriate programme of collective preventive measures , would do much to neutralize or reduce the negative impact of mountain - climate cataclysms on human lives , and would promote the sustainable economic development of mountainous countries and mountain peoples .  
Programme area A ( Promoting sustainable development through trade ) includes among its policy objectives : ( a ) promote an open , non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system ; ( b ) promote access to markets for exports of developing countries ; and ( c ) improve the functioning of commodity markets , and achieve sound , compatible and consistent commodity policies at the national and international levels with a view to optimizing the contribution of the commodity sector to sustainable development , taking into account environmental considerations .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s , ( b ) the potential positive role that transnational corporations could play in conjunction with Governments in achieving global goals on emission standards , and ( c ) the continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
Thus , adopting an integrated treatment of the bases of economic growth , by not only ensuring macroeconomic balance and stability but also directing attention to the industrial base and incentive structures , may do much to enhance the viability of policies that address the environmental and social aspects of sustainable development in individual countries .  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America2 became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
Further , the main focus of three OSCE seminars undertaken in the last two years was on global and regional partnership in the fields of environment management , environmental regulatory mechanisms and the transfer of environmentally safe technologies , international cooperation in protecting the environment , and promoting the economic and legal framework for environmentally sustainable development .  
Secondly , there has been a growing consensus that positive measures are effective instruments in supporting developing countries in their efforts to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , including in the context of multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s ; ( b ) the potential positive role that TNCs could play in conjunction with governments in achieving global goals on emission standards ; and the ( c ) continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
As a result of Beijing , a new emphasis has been placed on enabling women to be active decision makers , planners and designers of projects for sustainable development , particularly at the local level ; improving access of women to skills through expansion of extension services and training in science , technology and economics and developing gender-sensitive databases and integrating traditional knowledge of women into resource management programmes .  
Finally , he emphasized the importance in Africa of the informal sector , which constituted a means of survival for a large part of the urban population but which , in its existing form , deprived of access to finance , information and modern technology , was not sustainable . 
The criteria for sustainable development should include better protection of all human rights : civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as well as protection of the most vulnerable and impoverished .  
The experience of countries which have chosen the challenging road to sustainable development , democracy and human rights , and which are already beginning to enjoy the fruits of this decision in the form of interrelated economic progress , political consolidation and social stability , proves that human rights are not only noble ideas .  
Extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law are highlighted by the resolutions of United Nations organs as being major obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
Thus , it should support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development .  
The Commission stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts at both the national and international levels to make trade and environmental policies mutually supportive and , more generally , to promote sustainable development , including by designing and implementing positive measures and by providing effective economic incentives .  
Agenda 21 and the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development established a comprehensive global approach to the achievement of sustainable development , recognizing the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the importance of international cooperation . 
External assistance for the building of requisite infrastructure and national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
Therefore , at both the national and international levels , further work should be undertaken on the design of appropriate policies for attracting private foreign capital , in particular foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , reducing its volatility , and enhancing its contribution to sustainable development , for example by promoting innovative schemes , such as co-financing and " green " credit lines and investment funds .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly at the primary and secondary levels , including lifelong education , accessible to all , that augments both human capacity and well-being . 
Given the increasing number of decision-making bodies concerned with the various aspects of sustainable development , including international conventions , there is an ever greater need for better policy coordination at the intergovernmental level to ensure consistent and coherent positions of Governments in such processes , as well as enhanced collaboration among their secretariats . 
Appropriate and effective arrangements should be established in order to better support regional and subregional organizations , including the regional commissions , bearing in mind the role that such bodies play in the achievement of the sustainable development objectives agreed at the international level .  
The role of UNEP and its Governing Council , as the principal United Nations body in the field of environment , should be further enhanced , in conformity with the Nairobi Declaration on the Role and Mandate of UNEP , 20 with a view to enabling UNEP to serve as the leading environmental authority that sets the global environmental agenda , promotes the coherent implementation of the environmental dimension of sustainable development within the United Nations system , and acts as an authoritative advocate for the global environment .  
Negotiations for the replenishment of GEF will have special importance for its future work , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national levels .  
All responsible actors are requested to adopt a holistic , coordinated and collaborative approach to integrating a gender perspective into sustainable development , between governmental ministries and departments , and at the international level , between United Nations agencies , funds and bodies and other international entities .  
Multilateral and bilateral donors , Governments and the private sector should increase support to non-governmental organizations , particularly to women 's organizations , in playing an active role in advocacy for the implementation of Agenda 21 at the international and national levels , particularly in supporting national policies and programmes for sustainable development in the developing countries .  
All relevant actors should be encouraged to work in partnership with adolescent girls and boys , utilizing both formal and non-formal educational training activities , inter alia , through sustainable consumption patterns and responsible use of natural resources .  
But if the assumption is that the existing level of funding is unlikely to be increased in the years ahead , then the current system is simply not sustainable and we will witness a steady diminution in the support available to each treaty body and in the ability of each to function in a meaningful way .  
Recognizing that current global mapping efforts are primarily driven by global change concerns , future progress must also be responsive to more immediate national priorities that enhance economic growth and ensure sustainable development .  
The Framework contained a set of practical targets to be achieved by the year 2000 : comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards , with these assessments taken into account in planning for sustainable development ; mitigation plans at national and / or local levels , involving long-term prevention , preparedness and community awareness ; and ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems and broad dissemination of warnings .  
Calls upon the Government of Guatemala , URNG and Guatemalan society as a whole to make every possible effort to familiarize the Guatemalan people with the content of the Peace agreements as quickly as possible , to ensure the full participation of the people in building the new multi _ ethnic , multicultural and multilingual nation , establishing a democratic society with social justice , initiating a period of sustained and sustainable economic and social development and ensuring the pre _ eminence of civilian authority in national decision _ making ;  
Stressing the link between peace and development , noting that significant international assistance is indispensable for sustainable development in Haiti , and stressing that a sustained commitment by the international community and the international financial institutions to assist and support the economic , social and institutional development in Haiti is indispensable for long-term peace and security in the country ,  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
The new emphasis was also prompted by the IMF Executive Boards request that staff pay particular attention to social indicators in the contexts of adjustment programmes supported by the IMFs enhanced structural adjustment facility and of the initiative to help heavily indebted poor countries achieve sustainable external debt positions . 
Invites the Commission on Sustainable Development , the United Nations Environment Programme and other relevant United Nations bodies , funds and programmes , and the World Tourism Organization , to urgently develop strategies with existing national , regional and subregional tourism organizations in small island developing States to further facilitate sustainable tourism development as an essential element towards an action-oriented international programme of work on sustainable tourism ;  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote [ sustained economic growth and sustainable development ] ,  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the Oslo meeting which reaffirmed that promoting access for all basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
In the interests of equity , binding commitments for non-Annex I Parties could not even be envisaged until agreement had been reached on a fair system of apportionment of emission limits , a globally agreed reduction pathway and a projected sustainable future emission level on an equitable basis , and until there was reliable and predictable financial provision for the acquisition and adaptation of sound technologies , know-how and production systems in developing countries .  
Such a strategy should be based on three principles : developed countries should take the lead now in committing themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 level ; developing countries should also take actions to address climate change problems in promoting their sustainable development , taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities under the Convention and their respective capabilities ; and developed countries should strengthen their partnership with developing countries through the provision of financial and technological support for mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions .  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , the international financial organizations , and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
The main activities of the Observer Mission , in addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at supporting and consolidating the national reconciliation process , with a view to creating conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development . 
In the light of the international community 's increasing awareness of slow economic growth in many developing countries and countries in transition from a centrally planned economy to a free-market economy ( transitional economy countries ) and of the related negative global implications , it is essential that the United Nations should promote and implement action-oriented responses aimed at helping those countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth . 
The most effective means of reducing poverty is the adoption of national development strategies , including sound macroeconomic and structural policies , which encourage sustainable growth that increases income-earning opportunities for the poor and develop the human resources of the poor , particularly through broad access to education , health and family planning services .  
Despite the encouraging trend in the international flow of foreign direct investment , net resource flows , particularly to low-income countries and severely indebted lower-middle-income countries , have remained stagnant or declined , highlighting the need for the international community to continue mobilizing adequate financing in support of developing countries ' efforts to move towards external viability combined with sustainable growth .  
There are a number of situations in which partnership between public and private sector institutions is the most efficient and effective mechanism , due to the presence of mutually reinforcing goals - which in the final analysis converge towards an equitable and sustainable economic development of the country - and to the complementarity of capacities and roles .  
The agreed conclusions adopted on women and the environment focused on mainstreaming a gender perspective , translating it into concrete actions and moving beyond the concept of women as a major group . 4 For example , all actors at the international level were requested to adopt a holistic , coordinated and collaborative approach to integrate a gender perspective into sustainable development and to apply a gender perspective in all funding programmes for sustainable development , while acknowledging the importance of continuing programming targeted at women . 
Support is also increasingly requested in a wide range of new areas , such as infrastructure development , reinforcement of national capacities for research and development , environmental regeneration and sustainable development , capacity-building to increase competitiveness in the global economic environment , support in national reconstruction , the continuum of relief and development , public administration reform , disaster management , drug control , human rights and support for institutional reforms .  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
Many lack the capacity to articulate a long-term vision , an integrated policy framework and coherent programming or lack the capacity for policy reconciliation between sustained economic growth and sustainable development or between structural adjustment and social stability .  
Many developing countries , particularly the low-income and least developed ones , are weak in designing policy packages that would enable them to use international trade as an effective tool of sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
For sustained economic growth and sustainable development , a critical mass is necessary not only in physical infrastructure but also in an educated and skilled workforce .  
Fostering an enabling environment for development implies a concerted effort by Governments at the national and international levels , in collaboration with other actors in development , to ensure that the interplay among those policies , measures and institutions and the sum total of their impact promotes not only sustained economic growth but a development style that is sustainable and broad-based and whose benefits are shared equitably by all members of society .  
First and foremost , reinforcing peaceful conditions , a stable political framework , full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , and effective participation by civil society are indispensable foundations for sustainable development .  
Investment ( domestic and foreign ) , capital inflows and access to foreign exchange are facilitated by a low and predictable rate of inflation , a sustainable fiscal deficit and a realistic exchange rate .  
The promotion of joint programming at the regional and subregional levels , leading to a more integrated approach that incorporates the social and economic dimensions of sustainable development , also needs to be encouraged .  
As planned , the Task Force produced a synthesis report for use by the resident coordinator system , summarizing lessons of experience at the country level and across countries with a view to suggesting ways of improving inter-agency collaboration in the future and providing a clear understanding of the different ingredients that work for the promotion of employment and sustainable livelihoods in specific situations and of the necessary indicators for monitoring progress in these areas .  
Achieving continued economic growth of the type that made good use of the assets that the poor own , i.e . labour , investing in human capital , removing distortions that discriminate against the poor and the unemployed , and targeting interventions towards the vulnerable and the extremely poor were found to be the proven ways of promoting employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people centred sustainable development .  
Although there is no universal prescription for successful development , a consensus has emerged , inter alia , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework of our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
From these conferences , a consensus has emerged on a multidimensional , comprehensive and integrated approach to development which recognizes , among others , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
More generally , ACC members called for complementary actions by the United Nations system , in close partnership with other actors , to support country-level efforts at relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , and agreed upon the broad elements of a common strategic framework for response to , and recovery from , crisis , as part of the system 's overall effort to help secure durable peace and pursue or restore sustainable development in countries in crisis situations .  
In addition to a separate subprogramme for the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries , the Special Body on Least Developed and Landlocked Developing Countries and the Special Body on Pacific Island Developing Countries of ESCAP also carry out five other subprogrammes dealing with regional economic cooperation , environment and sustainable development , poverty alleviation and social integration , transport , communications and tourism development and statistics .  Recommendation 2 .  
In addition , recognizing the imperative of a conducive policy environment for participation of resource users in conservation and sustainable management of natural resources , the Fund has launched a comprehensive programme of studies to examine pertinent policy and institutional issues at the national and local levels .  
The Habitat Agenda offered a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in which everyone had adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
In the twenty-first century , megalopolises and cities of all sizes would become the main centres of efforts to achieve sustainable economic , social and environmental development and , at the same time , hubs of world trade and national and global partnership in the areas of industrial and scientific and technological cooperation .  
The international community , by redirecting its focus to sustainable development , would be able to overcome the false dichotomy between economic , social and environmental measures and instead view such measures as integral parts of a single whole .  
The Agenda then tied poverty eradication to the objective agreed at the social development summit , namely " enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work " .  
It is important that national and international environmental and social policies be implemented and strengthened in order to ensure that globalization trends have a positive impact on sustainable development , especially in developing countries .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
There is a need for concerted action by all countries and for improved cooperation to assist developing countries in implementing the relevant agreements and instruments in order that they may participate effectively in the sustainable use , conservation and management of their fishery resources , as provided for in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and other international legal instruments , and achieve integrated coastal zone management . 
To maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide .  
Noting the vital role of energy in the continuation of sustained economic growth , especially for developing countries , be they importers or suppliers of energy , and recognizing the complexities and interdependencies inherent in addressing energy issues within the context of sustainable development , preparations for this session should be initiated at the seventh session and should utilize an open-ended intergovernmental group of experts on energy and sustainable development to be held in conjunction with inter-sessional meetings of the eighth and ninth sessions of the Commission .  
The transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
External assistance for building the requisite infrastructure and for national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in accordance with paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 , is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , that is accessible to all and that augments both human capacity and well-being .  
The Commission 's work programme on indicators of sustainable development should result in a practicable and agreed set of indicators , suited to country-specific conditions , including a limited number of aggregated indicators , to be used at the national level , on a voluntary basis , by the year 2000 . 
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
The emphasis that the African common position placed on poverty reduction as one of its main strategic objectives was intended to let solidarity play its role as a driving force in a sustainable development that would combine environmental preservation with the rational use of the planet \ x { e5b8 } limited resources .  
Greater Johannesburg has been very successful in aligning its local Agenda 21 with its development processes , which has in turn been institutionalized within the legal framework , and it has organized sustainable urban environmental management by integrating it into the overall functioning of local government .  
Aware and convinced that the survival of humanity is a collective responsibility , we decided in Rio to establish a new kind of partnership built of common yet differentiated responsibility in order to promote national , regional and world cooperation for development that we wished to be sustainable .  
Thus , Cameroon , for its part , has worked to develop internal legal provisions and appropriate structures , including , in particular , a law on the forest and animal regime ; the institutionalization and organization of educational seminars on environmental problems ; the creation of a national advisory commission for environment and sustainable development ; and the development of a national plan of action for environmental management .  
The sustainable management of natural resources , the combatting of pollution and environmental degradation , the development of human resources through the implementation of a population policy , education and health , regional integration , the creation of productive jobs in rural areas and through the development of the private sector in order to eradicate poverty all these represent the strategic framework which will make it possible to ensure human sustainable development in our country .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .  
Unfortunately and I repeat , unfortunately the persistent reluctance of the countries of the North to respect their commitments to the developing countries by granting additional financial resources , increasing public development aid to 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and transferring eco-technologies under favourable conditions , is considerably restricting the capacity of these countries to meet the requirements of sustainable development . 
We also salute the many non-governmental organizations in the fields of development and environment , the environmental journalists , the public servants in local authorities , the planners at the national level and the precious few political leaders and diplomats at the international level who in their own way have stuck out their necks on behalf of sustainable development . 
The Commission on Human Settlements , in its resolution 16 / 24 of 7 May 1997 entitled " Special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 " , reaffirmed that sustainable development was essential for human settlements development and expressed the conviction that urban settlements , properly planned and managed , held a promise for human development and for the protection of the world 's natural resources through their ability to support large numbers of people while limiting their negative impact on the natural environment .  
Also in resolution 16 / 24 , the Commission called upon the General Assembly to take into account , at its special session , the Habitat Agenda and the Istanbul Declaration , because urgent action in cities and human settlements was necessary to secure sustainable human settlements and safe and healthy living conditions , especially for urban populations .  That was in recognition of the impact of urbanization on all sectors of sustainable human settlements .  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environmental protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , prevention of drug trafficking and abuse , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , eradication of poverty and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
From a sustainable development perspective , the two principal concerns of developing countries with regard to foreign direct investment ( FDI ) are ( a ) attracting FDI as a source of long-term capital , and ( b ) enhancing the role of FDI in advancing social and environmental objectives .  
This section analyses provisions on financial transfers and mechanisms in recent MEAs ( in particular provisions on " compliance assistance " contained in the Montreal Protocol , the CBD and the FCCC ) , as well as other ways of generating new public and private financial resources to assist developing countries in promoting sustainable development and more particularly in tackling global environmental problems .  
Clear examples and opportunities exist for providing benefits to source countries as well as indigenous and local communities in terms of health improvement , resource management capacity , and sustainable use of natural resources .  The key to its success will be in the ability to provide near - and long-term benefits that effect changes in the behaviour of individuals , communities and private companies , as well as in natural resource policies of both developed and developing country governments .  
The integration of women into the management of public affairs was therefore not only part of an economic policy strategy aimed at achieving integrated and sustainable development but was also consistent with a coherent and global perspective on human rights .  
Moreover , although UNDCP had assisted many Governments in drafting drug control laws , it remained to be seen whether those same Governments had provided the resources required to implement drug control programmes in an effective and sustainable manner and whether policies addressed drug abuse and illicit traffic in a balanced fashion , as the General Assembly had requested .  
Recognizing also that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , and fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements ,  
His delegation looked forward to the special session of the General Assembly for the review of Agenda 21 , which it hoped would provide policy guidelines in the critical areas of sustainable development and adopt measures to achieve sustainable development goals , in particular through the provision of adequate financial resources , the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the creation of institutional mechanisms . 
As established in Agenda 21 , the global partnership for sustainable development must be based on the transfer of new and additional resources to developing countries to meet their immense needs and enable them to achieve sustainable development .  
For example , the indicators of sustainable development , the impact of economic globalization on the global natural environment , the relationship between sustainable development and sustained economic growth and the monitoring of natural processes at the global level could be addressed under a separate item .  
The Programme believed that the international capital markets and the private sector played a vital role in the promotion of sustainable energy concepts , since total private sector investments in energy far outweighed all flows of official development assistance to the sector .  
The purpose of the special session should not be to renegotiate Agenda 21 or to redefine the principles and objectives of sustainable development , but rather to identify priority sectoral issues that required follow-up at the international level .  The outcomes of other United Nations conferences held since the Rio Conference should also be taken into account in order to avoid duplication of ongoing work or work which had already been implemented in other international forums .  
Human settlements played an essential role in sustainable development and must be an integral component of policies and programmes developed at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
The notion of sustainable human settlements must therefore be integrated more systematically both at the national level and within the United Nations system ; a dialogue must be established between civil society and its representatives , and cooperation among local Governments that had to resolve similar problems and between the various levels of government must be strengthened .  
That would be a fitting occasion for the submission of concrete proposals for ensuring that the new models of international cooperation would be translated effectively into reality , enabling sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , in particular the developing countries .  
The European Union had consistently emphasized its strong conviction that the Organization was uniquely well placed to advance international cooperation in the economic and social fields and to foster further progress towards the essential objective of international sustainable development .  Accordingly , the European Union was firmly committed to the multilateral approach to global problems ; it renewed its commitment to the United Nations and was prepared to equip it for the tasks of a new century .  
Second , the new global partnership must place economic cooperation for development at the centre of its attention ; although the global conferences of recent years had reached consensus about sustainable development , affirming that socio-economic development and environmental protection were complementary , it should not be forgotten that economic growth would always be the foundation and engine of sustainable development and , therefore , that efforts to help developing countries achieve sustained economic growth should be the core objective of international cooperation for development .  
Bolivia had participated actively in organizing a meeting of the Latin American countries at the level of Head of State and Government to be held in Santa Cruz de la Sierra , Bolivia , in December , at which the thrust of national and international actions for sustainable development would be defined , including economic , social and environmental goals , and the importance of obtaining new and additional resources for the financing of the plan of action to be adopted would be reaffirmed .  
While the Group of Seven recognized the crucial role played by the United Nations in organizing international cooperation for sustainable development and fostering consensus on development policies and goals , that recognition , though encouraging , would best be expressed through attainment of the agreed ODA targets and implementation of existing agreements and commitments .  
Up to 40 missions to Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , at their request and in cooperation with United Nations agencies and regional commissions , related to formulation of strategies that promote sustainable development , including financing of sustainable development , use of economic instruments and building relevant institutional capacities , including for monitoring and assessment , as well as related to the management of mineral , water and energy resources ; ( ii ) Training . 
The agenda for development , the first draft of which had been taken up by the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session , therefore demonstrated the desire of the international community to lay down rules at the global level for promoting sustainable and comprehensive development based on shared responsibilities .  
Three basic principles were embodied in the agenda : the multidimensional nature of the development process , encompassing such elements as sustainable economic growth , social justice , good governance and respect for human rights , including equal rights for women ; the need for an integrated approach at both the national and the international level , while ensuring their concomitance ; and the responsibility of each agent of development , giving priority to national action .  
She stressed the urgent need for the international community and the multilateral financial institutions to formulate strategies that would significantly reduce the debt stock to a sustainable or manageable level that would not impede the implementation of development programmes or deter investors .  
As the Council underlined , the essential prerequisite for the successful completion of peaceful reintegration is the full cooperation of the Government of Croatia , which bears the ultimate responsibility for convincing the local population that their reintegration is sustainable and that the process of reconciliation and return is irreversible .  
Leaders thanked the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands for his presentation on the Forum theme of reform , human values and togetherness and discussed how reforms aimed at achieving sustainable development should go beyond conventional economic dimensions to embrace the essentially holistic nature of the process , and took cognizance of the need for Pacific cultural values and norms to be the basic premise and foundation of this process and the work of regional institutions .  
Promote and co-operate in providing the necessary financial and technological resources for the sustainable management , conservation and enhancement , as appropriate , of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol , including biomass , forests and oceans as well as other terrestrial , coastal and marine ecosystems .  
Its purpose is above all to alert the public and world leaders to the role of the oceans in planetary survival , to the threats facing the oceans and to more peaceful and sustainable use of the oceans , as well as to suggest ways of strengthening the legal and institutional framework for ocean governance at the national , regional and global levels .  
With respect to economic concerns , the Commission is looking at how far contemporary economic theory can be applied to ocean management in the context of sustainable development , at the national , regional and global levels and is assessing the effectiveness of alternative policy instruments in improving the way humans treat the oceans .  
For module two , covering supply reduction , the main focus areas are : adoption of a balanced and integrated approach to drug control ; development activities aimed at structural factors ; coordinated subregional efforts based on similar legislation ; crop replacement efforts including promotion of sustainable agriculture ; reliable data for measuring opium poppy cultivation ; political support by Governments ; capacity-building and human resources development ; and collection of information on experiences in alternative development .  
A sustainable improvement in export performance requires not only productivity growth based on rising investment rates , but also policies that ensure that real wages do not increase faster than productivity growth , and that the exchange rate is maintained at a stable and competitive level .  
We equally recognize that sustainable development in coastal areas is dependent upon an adequate understanding of the interaction between natural assets and social and human capital .  
Without continued efforts at international cooperation , smaller countries and developing countries may never build up an adequate scientific and educational base for sustainable space technology and application programmes .  
At the World Summit , the international community acknowledged that the equal rights of girls and the equal participation of women in the social , cultural , economic and political life of societies is a prerequisite for successful and sustainable development .  
Given the demographic , economic and geographic constraints , small island developing States should consider a well educated , highly adaptable and environmentally conscious population and workforce as a central pillar of national sustainable development .  
Although industry is a major user of natural resources and a direct or indirect source of pollution and other environmental impacts , business and industry must remain a key partner in the common endeavour to achieve sustainable development .  
The effects of natural disasters and bad weather on agricultural production notwithstanding , hunger and the lack of sustainable agricultural development were not solely the result of chance but rather of human choices and poor decisions .  
Those that have not established such a body should take immediate action to ensure that a national mechanism for guiding and coordinating sustainable development policy be put in place and be given adequate status and resources for effective functioning .  
Chouinard ( Canada ) said that , with the year 2000 fast approaching , sustainable development continued to be the most vital issue facing mankind ; it required a concerted and long-term commitment from the international community . 
Despite considerable efforts , many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , do not yet possess a critical mass of trained personnel in specialized fields and in interdisciplinary approaches related to sustainable development .  
Those that have not established such a body should take immediate action to ensure that a national mechanism for guiding and coordinating sustainable development policy be put in place and given adequate status and resources for effective functioning .  
Given demographic , economic and geographic constraints , small island developing States should consider a well educated , highly adaptable and environmentally conscious population and workforce to be a central pillar of national sustainable development .  
Zimbabwe was endeavouring to achieve effective economic management , guided by policies aimed at generating sustainable growth , as a basis for improving the living conditions of the people , while continuing to address social inequalities and gender issues .  
Thus , solidarity was the precondition for a lasting solution to all crises political , economic and environmental that threatened international peace and stability and undermined the chances for genuine and sustainable development for all .  
Only effective and increased international cooperation could save developing nations from a deeper crisis and generate sustainable development , thereby enabling them to be true participants in the global partnership for development .  
The United Nations had a key role to play in the effective coordination and promotion of multilateral efforts and in the collective examination of lessons learned by countries which had applied the sustainable development model .  
The second stage would focus on major structural transformations of the national economy by promoting domestic production , thereby creating further opportunities for private business and favourable conditions for sustainable economic growth .  
This ongoing work programme has developed a working list of indicators of sustainable development , divided into four categories social , economic , environmental and institutional .  
Reaffirming the need to incorporate sustainable development strategies , since they are essential to achieving economic , social , and environmental goals in a balanced and complementary manner ,  
The devastating social , economic and environmental impact of anti-personnel mines and their detrimental effects on the creation of conditions conducive to sustainable development is well documented .  
The supremacy of law is a vital element in the containment of conflicts and the protection of civil , cultural , social , political and economic rights ; but it is also a prerequisite for sustainable development and stability .  
It was convinced that the adoption of appropriate economic policies and the committed participation of the industrialized countries and international financial institutions would make it possible to meet the challenges of sustainable development .  
They support exchanges and cooperation , including joint projects , in basic and applied scientific research as well as in areas of research and development with potential for the development of modern society and sustainable economic growth in the future .  
The transformation from emergency reconstruction to sustainable longer-term development also assumes continued political and economic stability , which provides a necessary , but not sufficient , basis for rapid growth , a key national objective .  
Thirdly , rather than providing temporary services for the poor , the main objective of IFAD is to develop viable and financially sustainable rural financial systems , especially for the very poor living in remote areas in many developing countries .  
The broad-based concept of partnership with all actors in civil society has been widely recognized as a key feature of the Habitat Agenda and for making human settlements sustainable in ecological , social and economic terms .  
The Inter-Parliamentary Union continued to provide strong and concrete support to the major international conferences or summit conferences organized by the United Nations to address issues relating to sustainable economic and social development .  
It adopted the Istanbul Declaration , in which the nations present endorsed the universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter for all and making human settlements safer , healthier and more liveable , equitable , sustainable and productive .  
The major cost required for the rental of transmission and distribution facilities ( $ 5,948,000 per biennium ) is a recurring cost calculated at commercial prices and as such is not sustainable within existing resources .  
It should be designed to meet critical urgent needs , as well as the long-term requirements essential for the development of a sustainable national / local capacity , when applicable .  
Before the crisis , economic orthodoxy had held that a current account deficit was acceptable and sustainable if it stemmed from investment as opposed to consumption and if it was a result of private sector activities .  
Most of the heavily indebted poor countries were in Africa , and the present reality was that increasing debt , combined with economic stagnation , proved that 10 years of structural adjustments were not sufficient to pave the way to sustainable economic growth .  
At the policy level , there is a lack of properly articulated policies on sustainable development , and very little or no integration of environmental dimensions in socio-economic policy planning at the national level , which makes it difficult to harmonize priorities at the regional and subregional levels , and to develop coherent and subregional programmes .  
Since sectoral approaches to coastal development have not proven effective in arresting its deterioration , the concept of integrated coastal area management ( ICAM ) has gained recognition in recent years as a comprehensive , ecosystem-based approach to sustainable development and environmental conservation .  
The Coastal Module Panel of GOOS has begun the design of optimal monitoring and forecasting systems for coastal seas , focusing on preserving healthy coastal environments , promoting sustainable use of resources , mitigating coastal hazards , and enabling safe and efficient marine operations .  
The development process requires a united vision if it is to be sustainable , and it requires joint responsibility on the part of the public and the private sectors to ensure continuity combined with the political stability that strengthens democratic governance .  
Energy plays a key role in achieving the economic , social and environmental objective of sustainable development , and the supply of energy must be secure and reliable .  
Firmly convinced of the environmental , economic , social and cultural importance of all types of forests , Liechtenstein supports all efforts aimed at establishing an international , legally binding , comprehensive and coherent instrument on sustainable forest management .  
Bangladesh has enacted laws for the protection of environment and set up Green Courts to handle violation of these laws , formulated the National Environment Management Action Plan , ratified almost all major international conventions , and established a national coordination mechanism for sustainable development a National Environmental Committee headed by the Prime Minister .  
In other words , it aimed at finding ways and means to strike a true balance between present and future economic , social and ecological needs on the one hand , and laying the foundations for a world partnership based on shared understanding of needs and interests with a view to attaining sustainable development on the other .  
We are particularly concerned that poverty continues unabated ; financial resources have taken a downturn ; the transfer of environmental technologies has not materialized ; human-induced climate change has increased ; trade and investments have become more difficult for developing countries ; and globalization has unleashed new threats to sustainable development .  
New and additional resources and environmentally sound technology were identified as the critical inputs for arresting worldwide environmental degradation and achieving sustained economic growth and the sustainable development of humankind .  
My country also highlighted the great importance of fostering sustainable development , whose objective is to harmonize human activities and nature by means of policies and actions that will achieve an efficient and fair economy , a just society and the preservation of the environment , in order to ensure a better quality of life for present and future generations in a safe environment .  
Reaffirming that the full implementation of the Platform for Action requires immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and , to that end , recognizing that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ,  
Ghana was convinced that sustainable development held the key to global peace , and therefore appreciated the Departments focus of raising the profile of the African continent in the media .  
IFF may wish to consider the success of CGIAR in mobilizing resources and achieving coherence for international efforts to address a shared global agenda in the field of agriculture and food security and to examine the potential of extending that model to address forest research to ensure sustainable forest management and to maintain adequate cover of all types of forest and other wooded lands to meet a variety of current and future human needs .  
To be most effective in achieving sustainable forest management , economic instruments should be designed with a specific policy objective in mind ; they should also be well integrated into the broader macroeconomic and multisectoral policy context .  
Success in using this tool to promote improved forest management will depend on the existence of mutually supportive and effective management institutions ; the political will to implement appropriate policies ( including regulation ) ; and physical parameters , such as the level of sustainable harvest and cost of production .  
Progress in achieving sustainable forest management will depend on effective integration and coordination of local , national , regional and international actions related to these topics in addition to main economic instruments , such as direct economic incentives ( subsidies and charges ) , tax policies , resource rent capture and regulation of land tenure .  
Additional information is needed on approaches that can be used to devise markets for forest products , and the role of the public and private sector in assuring that new or expanded markets are consistent with the social , economic and ecological components of sustainable forest management .  
Local , national and international policies must reflect an accurate understanding of the factors affecting demands on forests , and must reflect consistent , mutually supportive approaches to ensuring that efforts to meet these demands are consistent with sustainable forest management .  
However , there is currently no formal mechanism , at either the global or the regional level , to undertake a composite review of the compliance of forest-related obligations of existing instruments in a cohesive and comprehensive manner , and to assess their collective effectiveness in achieving sustainable forest management .  
This relates to the complex question of international and national transfers to internalize positive externalities by supporting forest-based sustainable livelihoods of the rural poor .  
Whatever the outcome on public funding arrangements , the essential role of the private sector in the productive , entrepreneurial aspects of sustainable forest management needs to be recognized , reinforced and promoted .  
There was a growing realization that business was not only about wealth creation but also about assuming social responsibilities for issues such as humans rights and sustainable human development , and that globalization and trade liberalization had had some unforeseen negative effects , including financial instability .  
With the increasing recognition of the importance of good governance , those instruments provide a foundation for promoting and maintaining the rule of law , a basic requisite for sustainable socio-economic development ; furnish a basis for Governments to assess their systems , formulate legislation and develop effective tools for controlling national and transnational forms of crime ; and provide a framework for technical assistance , which in turn serves as a catalyst for their implementation .  
Generally speaking , however , the current extent and types of protected areas , particularly in densely populated regions , are deemed insufficient to achieve sustainable forest management due to both internal and external factors .  
Encourage countries , with support from international organizations , to develop and implement polices which adequately value non-market forest benefits in economic terms ; recognize the real social and economic values of forest environmental services ; recognize native forests as a capital resource and invest accordingly in preventing their depletion ; seek to maintain overall biological diversity ; and ensure that harvests do not exceed ecologically sustainable levels ;  
The Panel recognized that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from research and development and from the commercial utilization of biological resources fell , inter alia , within the purview of the Convention .  
The Convention established , early on , a process to ensure that knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity were considered in all relevant sectoral and thematic areas in the implementation of the Convention .  
The principle of prior informed consent is also embedded in the wording of article 8 ( j ) , whereby , subject to national legislation , the wider application of the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity should only occur with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices . 
But implementation of these policies will have little impact on long _ term sustainable development , sound management of natural resources , or on the reduction of poverty and inequality unless accompanied by fundamental transformation of unjust economic and political structures both at national and global levels .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society , are an essential part of the foundations necessary for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
It made it more difficult for developing countries to make use of their traditional comparative advantages , such as cheap labour and abundant natural resources , since industrial and technological capacity with a solid infrastructural base , adequate human resources and business development were increasingly determinants of economic growth and sustainable development .  
A sustainable industrial policy was a crucial component of development strategies , which included a number of key objectives : open competitive economies , progressive trade liberalization , secure and productive employment , social development and environmental protection .  
The purpose of the OHCHR technical cooperation programme is to assist countries - including Governments and civil society - in promoting and protecting all human rights at the national and regional levels , through the incorporation of international human rights standards in national laws , policies and practices , and building a sustainable national capacity to implement these standards and ensure respect for human rights .  
We welcome the newly established international legally binding norm on an APLs ban as a pivotal step towards a sustainable response to the global humanitarian crisis caused by their indiscriminate use in various parts of the world .  
While the developing countries had utilized their own resources in order to achieve the basic objective of sustainable development , it was clear that those efforts would be inadequate without substantial support from the international community .  
There was no point in speaking of sustainable development when some countries members of the Forum faced the prospect of being submerged by the sea in the not too distant future , and atolls were being polluted by nuclear tests .  
Following completion of the work of the three inter-agency task forces established by ACC ( on basic social services for all , an enabling environment for economic and social development , and full employment and sustainable livelihoods ) and with input from the Inter-Agency Committee for Women and Gender Equality , an inter-agency workshop held in Turin , Italy in December 1997 established country-level arrangements for follow-up to the global conferences and summits .  
Realizing the multiple benefits of the sustainable management of forests and other wooded lands will require cross-sectoral policy harmonization within a country , taking into account transboundary , regional and global dimensions , as well as the productive , environmental and social functions of forests .  
It has been argued that many complex and cross-sectoral aspects of productive , economic and social development , as well as environmental protection , intersect in forests , so that how forests are managed , conserved and developed can be seen as a reality check for sustainable development .  
This consensus recognizes the wide diversity of social , economic , environmental , cultural and political conditions around the world and accordingly the need to develop appropriate diverse approaches towards sustainable forest management .  
In its final report , IPF emphasized that national inventories are an important basis for effective formulation of national forest programmes , and that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is central to sustainable forest management and a wide range of other considerations related to forests and forest ecosystems at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Discussions around financial resources in IPF and IFF have also included such issues as effective private sector involvement ; integration with national policies and priorities and effective coordination ; the application of economic instruments and tax policies ; the mobilization of national financial resources ; and the possibility of finding a mechanism to raise funds to establish a forest fund dedicated to support activities aimed at sustainable forest management .  
Shedding light on the above issues and focusing attention on the critical importance of building indigenous capacity and technological capabilities as indispensable inputs to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries was one of the objectives of the CSTD in convening the meeting of the Working Group .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
Feature formats will focus on peacekeeping , economic and social development , human rights , sustainable development , the advancement of women , the question of Palestine , environmental issues , international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , international drug trafficking , health , population and development , youth and issues of regional concern ( News and Media Division ) ; iv . 
Generally , small island developing States recognized the extremely vital and critical role of donor support in attaining the goals of the Programme of Action , and called on the international community not to judge their eligibility for concessional assistance solely by the indicator of per capita income , which ignores their fragility , vulnerability and inability to generate adequate national savings relative to the enormity of investment required for sustainable development .  
Along the same line , it was proposed that small island developing States need to adopt a programme approach instead of a project-by-project approach in sustainable development planning , and to mainstream projects and programmes into comprehensive integrated national sustainable development plans that incorporate the economic , social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
Donors called for the strengthening of small island developing States statistical capabilities so that they may develop suitable indicators of progress in sustainable development , in particular indicators for monitoring the performance of projects and programmes to ensure that external funding is effectively utilized and set targets are attained .  
The European Union recognized that external debt overhang remained a major obstacle to sustainable development in many poor developing countries and that solutions must continue to be sought to prevent the burden of debt service from offsetting the benefits of reforms in those countries and to ensure their access to financial markets .  
While promoting the uses of voluntary initiatives and agreements as positive instruments for sustainable development , trade unions will also promote the defining of minimum social , environmental and economic indicators that voluntary initiatives or agreements must never conflict with or undermine ( for example , minimum social indicators would include International Labour Organization ( ILO ) core labour standards , child and forced labour provisions , and employment equality requirements ) .  
While continuing to provide regional comparable statistics and indicators needed for assessing and monitoring progress achieved in sustainable development in the ESCWA region , during the biennium 20002001 , the subprogramme will concentrate on upgrading these services to better respond to the renewed and growing interest in statistics and indicators covering a wide range of economic , social and , for the first time , environmental concerns associated with sustainable development .

At its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly stated that while energy is essential to economic and social development and improved quality of life , sustainable patterns of production , distribution and use of energy are crucial . 
Furthermore , labour-intensive public works can be effective for creating employment and productive infrastructure not only in situations linked to war , natural disasters or economic emergencies but also in a variety of regular investment programmes which can provide sustainable employment to those working in agriculture or in the informal economy .  
Other related issues discussed included the need for Governments to place poverty eradication at the top of the national agenda ; the debt burden ; womens access to and control of productive assets , such as land and credit ; and enhancing the human capital of the poor by ensuring their access to basic health care , education , nutrition , productive employment and sustainable livelihoods .

To develop environmentally , socially and culturally compatible forms of tourism and to continue the development and implementation of voluntary initiatives in support of sustainable tourism development , bearing in mind that such forms of tourism and initiatives should meet , or preferably exceed , relevant local , national , regional or international standards ;  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
To undertake a comprehensive survey and assessment of the results of implementing existing voluntary initiatives and guidelines relating to the economic , sociocultural and environmental sustainability of tourism , to be reported to the Commission on Sustainable Development in order to identify best practices with respect to raising awareness of sustainable tourism development ;  
Actions were elaborated to target , inter alia , strengthening coordination between national and local support strategies and institutions ; strengthening institutional capacities for supporting small and medium enterprises in key agro-industrial subsectors ; and improving national capacities in the sustainable management of natural resources , with emphasis on the conservation of biodiversity and exploitation of its business opportunities .  
There remains a need to reconcile the widely divergent views held over the exercise of political power and the strategies for social and economic development , in order for there to be favourable prospects for political stability and sustainable institutional and economic development .  
UNDP resident representatives have played a key role in telling the complex story of sustainable human development to help to increase understanding of what UNDP stands for and to generate support for the organization .  
The Circle brings together experts , scholars , researchers and professionals from diverse academic backgrounds and intellectual traditions united by a common endeavour : working towards promoting a holistic concept of sustainable development that takes into account all its profound and complex dimensions .  
A UNIDO policy firmly aligned with the broad United Nations global agenda of sustainable human development and poverty reduction through UNIDOs programmatic focus on the three Es of sustainable industrial development : competitive Economy , productive Employment , and sound Environment , at the policy , institutional and enterprise level ;  
It is now widely recognized that the implementation of sustainable development schemes will have to be based on original and innovative approaches to the development process , where sharing must be an integral part of the support given by the industrialized world .  
It must therefore be concluded that sustainable , culturally appropriate and sociologically stable development can only be brought about when the educational processes required for development lead to professional outlets for those whose motivation for learning and development has a broader meaning than arrival at an often locally defined socio-economic status .  
The Social Summits commitment 3 , contained in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development1 stated that the heads of State and Government committed themselves to promoting the goal of full employment as a basic priority of our economic and social policies , and to enabling all men and women to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen productive employment and work .  
It is essential that this future body , whose governing board will comprise the various sectors of civil society involved and whose role will be of key importance in developing space sciences within the country and in familiarizing coming generations with the issues of sustainable socio-economic development , should be strengthened as from its establishment through the cooperation of Member States .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Promoting community development , improving access to security of land tenure , housing and basic services , and fully integrating people living in poverty into economic , social and political life , which are crucial to sustainable development ;  
Emphasizes the role of the international community and external assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition in improving the quality of information on the impact of urbanization on all aspects of sustainable development , in sharing of information on the use of economic instruments and in the transfer and dissemination of environmentally sound technology ;  
Believing that youth concerns should be dealt with using an integrated approach which should allow young people , who are designated key partners for the achievement of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in paragraphs 182 ( n ) , 120 ( a ) and 120 ( b ) of the Habitat Agenda , 1 to participate fully on local , national , regional and international levels ,  
Many delegations cited specific examples of how local authorities and non-governmental organizations were being strengthened and actively involved in policies and programmes to achieve adequate shelter and sustainable development of human settlements in their respective countries .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
In this statement , ACC underscored that the concept of sustainable development provided an over-arching policy framework for the entire spectrum of United Nations system-wide activities at the global , regional and country levels ( para . 2 ) , and called for the implementation of interrelated policies promoting economic development , improved social equity and environmental sustainability .  
In pursuance of that effort , ECA has produced several major studies on the following subjects : strategic framework on regional integration and subregional cooperation ; rethinking development in Central Africa in the twenty-first century ; making regional integration the engine for sustained growth and sustainable development at the national level ; programme for relaunching regional integration in the Central African subregion ; and renewing ECCAS : 19992001 .  
An entire new cluster of WHO technical programmes has also been established to promote health in the context of sustainable human development , including a renewed emphasis on reducing malnutrition and improving management of environmental risks to human health , integrating health dimensions into poverty reduction programmes and protecting vulnerable populations in situations of crisis and post-crisis ; promoting the synergy between health and human rights constitutes an additional priority .  
Underscores that sustainable development depends upon a healthy local , national , regional and global environment and that the United Nations Environment Programme has a major role to play in promoting actions at all levels that are designed to sustain the continued adequate functioning of ecological systems ;  
UNDPs second country programme for St . Helena ( 19931996 ) focused on developing national capacities in two areas : ( a ) sustainable livelihoods ; and ( b ) ensuring social protection throughout the transition from an aid-dependent economy dominated by the public sector to a self-financing economy , in which the private sector has an expanded role .  
The Group of Experts observed that in the context of the evolving international economic environment and globalization , it has become necessary to explore ways and means , particularly in the international taxation area , to provide an enabling environment for expansion of international trade and capital movements across national boundaries to promote financial resource mobilization for the achievement of sustainable economic growth .  
The Group of Experts was aware that an efficient and effective revenue administration can help developing countries and transitional economies to mobilize additional revenue resources and achieve greater financial self-reliance in facilitating and achieving sustainable economic development .  
There is a real threat that it may become an epoch in which the unmitigated promotion of increased international trade , investment and finance at the expense of the observance and protection of fundamental human rights and sustainable human development ( SHD ) is adopted as a mantra guiding many Governments and development economists as was amply demonstrated in the MAI process .  
In the broad context of international development issues , Agenda 211 emphasized that sustainable economic growth and development can not be achieved without taking measures to reduce losses from natural disasters , further considering the close linkages between disaster losses and environmental degradation .  
In this era of heightened financial volatility , the importance of sound macroeconomic fundamentals has become paramount : a sustainable fiscal position and current-account balance , a low or moderate rate of inflation , and consistency between the rate of inflation and the exchange rate are indispensable for any economy , as all economies are open ( albeit to different degrees ) .  
This programme aims at defining , developing and implementing a dedicated operational end-to-end satellite remote sensing capacity to provide real-time access to appropriate spatial data for supporting sustainable forest management at the subnational level .  
To ensure an enabling political , social and economic environment designed to create the best conditions for the eradication of poverty and for durable peace , based on full and equal participation of women and men , which is most conducive to achieving sustainable food security for all ;  
To pursue participatory and sustainable food , agriculture , fisheries , forestry and rural development policies and practices in high and low potential areas , which are essential to adequate and reliable food supplies at the household , national , regional and global levels , and combat pests , drought and desertification , considering the multifunctional character of agriculture ;  
To promote optimal allocation and use of public and private investments to foster human resources , sustainable food , agriculture , fisheries and forestry systems , and rural development , in high and low potential areas ;  
Intensify efforts to implement legislative and administrative measures as well as to promote public education , with special attention to youth , about the need for sustainable production and consumption patterns ; foster sustainable natural resource use ; and work concertedly to prevent environmental degradation within their countries ;  
Led by Ms . Gro Harlem Bruntland , of Norway , the Commission put forward in its 1987 report to the General Assembly the concept of sustainable development , an alternative approach to one based solely on economic growth - one " which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs " .  
Publicizing the work of the United Nations by developing and coordinating the implementation of global information campaigns on major thematic issues in the fields of economic and social development , sustainable development , women and human rights ; peacekeeping , peacemaking and humanitarian activities ; and Palestinian rights and decolonization ;  
Intensify efforts to implement legislative and administrative measures as well as to promote public education , with special attention to youth , about the need for sustainable production and consumption patterns ; foster sustainable natural resource use ; and work concertedly to prevent environmental degradation within their countries ;  
We understand sustainable development as a comprehensive and complex process with the objective of improving the quality of life for the whole population through productive growth , social development with equity and full participation by citizens under the precepts of conservation of natural resources and preservation of environmental quality .  
The importance that the Government of Bolivia attaches to population matters is reflected in its comprehensive plan for economic and social development , which , under the concept of sustainable development , cross-cuts the areas of population , gender and generational and ethnic matters and highlights reproductive health as a matter of government policy .  
A strategy has been implemented on the basis of the principles of sustainable human development , the continued growth in acquiring new knowledge , culture , the spirit of invention and popular participation through the establishment of an organized , stable and strong society with transparent and efficient institutions .  
The implementation of this strategy has yielded tangible progress in understanding the situation of our population , which is indispensable for adjusting demographic trends and certain social behaviours that are not conducive to sustainable human development .  
It is therefore of utmost importance to recognize that responses to those changing circumstances and the achievement of sustainable development and social progress will require increased solidarity and exchange of ideas and information expressed through appropriate multilateral programmes and strengthened international cooperation .  
The Cairo Programme of Action , which was the outcome of a delicate compromise made in the face of diverse and even diverging cultural , religious and philosophical values , is the expression of our common will to go beyond diversity and seek together relevant responses to the challenges of sustainable development from the perspective of population , which is certainly the most powerful factor determining the economic and social progress of nations . 
Decisive action at the national and international levels will determine whether these consequences will be either a downward spiral of increased poverty and environmental degradation or the achievement of sustainable development and improved quality of life for our people .  
From this point of view , we believe it imperative for the international community to facilitate the promotion of a supportive economic environment , particularly for developing countries in their effort to eradicate poverty and achieve sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development , as agreed at the International Conference on Population and Development .  
My country attached the utmost importance to the Cairo Conference , both in its own right and as a part of a global strategy for the promotion of sustainable development , which takes into account the recognized linkages between population , environmental protection and economic and social development .  
These objectives include economic development , poverty eradication , sustainable population growth , universal access to comprehensive reproductive health services , reduction in infant and maternal mortality and universal access to primary education , with special attention to closing the gender gap .  
It stresses the importance of sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development , acknowledging the responsibility of the developed countries in the international pursuit of sustainable development and continued efforts to promote sustained economic growth and to narrow imbalances in a manner that can benefit all countries , especially the developing ones .  
In its resolution 1999 / 4 of 7 May 1999 , the Economic and Social Council decided to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti to submit recommendations to the Council , at its substantive session of 1999 , on how to ensure that the assistance of the international community in supporting the Government of Haiti to achieve sustainable development is adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
Much has yet to be done in order to ensure that ongoing and future international assistance in support of the Government of Haiti for achieving sustainable development continues to be adequate and coherent , and that the main problems related to the coordination and effectiveness of the assistance are addressed .  
It further asserts that it is mindful of the harmful environmental impact of weapons of mass destruction and that it has constantly urged that the environment should be protected , that it should not be damaged and that its effective contribution to the achievement of sustainable development should not be impaired .  
At the same time , it is vital that such commitment by the parties be reinforced by political will and consistent , effective and determined support from the international community to guarantee the achievement of sustainable peace , including through its contributions of long-term assistance for development and trade .  
Without success in this area it is hardly possible to create the stable , just and democratic political environment which in turn is an indispensable precondition for sustainable human , economic and social development .  
At the same time , it is vital that such commitments by the parties be reinforced by political will and consistent , effective and determined support from the international community to guarantee the achievement of sustainable peace , including through its contributions of long-term assistance for development and trade .  
In this phase , it is expected that there will be intensive efforts to build , and where possible restore , basic economic structures , such as payments systems , public finances and hard budget constraints , so as to promote economic and social development as well as to make donor assistance efforts effective and sustainable .  
The main applications of this technology are to be found in the following fields : air and marine navigation , telecommunications , economic and social development , national capacity-building in formulating strategies geared to sustainable development and in solving problems in the fields of health and education , in the environmental sphere and in the areas of prevention and disaster relief .  
The Commission had subsequently identified four areas for future analytical work and expert meetings : ( a ) the respective roles of government and the private sector and the interactions between them in SME development ; ( b ) inter-firm cooperation ; ( c ) SME clustering and networking ; and ( d ) the provision of sustainable financial and non-financial services for SME development .  
While there is increasing recognition in most developing countries of the need to use such high technology input in support of sustainable development and of developmental activities , interestingly there are two interrelated issues to be addressed : firstly , promoting the technology itself and the associated problems encountered and , secondly , effective utilization of the high technology knowledge , once acquired , for sustainable development activities .  
To ensure that the programme is effective and sustainable in the face of increasing demands for technical assistance , a small increase in internal resources , equivalent to three man-months per year , will be needed for the specific purposes outlined in paragraph 79 above .  
Reiterating that the promotion of economic growth and sustainable development can not be achieved without adequate measures to prevent and reduce the impact of natural disasters and that there are close linkages between losses owing to natural disasters and environmental degradation , as emphasized in Agenda 21-3 / and in the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , 4 / adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session ,  
Reiterating in that regard that natural disasters damage the social and economic infrastructure of all countries , although the long _ term consequences of natural disasters are especially severe for developing countries , including the least developed countries , and landlocked and small island developing States , as well as for countries with economies in transition , thus hampering their sustainable development processes ,  
Following on the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa ( S / 1998 / 318 ) , the Council addressed this question last year in its resolution 1208 ( 1998 ) which , in unequivocal terms , called on all concerned to respect the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and condemned the use of such camps by combatants for the furtherance of military aims .  
Without continued efforts at international cooperation , however , smaller and many developing countries may find it difficult to never build up an adequate scientific and educational base for sustainable space technology and application programmes .  
In that regard , UNISPACE III takes special note of the initiative taken by the Integrated Global Observing Strategy Partnership to link users and providers of satellite - and surface-based data about the Earth and to foster the development of information products that increase scientific understanding and guide early warning , policy-setting and decision-making for sustainable development and environmental protection .  
In that regard , UNISPACE III takes special note of the initiative taken by the Integrated Global Observing Strategy Partnership to link users and providers of satellite-and surface-based data about the Earth and to foster the development of information products that increase scientific understanding and guide early warning , policy-setting and decision-making for sustainable development and environmental protection .  
Such activities are intended to promote energy efficiency and demand-side management ; clean energy technologies ; more widespread development and application of renewable energy technologies ; improved access to modern energy services by rural populations ; capacity-building and institutional development ; energy sector planning and management to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of sustainable development ; and the promotion of environmentally sound energy technologies .  
In other words , it should encompass the so-called 3 Es developed by the Director-General in connection with the 16 integrated service modules directed towards the long-term goals of sustainable industrial developmentnamely , competitive economy , productive employment and sound environment ( see document IDB . 21 / 10 , part one , p .  12 ) .  
It was worth noting that the decision had been taken by the Netherlands Embassy in Ethiopia , in close consultation with the Ethiopian authorities , since development experts in the field had concluded that UNIDOs new approach could make a difference at local level , and that the integrated programme would help to promote sustainable industrial development .  
His countrys scientific and technological potential and its understanding of the need for coordination with similar activities in Western Europe made it an excellent base for the setting up of a mechanism to enhance the effectiveness of institutions in Central and Eastern Europe in formulating programmes and projects geared to achieving environmentally sustainable development .  
The public and private sectors , civil society and NGOs had participated , together with UNIDO , in the design of that programme , whose implementation was of great importance for the countrys social , political and economic stability , sustainable industrial development being a key factor in creating a more prosperous and equitable society .  
Recalling that small island developing States are recognized as a special case for both environment and development because they are ecologically fragile and vulnerable , [ and because they face particular constraints in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ] [ and because their specific physical circumstances often create difficulties in benefiting from global economic development and thus achieving sustainable development ] ,  
Call on the international community to provide effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , in accordance with chapter 33 of Agenda 21 , to support small island developing States [ , in particular the least developed amongst them ] in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ;  
At the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , the international community reiterated its recognition of the specific constraints faced by small island developing States and the need for particular support in their efforts to advance sustainable development due to their small size and remoteness , ecological fragility , vulnerability to climate change and economic vulnerabilities .  
Strengthening of national capacity for the development of a methodology or guidelines for sound practices and techniques suitable for small island developing States , for achieving the integrated management and sustainable development of the coastal and marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , building on existing experience in that area ;  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
Renewed commitment by small island developing States to the completion of national sustainable development strategies , and also , as appropriate , of subregional and regional strategies , ideally before the target date of 2002 as agreed at the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held in 1997 , so as to enable implementation to be put in place as soon as possible ;  
At its sixth session , the Commission recalled that a vulnerability index that takes account of the constraints arising from small size and environmental fragility , as well as the incidence of natural disasters on a national scale , and the consequent relationship of those constraints to economic vulnerability , would assist in defining the vulnerability of small island developing States and in identifying the challenges to their sustainable development .  
In addition to improving coordination , United Nations system agencies should be more proactive in seeking the views of small island developing States across the full range of sustainable development issues in order to ensure that they take due account of both national differences and local sensitivities , in particular , sensitivities in relation to such areas as traditional knowledge and the special place of local and indigenous communities . 
The Commission had subsequently identified four areas for future analytical work and expert meetings : ( a ) the respective roles of government and the private sector and the interactions between them in SME development ; ( b ) inter-firm cooperation ; ( c ) SME clustering and networking ; and ( d ) the provision of sustainable financial and non-financial services for SME development .  
Such action is needed in order to enhance international and regional security ; reduce the risk of armed conflict , political violence , terrorism and violent crime ; combat and suppress the illicit trafficking in small arms ; promote sustainable peace settlements and good governance ; and , above all , stop human suffering . 
Moreover , the joint UNDP / UNCTAD Programme on Globalization , Liberalization and Sustainable Human Development , which was initiated in 1998 , supports the development of a conceptual and analytical framework articulating globalization and sustainable human development and the strengthening of the negotiation capacities of poor countries , to enable them to participate better in the negotiations of multilateral trade , investment and financial agreements .  
On this basis , I am confident that an appropriate mechanism will be found to meet the aspirations of the Government of Haiti as well as the desire of the international community to elaborate a long-term , coordinated and well-managed plan for Haiti 's sustainable social , economic and institutional development .  
It reads : To play a leading role in advancing comprehensive and sustainable human development through the enhanced participation of Jordanians , the Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development strives to impact best development practices at the national level , drawing on its experience and local presence , while creating opportunities and expanding the choices of Jordanians to play a central role in the process of shaping the countrys future . 
Whether initiating or sponsoring research , training and education on the United Nations and United Nations reform , on the Great Lakes region of Africa , on early conflict warning and prevention , on disarmament , the status of women , racism and racial discrimination , human rights and sustainable development and environmental protection , WFUNA remains committed to examining the critical issues before the United Nations and to help find solutions that will shape our common future .  
Generally , small island developing States recognized the extremely vital and critical role of donor support in attaining the goals of the Programme of Action , and called on the international community not to judge their eligibility for concessional assistance solely by the indicator of per capita income , which ignores their fragility , vulnerability and inability to generate adequate national savings relative to the enormity of investment required for sustainable development .  
Along the same line , it was proposed that small island developing States need to adopt a programme approach instead of a project-by-project approach in sustainable development planning , and to mainstream projects and programmes into comprehensive integrated national sustainable development plans that incorporate the economic , social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
Donors called for the strengthening of small island developing States statistical capabilities so that they may develop suitable indicators of progress in sustainable development , in particular indicators for monitoring the performance of projects and programmes to ensure that external funding is effectively utilized and set targets are attained .  
The Central American Governments must also contend with regional disparities among their countries in terms of human development , economic performance and their respective political and legal frameworks , all of which are obstacles to achieving integrated and sustainable arrangements for economic growth and stable political processes .  
During the past year , the priorities of ALIDES have been advanced through a wide range of initiatives and meetings at various levels of government , encompassing the social sector , public finance and economic growth , environmental protection and sustainable development , and the strengthening of SICA and other regional institutions as a means of pursuing the goals of ALIDES .  
The UNDP policy document entitled Integrating human rights with sustainable human development embraces a holistic vision integrating all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
A policy framework that integrates macroeconomic , financial , structural , social and human issues is imperative if there is to be equitable and sustainable development .  
Ensuring access to basic social services for the unreached , the vulnerable and the most disadvantaged members of society is not only morally imperative but also economically rational , eradicating the worst manifestation of poverty and laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and productivity gains in the future .  
Given IMOs global regulatory mandate , which encompasses the development of international rules and standards designed to enhance the safety of life at sea and protect the marine environment from pollution caused by ships , the twin fundamentals of sustainable development and poverty alleviation have evolved in recent years as parallel concerns to the Organization .  
Complying with UNIDOs commitment in the position paper to treat industrialization as an effective means of accelerating growth essential to rapid economic and social development , the research wing of the organization prepared a few concept papers , focusing on the crucial role of agro-industry in income generation and employment creation contributing to sustainable livelihood patterns .  
The Seminar was also to review the political , economic and social conditions in the small island Non-Self-Governing Territories and to identify areas in which the international community could increase and enhance its participation in the programmes of assistance and adopt a comprehensive and integrated approach to ensure the political and sustainable socio-economic development of the Territories concerned .  
At the second Consultative Group Meeting for the Reconstruction and Transformation of Central America , co-hosted by the Inter-American Development Bank and the Government of Sweden and held in Stockholm , from 25 to 28 May 1999 , the Governments of the region , the principal donors and civil society representatives renewed their commitment to democratic change and sustainable human development as the best means of reducing social and ecological vulnerability to future disasters .  
The Central American Governments must also contend with regional disparities between their countries in terms of human development , economic performance and their respective political and legal frameworks , all of which are obstacles to achieving integrated and sustainable arrangements for economic growth and stable political processes .  
One of the key aspects of operational activities for development is facilitating the transfer of technology and expanding the access to technological information , and the creation of information flows on affordable and sustainable technology which is suitable to a specific country , establishing information networks with relevant institutions and business firms .  
The independent expert welcomed the decision of the Economic and Social Council , contained in its resolution 1998 / 4 of 7 May 1999 , to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti that would submit recommendations to the Council on how to ensure that international community assistance to the efforts to support the Government of Haiti in achieving sustainable development is adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
This common approach both preventive and reactive is comprised of multiple and coordinated international , regional and national efforts that contribute to sustainable peace in areas prone or affected by conflict .  
Moreover , the special combination of inputs technical assistance and emergency supplies on the one hand and materials for construction and water equipment on the other ( benefiting approximately 110,000 people ) has made possible the implementation of an integrated emergency and rehabilitation programme whose overall objective is to facilitate a smooth and sustainable transition from emergency to development , through effective and direct involvement of the beneficiaries themselves . 
The favourable response with which the United Nations system and other governmental and non-governmental organizations greeted the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa led us to believe that the international community would , in a meaningful way , join in the activities undertaken by Africa to resolve conflicts , consolidate democracy and ensure economic and social development .  
An enabling political environment conducive to human rights , good governance and a vibrant civil society are essential for sustainable development .  
Well over a year ago , the Secretary-General outlined in an earlier report recommendations that , if pursued by the international community with adequate political will , would have advanced the course of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa beyond its current stage . 
With the acceleration in the pace of globalization in the early 1990s came the expectation that growth and development based on global market forces would be more rapid , more sustainable and more widely shared than in the past , allowing developing countries to narrow the gap with industrial countries and the poorest sections of society to close the income gap with the rich . 
As the principal forum of the United Nations for the integrated treatment of development and interrelated issues in the areas of trade , finance , investment , technology and sustainable development , UNCTAD is expected to make a substantial contribution to the pursuit of the international communitys common development objectives .  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Provision of advisory services to 16 countries for the development of legislative proposals to implement selected environmental agreements that address identified environmental and sustainable development issues ( through national task forces , consultants , technical backstopping and national consensus-building forums ) ;

Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Stability and efficiency of the national as well as regional financial markets , increased domestic savings and optimal allocation of resources are a sound basis for sustainable economic growth .  
It is therefore important that developing countries , when implementing economic reforms , increasing export competitiveness and building a favourable investment climate , are placed in a position that allows them to carry out such tax , social , environmental and regulatory policies , which are critical in terms of sustainable development .  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Recognizing that mutually supportive efforts at the national and international levels are imperative in the pursuit of sustainable development , which includes , inter alia , the provision of financial resources and the transfer of technology for the application of cost-effective energy systems and wider use of environmentally friendly , renewable energies ,  
Encourages the Secretary-General to make efforts to promote public awareness activities in all Member States , with the support of international , regional and national institutions , both public and private , regarding the strategic importance of the Global Renewable Energy Education and Training Programme 1996-2005 in attaining the objective of sustainable development ;  
In that regard , foreign direct investment , technical assistance for national capacity-building and export outlets were but a few of the indispensable conditions for the participation of the South in world trade .  Vigorous and sustainable economic growth , which could greatly foster employment and poverty eradication efforts , was vital .  
The UNITAR Fellowship Programme on the Legal Aspects of Debt and Financial Management has been developed to meet a need in providing training to public officials from sub-Saharan Africa in the various legal aspects of debt management with a view to developing sustainable capacity for the efficient management of international debt .  
Economic growth was strongly correlated with poverty alleviation , and thus the most useful approach lay in the creation of a sound macroeconomic foundation for sustainable growth , with open markets , transparent regulatory systems , strong financial oversight and participatory decision-making .  
Greater access to the markets of industrialized countries , international financial stability and technological cooperation on an equitable and sustainable basis were indispensable to improving the conditions of developing countries in the era of globalization .  
Core elements of a new poverty eradication strategy should include a broadly based understanding of the mechanisms of sustainable poverty reduction ; the selection of those public interventions that would have the largest impact on the poor and reduce their vulnerability by reducing income volatility resulting from global and domestic shocks and natural disasters ; and the establishment of outcome indicators .  
ILO encouraged employment policies based on economic growth , enhanced opportunities for lifelong learning and training , flexible job planning to extend working lives , and innovative and sustainable social security and pension policies .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
National , regional and international efforts to find solutions to economic and social problems and to resolve conflicts must be increased if women were to be effectively involved in sustainable national development .  
While his delegation believed that the role of civil society was crucial for the effective realization of sustainable development goals , it would caution against those who sought to have the Commissions process duplicate or otherwise unduly influence issues and negotiations on matters better left in the forums where they were more appropriately addressed .  
His delegation stood behind the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States and recognized the many pressing issues that bore upon the small island States progress towards sustainable development , including the public health and economic effects of global warming , the conservation of fish stocks and the strain that increased tourism placed on local infrastructure .  
It had developed a legislative framework for environmental protection and a national concept of sustainable development , and was working on legal , administrative and economic instruments to ensure sustainable development .  
Progress towards sustainable development required the establishment of an international legal framework for managing deteriorating natural resources , enhanced coordination among international institutions in the environmental field , global guidance for the emerging environmental agenda and the pursuit of feasible solutions for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
This policy should include , as a minimum , culmination of the process of adapting the substantive and procedural legal framework to the requirements of international norms governing collective bargaining and trade union freedom , and the review of State institutions in order to ensure that the planning process throughout the country will include educational , preventive and promotional dimensions , with the necessary budgetary appropriation to make them sustainable .  
As regards education and health , in addition to the twin challenges of continuing to expand coverage and ensure that the amount of money actually spent is no less than the amount budgeted , there is the challenge of making sure that the new schemes for the provision of services are sustainable and that the quality of services is improved , inter alia by ensuring that they are better tailored to the multicultural and multilingual characteristics of Guatemalan society .  
His Governments long-term sustainable development strategies were aimed at upgrading the living standard of the citizens of Fiji , eradicating poverty , empowering women and youth , increasing employment and protecting the environment , in particular from land degradation and the trans-shipment of hazardous and toxic material across the oceans .

The Caribbean region and sea possessed a number of unique features which justified according them priority attention : exceptional biological diversity , highly fragile ecosystems and heavy reliance by most of the countries of the region on the coastal land and marine environment in order to achieve sustainable development .  
The relationship between the environment and mankind had been discussed at Rio , where it had been recognized that States had common but differentiated responsibilities and that sustainable development required adequate scientific , technical and financial resources .  
Regrettably , the United Nations system continued to face constraints already addressed in earlier sustainable development efforts , including lack of financial and human resources , lack of institutional capacity , and vague mandates and roles of agencies , as mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report ( A / 54 / 131 ) .  
In accordance with article 19 of the Convention , there was an urgent need to consider modalities for advance informed agreement outlining appropriate procedures in the field of safe transfer , handling and use of any a living modified organism resulting from biotechnology that might have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
Even though it was true that primary responsibility for the implementation of Agenda 21 lay with each individual country , it was also true that international cooperation was an important complementary factor in taking advantage of the real benefits of sustainable development .  
The Council reaffirms its resolve and determination to face the challenges and to overcome them with a deep sense of faith in God and an unshakeable confidence in the capability and potential of its people and of their union to achieve their hopes and aspirations for a resplendent future of comprehensive , sustainable development safeguarded by social justice and abounding in prosperity and growth .

The main thrust of Namibias national action programme to combat decertification was that the social , economic , legal and political environment should be reconciled with the natural environment in order to enhance the sustainable use of natural resources .  
The first principle was the necessity to preserve outer space exclusively for peaceful uses and to promote international cooperation in the use of outer space for such purposes , taking into account the imperative of achieving continued economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular developing countries .  
Safety and security are basic human rights and essential to economic development , therefore it is imperative that scarce resources be invested in programmes likely to protect such rights in a responsible and sustainable way .  
The basic aim of integration of our countries at the present stage is to complete the creation of a Customs Union as a prerequisite for boosting our national economies , raising the standard of living of our peoples and achieving sustainable democratic development .

May I conclude my statement by expressing my conviction that , in order to increase life expectancy , improve health-care indicators and the quality of social life , and successfully confront the very specific problems of older persons , it is crucial to have an international economic order that is just , fair and sustainable and makes it possible for these challenges to be met , regardless of the difficulty of surrounding circumstances .  
In conclusion , may I express my delegation ' s sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Summit will help generate the renewed political will at the national and international levels that is so needed to attain the noble objectives of sustainable human development .  
In the four years since the Summit , the developing countries have enjoyed little in the way of the technical and financial cooperation for development that was committed and certainly they have not engaged the path to rapid , broad-based sustainable development.It is in fact somewhat difficult to undertake a review of progress made in follow-up activities when the economic picture today is bleaker than it was at the time of the Summit .  
Let me refer to the European Union Common Position of 2 December 1996 , and reiterate on this occasion that the main objective of the European Union in its relations with Cuba is to encourage a process of gradual and peaceful transition to pluralistic democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people .  
Continued financial assistance from the international community for the Bethlehem 2000 project is needed for the creation of a strong , self-sufficient and sustainable economic infrastructure for Bethlehem that would provide a sound underpinning for social and political stability , which is a prerequisite for peace in the region .  
Factors that have a direct or indirect impact on peace , such as the environment , natural resources , sustainable development , quality of life , technology and international relations , are studied in terms of their real impact on peace and not as isolated topics .  
In a world still governed by a narrow realism , sometimes sterile but always destructive , it is clear that those who envisage a better future for humanity will have much to do to definitively set in motion the dynamic of change that is so necessary for sustainable human development .  
In my delegation ' s view , the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is a fundamental means of ensuring the peaceful and sustainable use and development of the oceans and their resources , through , in particular , the promotion of international cooperation , the equitable and efficient utilization and preservation of living marine resources , and the protection and preservation of the marine environment .  
Hence , gaining a growing number of adherents across cultural , social and economic lines , democracy is increasingly being recognized as an appropriate response to a wide range of human concerns , and as an ingredient for both sustainable development and lasting peace .  
The Fourth Committee welcomed the outcome of the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , held in Vienna from 19 to 30 July 1999 , and it endorsed the practical benefits and potential offered in all areas of human activity by space technology , the peaceful application of which can contribute to increasing the quality of live and to sustainable economic and social development .  
An enabling political environment conducive to human rights , good governance and a vibrant civil society are essential for sustainable development .  
This fact has always prompted us to restate the principle of full respect for the delicate balance between the major organs of the international Organization as set out in the Charter , in particular the inherent role of the General Assembly in considering principles of cooperation aimed at relieving human suffering , including addressing the causes of conflict and the strengthening of lasting peace and sustainable development .  
An integral part of promoting sustainable human development is respect for all social and economic rights , as well as cultural , civil and political rights .  
Notwithstanding the difficult economic and social conditions existing in many African countries and the environmental and desertification-related problems , the continent is doing all it can to create conditions for sustained economic growth and sustainable development in Africa .  
Iraq was one of the pioneers in adopting organized scientific planning to mobilize and develop human and financial resources so as to achieve sustainable economic growth aimed at bringing about the prosperity of human beings and at maintaining their right to their natural resources and their environmental rights .  
However , it is always worth remembering that sustainable development is conditional upon a rapid stabilization of the worlds population , which keeps on growing , particularly in the poor countries , where growth rates are highest , and requires , despite the progress that has been made in the last five years , the mobilization of sufficient resources from the international community , and from the donor countries in particular , to enable the poor countries to overcome their financial limitations . 
In 1994 , at the historic International Conference on Population and Development the largest intergovernmental conference on population and development ever held we pledged our collective efforts to addressing the critical challenges and interrelationships between population and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development .  
What we all have in common is the wish and the request of peoples to have a better standard of living than they had in the past , real sustainable development and sustained growth in their countries and for their human rights and freedoms to be fully protected and observed .  
This clearly shows how we intend to move forward in our future efforts and that we are serious about seeking to complement social and economic policy with sustainable development initiatives.A concrete proposal which we are currently pursuing is the idea that the outer island health centres should have solar-power electricity .  
Recalling that small island developing States are recognized as a special case for both environment and development because they are ecologically fragile and vulnerable , and because they face particular constraints in their efforts to achieve sustainable development and because their specific physical circumstances often create difficulties in benefiting from global economic development and thus achieving sustainable development ,  
At the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , the international community reiterated its recognition of the specific constraints faced by small island developing States and the need for particular support in their efforts to advance sustainable development due to their small size and remoteness , ecological fragility , vulnerability to climate change and economic vulnerabilities .  
Strengthening of national capacity for the development of a methodology or guidelines for sound practices and techniques suitable for small island developing States , for achieving the integrated management and sustainable development of the coastal and marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , building on existing experience in that area ;  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
Renewed commitment by small island developing States to the completion of national sustainable development strategies , and also , as appropriate , of subregional and regional strategies , ideally before the target date of 2002 as agreed at the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held in 1997 , so as to enable implementation to be put in place as soon as possible ;  
At its sixth session , the Commission recalled that a vulnerability index that takes account of the constraints arising from small size and environmental fragility , as well as the incidence of natural disasters on a national scale , and the consequent relationship of those constraints to economic vulnerability , would assist in defining the vulnerability of small island developing States and in identifying the challenges to their sustainable development .  
In addition to improving coordination , United Nations system agencies should be more proactive in seeking the views of small island developing States across the full range of sustainable development issues in order to ensure that they take due account of both national differences and local sensitivities , in particular , sensitivities in relation to such areas as traditional knowledge and the special place of local and indigenous communities .  
I have a clear duty also to insist that the intellectual debate on how to strengthen the sustainable development prospects for a uniquely fragile and vulnerable group of countries is informed by the most current thinking , produced by those who fully understand the complex circumstances of the countries for which they prescribe solutions .  
We believe that the Barbados Programme of Action , which calls for actions to be implemented at the national , regional and international levels , provides for an integrated and comprehensive basis for the sustainable development of small island developing States .  
Mr . Snijders ( Suriname ) : Before the Rio Conference and the adoption of Agenda 21 , successive Governments and the people of the Republic of Suriname , 90 per cent of which is covered by tropical rainforest , were able to recognize the need to pursue sustainable economic development , while at the same time safeguarding the environment.Thus they recognized their moral obligation to conserve the rainforest and a sound environment for future generations .  
Following the adoption of Agenda 21 and the Barbados Programme of Action , the Government of Suriname acknowledged the necessity of strengthening its capacity for the sustainable management of its natural resources through , inter alia , the creation of appropriate institutional mechanisms to design and enforce sound environmental policies capable of countering the pressures and challenges arising from the promotion of economic development .  
The United Nations Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , held in Barbados in 1994 , was aware of the enormous challenges facing these States when it adopted the Programme of Action , now considered the starting point for the sustainable development of small island developing States , whose ability to protect themselves against natural disasters is indeed limited .  
They also take into account our national priorities in such fields as social development strategies for the twenty-first century , health and environment in the context of sustainable development , development of human resources in the field of meteorology , proper management of water resources , integrated environmental management against pollution caused by industrial activity , protection of the atmosphere and the enhancement of the capacity of the States environmental research centre .  
These factors do indeed have a key role to play in terms of successful and sustainable development , and it goes without saying that human and institutional capacities are a prerequisite for addressing environmental , economic and social issues in the decision-making process simultaneously . 
The United Nations system itself must continue to play the role of catalyst and stimulant in implementing the Barbados Programme of Action ; it must make more effective use of existing resources and improve the coordinating machinery for focused , agreed implementation activities in priority areas for the achievement of the sustainable development of small island developing States .  
Island States must elaborate suitable national and regional sustainable development strategies and create domestic political , economic , social , environmental and legal conditions that promote the implementation of these strategies .  
In this regard , it is imperative that the developed countries ensure the transfer of technology and technical assistance and reverse the downward trend of official development assistance if they really want to help the developing world to attain sustainable development .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
Developing countries priorities are to eradicate poverty , with international support for achieving poverty reduction targets as agreed in United Nations conferences and summits , and improve standards of living , including meeting basic needs and lessening the burden of external debt , while taking all possible steps to avoid environmental damage and social inequity , for the furtherance of sustainable development .  
Engage industries and economic sectors , in both public and private sectors , and all other major groups at the national and international levels , as appropriate , in activities relating to sustainable consumption and production with the objective of developing optimal strategies and or programmes , including targets and timetables , at the appropriate levels for more sustainable consumption and production , including cleaner production and affordable eco-efficiency .  
Increase efforts to address the critical issues of fresh water and sanitation in human settlements in developing countries through , inter alia , the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the provision of financial resources for implementation , as elaborated in Agenda 21 , as a priority of the international agenda on sustainable consumption and production ;  
Some delegations stated that cleaner production and eco-efficiency , based on improved skills , technologies and efficient use of energy and resources , were essential to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries .  
To develop environmentally , socially and culturally compatible forms of tourism and to continue the development and implementation of voluntary initiatives in support of sustainable tourism development , bearing in mind that such forms of tourism and initiatives should meet , or preferably exceed , relevant local , national , regional or international standards ;  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
To undertake a comprehensive survey and assessment of the results of implementing existing voluntary initiatives and guidelines relating to the economic , sociocultural and environmental sustainability of tourism , to be reported to the Commission on Sustainable Development in order to identify best practices with respect to raising awareness of sustainable tourism development ;  
It was emphasized that a global framework and plan of action for sustainable tourism must be coupled with implementation and decision-making at the local level , as well as at the regional and national levels .  
Promoting broad-based sustainable development through tourism while safeguarding the integrity of local cultures and protecting the environment requires an effective partnership between key stakeholders at the local , national , regional and international levels and participation at all levels of tourism planning , development and assessment .  
On fisheries and other marine living resources , participants stressed the crucial importance in much of the world of ensuring continuing sustainable supply of food from the oceans and seas ( a matter of particular moment for many communities in developing countries ) as well as the need to protect marine biological diversity .  
In its discussions , the Committee considered the pending issues pertaining to a sustainable energy future , and identified the seven most critical issues that require urgent attention during the preparatory process , particularly by the Open-ended Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Energy and Sustainable Development and by the Commission .  
The Commission may wish to express its recognition of outstanding development issues and constraints related to sustainable energy development , which should facilitate sustainable energy policies to be formulated and implemented , especially at the national level within a regional context .  
Innovative and new approaches for financing development of sustainable energy , including renewable sources of energy is required and essential while continuing to pursue efforts to increase official development assistance , ensure continued replenishment of the Global Environmental Facility and encourage domestic and foreign private investments .  
For many developing countries , human , technical and financial resources are still not adequate , imposing severe restraints on their domestic capacity to meet the requirements of developing and using sustainable energy systems .  
In addition , the design and development are lacking of a common strategy for energy-related activities in the system aimed at promoting a balanced and mutually reinforcing approach to the economic , social and environmental aspects of sustainable energy development and of fostering partnership for sustainable energy development with relevant actors outside the United Nations system .  
Mr . Nebenzia ( Russian Federation ) said that his country attached great importance to international cooperation for the sustainable development of human settlements and the improvement of the social and economic conditions of urban and rural populations.In that context , the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements played a vital role as guarantor of the implementation of the decisions taken at the Habitat II Conference .  
Similarly , at the national level , there was a growing awareness that sustainable development , as well as the prevention and peaceful settlement of most contemporary conflicts , depended on effective guarantees of human rights .  
In the light of the immense potential of space remote sensing in providing vital input for soil conservation , water resources , management , forest monitoring , land management , coastal and river basin protection , agriculture and drought management , and flood mapping and sustainable integrated development , action must be initiated to promote intensive cooperation among various countries within the region to enable them to benefit from each others expertise .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
FAO has developed frameworks and guidelines for the implementation of the approach , including documents entitled Our land our future : a new approach to land use planning and management ( 1996 ) ; Negotiating a sustainable future for the land , structural and institutional guidelines on natural resource management in the twenty-first century ( 1997 ) ; and The future of our land : facing the challenge , guidelines for integrated planning for sustainable management of land resources ( 1998 ) .  
The farming systems approach to development is considered to be potentially useful in improving planning and analytical capacity in identifying , developing and implementing ways to improve the productivity and therefore welfare of those involved in agriculture in a manner that is equitable and sustainable .  
A subsequent project identified the major causes for erosion and the high sedimentation of the Rewa River , and elaborated a detailed programme combining legal aspects , flood control , river regulation and appropriate land management practices for sustainable development of agricultural lands .  
Under the Commissions work programme on indicators for sustainable development and work programme on changing consumption and production patterns , a preliminary core set of indicators have been developed for consumption and production patterns , based on an expert group meeting held at the United Nations in March 1998 .  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasizing also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
The major challenge facing the international community is to assist Governments , especially those of developing countries , to promote tourism development within the framework of sustainable development in order to maximize the potential economic and social benefits from tourism without damaging the environment or cultural assets .  
The international community also has an important role in assisting developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , economies in transition and small island developing States , through the provision of financial and technical assistance to governments at all levels , to develop a range of meaningful and effective planning guidelines , codes of good practice , regulatory frameworks and policy provisions aimed at achieving sustainable tourism .  
The experience is that these soft forms of tourism can be just as destructive as mass tourism , if they are not planned , developed and managed in a sustainable manner , so as to ensure that there are no adverse effects on the natural environment or the local sociocultural fabric , and that the local community is involved in all development and management phases .  
The main adverse impacts of tourism on the environment are connected to pressure on natural resources , harm to wildlife and habitats ( with associated loss of biological diversity ) , the generation of pollution and wastes , and social and cultural pressures related to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
A number of initiatives have been taken by Governments , in all parts of the world to : ( a ) develop national strategies or master plans for sustainable development of tourism ; ( b ) develop appropriate regulatory mechanisms and tools , such as environmental assessment and the development of building regulations and environmental standards for tourism ; ( c ) create terrestrial and marine protected areas ; and ( d ) support voluntary initiatives by the tourism industry .  
WTO has also been active , focusing in particular on planning at the national and local levels and on indicators for sustainable tourism , and addressing sustainable tourism in a number of regional forums . 4 A number of other international organizations have developed activities for sustainable tourism ; in particular , UNESCO has addressed , inter alia , tourism in World Heritage Sites and cultural tourism . 
Examining the challenge of averting internal population displacements , the workshop recognized that prevention is a multifaceted undertaking , involving a range of related tasks : eliminating poverty and promoting sustainable development ; ensuring respect for human and minority rights ; establishing equitable and democratic forms of government ; encouraging the peaceful resolution of disputes ; ending social injustice and averting the growth of ethnic or communal antagonisms .  
Emphasizing the necessity for the developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for a domestic industrial transformation of their commodity production with a view to enhancing productivity and stabilizing and increasing their export earnings , thus promoting the sustainable economic growth of developing countries in their integration into the global economy ,  
The Bah International Community , with over five-million members from all strata of society organized as approximately 17 , 000 local communities and 175 national and regional communities , is committed to peace and engaged in a wide range of activities.These activities include but are not limited to fostering grass-roots participation in sustainable development initiatives , advancing the status of women , eliminating racism , and promoting and protecting human rights . 
At the regional level , ongoing activities conducive to the sustainable management of coastal and marine resources include training of personnel , acquisition of equipment and facilities , production of stock assessment data and other resource inventories , upgrading of skills for management of marine parks , studies on pollution , information exchange and sharing of experience from within and outside the regions , and production of ICAM plans using regional guidelines .  
Small island developing States also have been the recipients of formal and informal training efforts to improve their capacity to implement sustainable coastal and marine resource management from regional and international institutions .  
ICAM is often seen as an environmental rather than a sustainable development programme ; thus , it has often received limited funding from national budgets ; further , many small island developing States do not have the environmental tools ( for example , indicators for integrating environmental considerations with economic development ) for decision-making , which would allow Governments to estimate the true cost of environmental degradation ;  
Development of a policy and adoption of effective methods for the sustainable development of EEZs ; the small land area of small island developing States has resulted in efforts to extend their activities towards the sea ( for example , reclamation of land , marine-based tourism , exploitation of minerals and oil ) ; these plans will have significant impacts on the fragile and vulnerable marine ecosystems of these States if not implemented with the utmost precaution , based on a systematic approach .  
Enhancing the capability of small island developing States to ( i ) assess and monitor fish catch and the processing and marketing of fish by foreign and domestic fishing companies ; ( ii ) develop a legal framework for sustainable fisheries activities ; and ( iii ) develop management plans and policies for assessing , monitoring and exploiting both the living and non-living resources in the EEZ ;  
Completion and implementation as called for under article 6 of the Convention on Biodiversity , of comprehensive national biodiversity strategy and action plans that , by individual country , ( i ) assess the state of knowledge on biodiversity ; ( ii ) identify vulnerable and endangered ecosystems and species ; ( iii ) identify activities and processes that endanger biodiversity ; and ( iv ) contain strategies for the protection and sustainable use of island biodiversity .  
Most small island developing States would derive tremendous benefits from the introduction of environmentally sustainable technological innovations in the areas of the development of renewable energy , freshwater and marine resources ; telecommunications and information technology ; waste management and natural disaster mitigation ; and sustainable land resources management .  
Given the serious lack of resources and qualified personnel in small island developing States , a realistic short-to-medium term strategy for building scientific and technological capacity to manage the effective transition to sustainable development would be to concentrate on subregional measures , wherever feasible .  
Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote the role and capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries within the framework of a dialogue between the private and the public sector .  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
The foregoing national measures need to be supplemented by measures at the regional level , including ( a ) the implementation of a sustainable marketing strategy at the regional level , and ( b ) the adoption of uniform incentives at the regional level to reduce competition among small island developing States to attract foreign capital .  
The contribution of those living in extreme poverty could be of decisive importance in current thinking on sustainable human development and the right to development , especially since the concept of development is no longer viewed only from an economic standpoint , but also in social and cultural terms .  
I should therefore like to assure you once again that I am determined to proceed with the effective implementation of a whole range of political , structural , economic and military reforms that are required in order to consolidate peace and promote sustainable development .  
The present section summarizes , by region and by sea , the main priorities and challenges , developments in decision-making , and activities at the national level to promote integrated coastal zone management , marine environment protection , and sustainable use and conservation of marine living resources .  
The major challenges of the region are to secure a healthy sea environment at a time when economic recovery is being pursued ; completion of effective regulatory and institutional frameworks , particularly for integrated coastal zone management and sustainable fisheries ; and enhancement of public awareness and cooperation between stakeholders .  
During the period under review , a number of small island developing States in all regions have been affected by adverse economic developments which have impaired their financial capacity to implement even priority sustainable development measures.This is particularly true for the Pacific small island developing States , where a combination of internal and external factors have impinged adversely on their economic performance .  
This will require that the Programme of Action be firmly placed on the political agenda at the national , regional and international levels and be fully recognized by Governments and civil society in all small island developing States and the international community as the framework for sustainable development activities in small island developing States .  
Stressing that any credible strategy for the reduction of the natural disaster effects of future El Nio occurrences must be based on effective dialogue and cooperation between the scientific and technological areas of the United Nations system and its operational responsibilities in the fields of disaster management , humanitarian assistance , sustainable development , technical cooperation and capacity-building , including data-collection , monitoring and early warning systems , at all levels ,  
The main users will be authorities and government officials concerned with environmental management and sustainable development , the programming , coordination and management of the use of natural resources and energy , human settlements , in particular ministries of housing and urban planning and local governments , and international and regional transport .  
Annual regional courses in connection with management of multiple uses of water , rights to water use and regulation of water-related public utility companies ; and the management of sustainable development at the local level ; ( iii ) Projects .  
To help strengthen the capacities of developing countries in sustainable human development through TCDC , the Unit supported a number of strategic initiatives aimed at increasing the sharing of experiences in critical areas and strengthening networking among centres of excellence .  
During its first session , the Commission on Enterprise , Business Facilitation and Development recognized the crucial role played by small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) in stimulating broad-based , equitable and sustainable development , as well as the role of the changing global economic environment and the pressures this puts on SMEs .  
In the light of the above , the Commission , at its third session ( 23-27 November 1998 ) , agreed to convene an expert meeting on the Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote SME development in developing countries .  
There are also few successful examples of DFIs that have proven able to operate profitably with SMEs - among these , the Corporaci \ n Andina de Fomento ( CAF ) , a private multilateral financial institution which promotes sustainable development and regional integration by attracting capital resources for the provision of multiple financial services to the public and private sectors of the shareholding countries . 
I have the honour to refer to Economic and Social Council resolution 1999-4 of 7 May 1999 in which the Council decided to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti with the mandate of submitting to the Council at its substantive session of 1999 recommendations on how to ensure that international community assistance to the efforts to support the Government of Haiti in achieving sustainable development was adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
As you are aware , the Economic and Social Council , by its resolution 1999-4 of 7 May 1999 , decided to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti with the mandate of submitting to the Council , at its substantive session of 1999 , recommendations on how to ensure that international community assistance to the efforts to support the Government of Haiti in achieving sustainable development was adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
A consensus was emerging on the fundamentals of sustainable human development , as illustrated by the fact that the Bretton Woods institutions had adopted an approach to development inspired by the United Nations , while the United Nations had moved far in supporting responsible macroeconomic policies on the part of Member States .  
While SADC welcomed debt-relief initiatives , including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) debt initiative , it believed that the international community should start writing off the external debt of those countries that had made visible and sustainable progress in the implementation of tough structural adjustment measures and political reforms , so that they could invest the resources thus freed up in social sectors .  
Intensify efforts to implement legislative and administrative measures as well as to promote public education , with special attention to youth , about the need for sustainable production and consumption patterns ; foster sustainable natural resource use ; and work concertedly to prevent environmental degradation within their countries ;  
Affirming that developed countries have a major responsibility in the context of growing interdependence to create and sustain a global economic environment that is favourable to accelerated and sustainable development ,  
As part of this strategy of transformation which entails moving from reconstruction to sustainable development , we shall continue our efforts to integrate the region effectively into the global economy by implementing an agenda for competitiveness and sustainable development , based on upgrading our human resources , on making our institutions more effective and our infrastructure more appropriate and on scientific and technological progress . 
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Finally , the active involvement of the Bretton Woods institutions both in the final event and in the preparatory process was crucial : only through the coordinated efforts of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions would the common objective of poverty reduction and sustainable development be achieved .  
If it was to achieve its enormous potential , that process must be accompanied by a new , just , equitable and sustainable world order , which included the active participation of the so-called third world countries in the global decision-making processes , a profound transformation of the international monetary system , a comprehensive approach to development , and a bridging of the increasing gap between the richer countries and the vast majority of poorer countries .  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ,  
Urges also the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , provision of basic social services , poverty eradication , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of youth , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , political freedom , popular participation , respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
The Conference agreed that an acceptable definition of the concept of sustainable development in agriculture was one in which the development satisfied the following conditions : ( a ) that it lead to the production of sufficient food ; ( b ) that it did not harm the environment ; ( c ) that it was acceptable to society ; ( d ) that it was an economically viable approach ; and ( e ) that it met the needs of the present without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet theirs .  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financing environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasizing also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasizing also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
The current meeting would be another milestone in the quest for sustainable development , which represented a basic precondition for peace and collective human security for global economic order .  
Goals and targets agreed upon by the international community in relation to sustainable development , such as the adoption of national sustainable development strategies and increased support to developing countries , must be implemented in a timely fashion .  
The North must be gracious and generous , and give enough of what has been acquired from global resources to assist poor and weak countries to help propel them into the orbit of sustainable and irreversible social and economic growth .  
Each session of the General Assembly provides us with a unique opportunity to develop a unified approach and to coordinate our actions at the global level for the sake of a truly democratic , secure and sustainable development of humanity .  
We are of the view that illegal , unregulated , unreported fishing activities have a severe adverse impact on the effectiveness of measures for the sustainable management and exploitation of marine living resources .  
The quest for a unilateral security advantage for a few or the assertion of the right to an exclusive standard of national security is contrary to the spirit of a durable and sustainable system of international security in todays world .  
It also recognized that economic growth in general , supported in the context of sustainable development , is essential to ongoing social development and that welldesigned social policies have a beneficial effect on economic and social development .  
Among the main laws are the law on educational reform within the framework of sustainable human development which covers social , economic , political and cultural aspects intended to promote peoples growth as individuals and members of society .  
The annual assistance flow of around 200-million dollars has alleviated human suffering in the short run and prevented major humanitarian disasters but has not provided the foundation for sustainable development .  
Promoting community development , improving access to security of land tenure , housing and basic services , and fully integrating people living in poverty into economic , social and political life , which are crucial to sustainable development ;  
Equity demanded that the transfer of capital and technology to the emerging economies should be driven not only by the need for cheap and abundant labour , but by a desire to create viable and sustainable production and fair access to international markets .  
It had identified strengthened industrial capacity and clean and sustainable industrial development as the two main priority areas of its technical assistance to the developing countries .  
In Israel , public participation is considered crucial to the sound development of sustainable agriculture through linkages between government ministries , local authorities , the private sector , academic institutions and scientists .  
Several comprehensive programmes on sustainable farming systems are being promoted by national authorities in developed and developing countries , by regional and international institutions and NGOs .  
The dialogue segments launched in 1998 have since been recognized as a unique participatory model for effectively engaging major groups and Governments in a genuine dialogue on specific sustainable development issues .  
However , while economic growth has remained positive on average , the rate of growth has not been sustainable because it was based on external factors such as good weather and favourable commodity prices .  
Capacity 21 was another UNDP innovative initiative , which dated from 1993 and was aimed at facilitating the integration of economic , social and environmental considerations into national programmes for sustainable development .  
However , his Government was confident that with the support of civil society and the assistance of the United Nations specialized agencies , its efforts would lead to sustainable human development and improve the basic standard of living of its population .  
Urged countries to engage in raising awareness of the ecological , social , cultural and economic roles that planted and natural forests might fulfil in the rehabilitation and sustainable management of forests in environmentally critical areas ;  
A peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication as well as sustainable and equitable development ;  
The major objective of SARD is to enhance food security ( defined as access to the food required for a healthy and productive life ) in an environmentally sound way so as to contribute to sustainable natural resource management .  
The widespread dissemination of technological information and innovative institutional practices to all stakeholders is required to enhance the ability of developing countries to introduce sustainable agricultural practices .  
A participatory democratic political system with transparency and accountability supported by rule of law and efficient administrative institutions , is required both for sustainable development and for dealing positively with globalization forces .  
Thus , it should be stressed that sustainable participatory development would not , then , be fully achieved , as it remains conditional on political , economic and social , environmental and cultural sustainability .  
At present , it is obvious that the world needs sustainable economic and social development based on strategic approaches to balanced and rational use of natural and water resources .  
To promote regional cooperation for the development and practical application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of the sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ;  
Some have forged ahead and developed integrated , multisectoral approaches to sustainable development which necessitated the establishment of national focal points or coordinating bodies for the implementation of the outcomes of global conferences / summits .  
The major issue addressed had been the peaceful use of nuclear energy , including maritime transport of such energy , radioactive materials , nuclear safety and technical cooperation and the liability and role of nuclear energy in sustainable development .  
Raising the priority of adequate shelter and sustainable urban development in international cooperation in light of their profound links with all aspects of social development , economic growth and environmental protection ;  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
Noting that the consistent use of accurate place names is an essential element of effective communication worldwide , and supports socioeconomic development , sustainable development and national infrastructure ,  
Policy and institutional reforms to create a sound socioeconomic and political environment to transform the social and productive basis for development into one in which sustainable , equitable and genderbalanced development can take place .  
The State institutions responsible for labour issues should be modified to ensure a planned approach throughout the country which includes educational , preventive and promotional elements , and has a budgetary allocation sufficient to make it sustainable .  
He stressed that early entry into force of the 1995 Fish Stocks Agreement would be a major boost towards the goal of sustainable and responsible fisheries , and he emphasized that cooperation and coordination were essential also at the national level .  
To develop a legally binding framework for regulating the actions of transnational corporations ( TNCs ) , respecting the international labour , human rights , and sustainable environmental standards set by the United Nations and its relevant specialized agencies .  
Good governance , namely transparent and democratic management of public affairs by accountable national institutions , was as important as an international environment favourable to sustainable development .  
Because Kosovos health indicators are the worst in Europe , WHO is leading the process of reform from the existing centralized and specialistoriented system towards a comprehensive , horizontal and sustainable primary care approach .  
The three Es competitive economy , sound environment and productive employmentare not isolated targets , but interrelated parts that require a combined approach to achieve sustainable industrial development .  
The biggest deterrent to violent conflict is the promotion of sustainable human development and a healthy democratic society based on strong rule of law and civic institutions , including adherence to all human rights economic , social , political and cultural .  
The biggest deterrent to violent conflict is the promotion of sustainable human development and a healthy democratic society based on strong rule of law and civic institutions , including adherence to all human rights economic , social , political and cultural .  
Finally , he said that Governments , organizations and the entire international community must work together to create favourable internal and external conditions for gradual economic growth and successful , socially oriented sustainable growth for all States .  
It was essential that the Conference should be based on a global approach to development , that reflected not only basic economic aspects but also the social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
The focus should be placed on the social , economic and environmental pillars of sustainable development , as expressed in broad themes recognized as the main challenges before the international community .  
Rich in biodiversity , the countries of the Rio Group had made huge efforts at the national , regional and subregional level to protect their environment and to balance economic , social and environmental factors in promoting genuine sustainable development .  
Flows of private capital to certain developing countries must not be counted as contributions towards sustainable development , as the main driving force behind them was the profit motive , and not the wellbeing of future generations .  
Innovative research , such as that which contributed such key concepts to current development thinking as sustainable human development ( SHD ) and global public goods will be strengthened ;  
That was why the European Union supported the debt cancellation measures for heavily indebted poor countries decided on under the enhanced HIPC initiative , which aimed to cut their debts to a sustainable level .  
Was aware that sustainable energy policy interventions can make important contributions to economic welfare , to social welfare , and to protecting the local , regional and global environment ;  
Endorse the core set of indicators thus developed as a valuable starting point for countries that may wish to organize and elaborate their own national programmes for the testing , development and use of national level indicators of sustainable development ;  
Basic human services must not be destroyed ; subsidies and transfers necessary to guarantee humane minimum standards for the poor must be maintained ; and funds needed for sustainable economic recovery must be set aside .  
There is a pressing need for a substantial increase in the level of funding and its effective use to coordinate coherent and sustainable approaches to statistical capacitybuilding .  
For countries mainly indebted to private foreign creditors , a primary goal of solutions to debt-servicing crises is sustainable borrowing from international financial markets under normal terms of access .  
The focus of this dialogue will be aligned with the issues that are on the agenda of this meeting , that is , need for a global partnership to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , reconfirming the need for an integrated and strategically focused approach to the implementation of Agenda 21 and addressing the main challenges and opportunities faced by the international community in this regard .  
Underlining the importance of the World Summit on Sustainable Development 24 / to be held in 2002 to review the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , to reinvigorate the global commitment to sustainable development and , as a critical opportunity to advance international cooperation for sustainable development on the basis of concrete commitments at the highest level ,  
Decides that the next session of the Governing Council / Global Ministerial Environment Forum should undertake in depth discussion of the report with a view to providing its input on future requirements of international environmental governance in the broader context of multilateral efforts for sustainable development to the tenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory body for the World Summit on Sustainable Development at its meeting at the Ministerial level in May 2002 as a contribution to the World Summit on Sustainable Development ;  
In conclusion , we hope that todays very broad discussion with the family of United Nations organs and agencies , relevant institutions and Member States will be a step forward to the successful implementation of a fully integrated and broad-based subregional approach aimed at addressing the multifaceted problems confronting the region and promoting durable peace and sustainable development in West Africa .  
We wish to design the strategic guidelines for the development of East Timor as the most effective means to correctly allocate both human and material resources and to obtain genuine sustainable development for the newly emerging independent nation .  
It is imperative that the international community continue to provide technical and financial assistance and to assist the people of East Timor in creating an enabling environment for sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
A genuine and sustainable peace can be achieved only when proper living conditions are insured for all our inhabitants and when there is a sufficient level of economic development for everyone to meet his basic needs , when fundamental human rights are respected and when social and political differences are resolved through democratic channels .  
I would note , however , that although there is clearly an urgent need for demonstrable progress in this area and we know that this issue of return is of key symbolic and political importance it remains UNMIKs and our firm policy that return should take place in secure and sustainable conditions .  
To do this , we need to address four major objectives : first , consolidate the secure and stable environment that presently exists ; secondly , steer East Timor through the creation of democratic institutions and successful , peaceful elections ; thirdly , put in place the building blocks for the management of public finances and policy-making ; and fourthly , establish the framework for a sustainable and effective Government administration .  
The continued commitment and patience of the East Timorese and the confirmed strong support of the international community will be essential during this complex period and beyond independence if East Timor is to have a sustainable and democratic future .  
In the declaration it adopted at the Summit meeting in September of last year , the Council reaffirmed its determination to give equal priority to the maintenance of international peace and security in every region of the world , while paying special attention to the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , in view of the special needs of the continent and the specific characteristics of the conflicts raging on its territories .  
The overall goal is to find what Mr . Brahimi called a home-grown solution one which is credible , legitimate and sustainable and leads to a broad-based Government which is responsible , representative , stable and accountable ; enjoys both internal and external stability ; respects the human rights of the Afghan people ; and will never again allow the country to be used as a breeding ground for terror or drug trafficking .  
The year 2004 could be seen as a target year by which time concrete progress should have been made in the identification and elaboration of issues of direct concern to families and in the provision of practical guidelines for national , regional and global actions as part of a sustained long-term effort to strengthen the economic and sustainable livelihood of families .  
In my report to the Security Council , I underscored the need for a viable and sustainable financial mechanism and noted that a financial mechanism based on voluntary contributions will not provide the assured and continuous source of funding required for the operation of the Special Court ( S / 2000 / 915 , para .  70 ) .  
Governments , relevant United Nations agencies , Bretton Woods institutions and civil society organizations ( including unions , the private sector , mass media and universities ) should all be actively involved in identifying the most effective ways to achieve sustainable social outcomes for children .  
Its innovative programmes in the field of sustainable development , for example the BIOTRADE initiative and the greenhouse gas emission trading rights programme , could sow the seeds of a future development model featuring economic growth compatible with life , human values and nature .  
UNFPA is also working collaboratively with key United Nations agencies and other relevant partners in the follow-up to UNCED through the Task Manager system , including global initiatives in the areas of basic social services , ageing , gender , youth , health , human rights , education , HIV / AIDS , food security and sustainable development to highlight the linkages between population and reproductive health , a higher quality of life , poverty reduction and the provision of an enabling environment .  
The main challenge lies both for developed and developing countries in the development , utilization and dissemination of renewable energy technologies , such as solar , wind , ocean , wave , geothermal , biomass and hydro power , on a scale wide enough to significantly contribute to energy for sustainable development .  
In order to promote energy for sustainable development there is a need for favourable access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in particular to developing countries , through supportive measures that promote technology cooperation and that enable transfer of necessary technological know-how as well as building up of economic , technical and managerial capabilities for the efficient use and further development of transferred technology .  
The Working Group underlined the importance to realizing the right to development of strengthening good governance at the national level including through building effective and accountable institutions for promoting growth and sustainable human development , while recognizing of course that responsibility for determining and implementing good governance practices rests with the State concerned .  
The first was the need to preserve outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes and to promote international cooperation for such purposes , the objective being to achieve continued economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular the developing countries .  
In that sense , Peru endorsed the United Nations Programme on Space Applications but believed that the measures covered by the Programme could be carried out only through effective international cooperation based on access to technology , the elaboration of specific projects for space activities and the transmission of processed information that would have a practical and direct effect on the sustainable development of States . 
The work of the Conference was organized around three technical committees , established to deal with a range of specific issues pertinent to cartography , surveying , land management , GIS technology and spatial data infrastructure in support of sustainable development , as defined by an agenda item of the Conference .  
The focus of this dialogue will be aligned with the issues that are on the agenda of the fourth preparatory committee meeting that is , need for a global partnership to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , reconfirming the need for an integrated and strategically focused approach to the implementation of Agenda 21 , and addressing the main challenges and opportunities faced by the international community in this regard .  
The importance that regional workshops undertaken within the Framework be accompanied by concrete and sustainable subregional and national activities , as well as by training and awareness programmes for government officials and key professional groups such as the police , prison officials , educators , judges , lawyers , and parliamentarians , was also recognized .  
For developing countries , official development assistance ( ODA ) is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
The Commission could emphasize that the Earths atmosphere must be considered , with the oceans and the land surface , as one of the three basic interacting domains that comprise the global life-support system , and that sustainable development is inextricably linked with the impact that variations in the atmosphere itself can have on human activity , ecosystems and natural disasters . 
It was generally agreed that it is important for countries to establish an enabling environment at both the international and domestic levels in order to promote sustainable development , including economic growth , social development and environmental protection .  
Monitoring the implementation of sustainable development goals through the assessment of data collected at the national , regional and international levels is one of the main objectives of the Division for Sustainable Development . 16 As decided by the Commission on Sustainable Development in 1993 , the Division invites Governments and organizations to submit the relevant information to the Commission . 
In 1997 , the General Assembly recommended that the Commissions approved programme of work on sustainable development indicators result in a practicable and agreed set of indicators , suited to country-specific conditions , including a limited number of aggregated indicators .  
Representatives of national councils on sustainable development who met at a forum , organized in conjunction with the eighth session of the Commission would have welcomed a longer lead time and more thorough regional consultations in advance of the meeting to consolidate better their respective positions on the issues considered at the Commission .  
The further implementation of Agenda 21 is still impaired by insufficient clarity at the conceptual level and insufficient integration of the social , economic and environmental aspects of sustainable development .  
Reaffirming that alternative development as a process to prevent and eliminate the illicit cultivation of plants containing narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances by adopting rural development measures that are specifically designed for that purpose and that are carried out in the context of sustained national economic growth and sustainable development efforts in countries taking action against drugs , recognizing the particular socio-cultural characteristics of the target communities and groups , within the framework of a comprehensive and permanent solution to the problem of illicit drugs ,  
Within that global objective , the Commission would concentrate on six areas of comparative advantage : trade and development ; regional integration and cooperation ; macro-economic policies linked with poverty reduction strategies , in particular the strengthening of social sectors such as health and education ; reliable and sustainable transport ; food security and sustainable rural development strategies ; and institutional capacity-building , good governance and the rule of law .  
The leaders attach special importance to the subject of Arab economic integration and are establishing measures to promote this aspect of joint Arab action so as to achieve a link between shared interests and mutual benefits , as well as strengthen the economic capabilities of their States by adopting an Arab plan that will enable the achievement of full sustainable development and increase joint economic action through positive interaction with the realities of the global economy and the phenomenon of globalization .  
The objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the LDCs and ultimately to put LDCs on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .  
Through its constructive partnerships with Government authorities and civil society at the local and national levels , the Human Rights Division of UNOA is actively helping to create sustainable mechanisms and processes that contribute to enabling institutions to protect human rights and for Angolans to know and exercise them .  These partnerships involve various activities and projects that are almost exclusively funded through voluntary contributions .  
Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources , in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation , and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms , as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms , combating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
The role of developing countries in establishing or enhancing favourable conditions for a sustainable enabling environment for both domestic and international investments , including improving the legal , economic and social environment for investment .  
This will require the operationalization by all relevant actors of common policy goals set out in the international development targets and the Millennium Declaration agreed to by all United Nations Member States , and , when possible , common country approaches and strategies based on developing countries national priorities and development plans , including strategies for sustainable development .  
The high-level international conference should issue a political declaration expressing a firm political will and an undertaking on the part of all governments and of the entire international community to take collective action in addressing the issue of financing to ensure sustainable development for all .  The conference should define the political principles to be applied at both the national and the international level , as well as the collective objectives and goals to be attained and the means needed to accomplish this .  
The provision of increased financial resources , inter alia , through innovative approaches , as well as technical assistance and transfer of environmentally sound technology at the international and national levels , was highlighted in the final report of IFF . 8 It was also stated that such support is particularly needed for capacity-building , and for creating participatory and innovative mechanisms for financing sustainable forest management . 
Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources , in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation , and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms , as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms , combating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Special emphasis on LDCs and assistance in the progressive integration in the global economy by upgrading competitiveness , enhancing productive capacity , stimulating innovations and increasing the level of incomes through a process of industrialization that is compatible with sustainable development ;  
Aware also that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that the eradication of poverty in developing countries depends on the implementation of policies directed towards conservation and the sustainable use of biological resources ,  
Political environment : It was broadly acknowledged that conflict prevention and resolution and good governance ( including a reliable , effective , and transparent legal and administrative system ) are indispensable elements for sustainable and people-centered development .  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
The key tasks were : to ensure security during the transitional period and arrangements for East Timors post-independence security ; to establish a credible system of justice in which fundamental human rights are respected ; to achieve a reasonable level of reconstruction of public services and infrastructure ; to establish an administration that is financially sustainable ; and to manage a political transition to independence , culminating in the adoption of a constitution and democratic elections ( see S / 2000 / 738 , para .  68 ) .  
UNTAET essentially faced many challenges with regard to public administration , among which was , first , the rapid establishment of a functioning administrative apparatus within a context of decimated human and material infrastructure , and second , moving East Timorese into positions of responsibility as soon and as much as possible to create a sustainable East Timorese administration ( Timorization ) .  
To do this , we must : ( i ) maintain the integrity of ecosystems and the continued health of the planets life-support system which sustain the productivity , adaptability of renewal of all life ; ( ii ) maintain biological diversity in the variety of life on which ecological processes depend processes that provide a stream of current and future benefits to human beings ; and ( iii ) ensure sustainable population dynamics ( size of population , growth rate and distribution ) , as it often exerts pressures on the environment .  
First , where countries have established or are well on the way to establishing an enabling environment for sustainable development and poverty reduction , including effective public management systems , they can absorb a full range of enhanced assistance , including budget support and predictable long-term commitments , aimed at achieving major development goals .  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , represents a viable strategy for developing countries to pursue individually and collectively sustained economic growth and sustainable development and to ensure their participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Urges , in the context of the expansion of the technical and economic cooperation among developing countries modalities , donor countries , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions as well as other development partners to intensify their efforts to support South-South initiatives designed to benefit especially the least developed countries , landlocked developing countries , transit developing countries and small island developing States with a view to expanding their intra-trade and intra-investment opportunities and achieving sustainable development and more equitable integration into the global economy ;  
As development thinking shifts towards sustainable human development and parallel good governance and economic development , South-South initiatives are required to move easily from technical collaboration to joint efforts in social and economic development .  
In conclusion , anti-poverty policies are more likely to be effective , sustainable , inclusive , equitable and meaningful to those living in poverty if they are based upon international human rights .  
The achievement of such consensus and hence the fulfilment of important commitments , including those aimed at bringing about the necessary structural changes for sustainable social and productive development , public participation , strengthening of the political system and modernization of the democratic State could provide the opportunity to reactivate the peace process and make sure that it is irreversible .  
With a view to achieving sustainable development of production , the agreements established the need for legal , institutional and financial reforms in order to consolidate a democratic , inclusive , decentralized and participatory State .  
In the present report , I have stressed that conflict prevention lies at the heart of the mandate of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security , and that a general consensus has emerged among Member States that comprehensive and coherent conflict prevention strategies offer the greatest potential for promoting lasting peace and creating an enabling environment for sustainable development .  
The objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the LDCs and ultimately to put LDCs on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .  
We request the international community to strongly support poverty eradication , and welcome the ongoing consultations by the Secretary-General on the establishment of a world solidarity fund for poverty eradication to finance and realize , inter alia , the social policies and programmes of the Habitat Agenda to address challenges of poverty eradication and sustainable development in developing countries , especially the least developed countries , bearing in mind the voluntary nature of the contributions .  
The General Assembly may also wish to take note of the decision adopted by the Council of the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) at its last meeting recognizing fully that the issue of land degradation is integral to the pursuit of sustainable development and poverty alleviation and synergies among the global environmental conventions and deciding to designate land degradation ( desertification and deforestation ) as a GEF focal area as a means for enhancing GEF support for the successful implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification .  
We further express our determination to maximize the benefits of globalization with a view to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , through strengthening cooperation to create increased opportunities for trade , economic growth and sustainable development , global communications through the use of new technologies and increased intercultural exchange through the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity , which may contribute to the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
The Group was convinced that the industrialization strategy developed through the integrated programmes constituted one of the best means of ensuring the sustainable industrial development of developing countries and of alleviating poverty and ensuring productive employment .  
Slovakia fully supported the continuation of UNIDOs successful transformation in order to increase the impact , relevance and usefulness of the Organization in its task of promoting responsible and sustainable industrial development , as a means of achieving economic well-being and social development while ensuring environmental sustainability .  
It sought a partnership between the industrialized and the developing countries and economies in transition in which there would be no losers , creating stable conditions for effective international cooperation to eradicate poverty worldwide and bring sustainable development for all .  
UNIDO should systematize successful experiences and models of sustainable industrial development , taking account of the specific conditions in each country , so that strategic alliances with other international or regional bodies could be established .  
Gravely concerned at the illicit manufacture , transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons and their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world , which have a wide range of humanitarian and socio-economic consequences and pose a serious threat to peace , reconciliation , safety , security , stability and sustainable development at the individual , local , national , regional and international levels , 2 bis .  
The Ministers noted with appreciation enhanced CEI cooperation in the fields of promoting sustainable social , economic and ecological development , infrastructure and private sector investment , SME development , transborder and interregional cooperation ( such as the enhanced Szeged Process ) , human resource development , cultural as well as scientific and technological cooperation ( such as the Italian-Slovenian transfrontier television project ) , including in the field of geodesy , combating organized crime , protection of minorities , womens entrepreneurship and youth affairs .  
In that regard , Finland has actively supported the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative with the aim to have the developing countries commit themselves to the exercise of sustainable economic policies , alleviation of poverty and respect for human rights in return for a reduced debt burden .  
It is vital to restore North-South dialogue with two fundamental objectives : promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development as the priorities of cooperation and correcting the imbalances in the operation of the international economic system , which places developing countries at a clear disadvantage in their relationship with developed countries .  
The Government of Mexico considers that the international agenda should envisage at least five goals : greater and more effective participation by developing countries in international economic decision-making ; a truly open multilateral trade system reflecting the development needs of all nations ; a new international financial architecture releasing resources for productive investment ; an effective prevention and response capacity to deal with international financial crises ; and sustainable and integrated worldwide economic growth .  
The strategies and guidelines for social policy set out in the National Development Plan include initiatives to reverse the causes of extreme poverty in the shortest possible time and will be sustainable in the long term ; their basic objective is to help to meet the immediate needs of the marginal population and at the same time to support it , within a context of empowerment , so as to expedite its incorporation in productive life , breaking the vicious and inter-generational circle of poverty .  
At the national level , his Group and China supported the following recommendations made by the experts : raising awareness of the role and value of traditional knowledge and its contribution to the development process ; promoting , where appropriate , the commercialization of traditional knowledge-based products and services , involving indigenous and local communities in that endeavour , consistent with the sustainable use of biological resources ; and exploring suitable instruments , including sui generis systems for the protection of traditional knowledge .  
The representative of Lesotho pointed out that in developing countries , local and farming communities had , over the years , developed knowledge systems for the sustainable use of biodiversity , including the selection and breeding of plant varieties for agricultural purposes .  
The Commission had placed emphasis on raising the value of traditional knowledge , on promoting sustainable use of genetic resources , and on ensuring equitable benefit sharing in the commercialization of traditional knowledge based products , and it had recommended that the international community explore minimum standards for an internationally recognized sui generis system . 
The previous report noted that the situation was worsening year by year , and described challenges in the area of sustainable human development resulting from the chronic instability of the countrys political , economic , social and security environment .  
The Plan of Action for the Decade provides for the establishment , upon the initiative of Governments or other relevant institutions , of national focal points or committees for human rights education , which should include a broad coalition of governmental and non-governmental actors and be responsible for developing and implementing a comprehensive , effective and sustainable national plan of action for human rights education .  
The Programme of Action states that the objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the least developed countries and ultimately to put least developed countries on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
As regards FDI and other private external flows , the Programme of Action recognizes that a stable economic , legal and institutional framework is crucial in order to attract foreign investment and to promote sustainable development through investment .  
The national programmes of action identified the difficulties and constraints faced by least developed countries and the required national and international support measures to eradicate poverty , overcome the structural bottlenecks in least developed countries and put these countries on the path of accelerated growth and sustainable development .  
They agreed that it was vital to address the problem in a comprehensive , integrated , sustainable and efficient manner , and recommended a series of practical actions to be taken by OAU member States at the national and regional levels .  
For the majority of the CEE region countries not so affected by direct desertification but faced by land degradation and so on , the major tasks are , inter alia , to establish and maintain the optimum proportions of arable land , meadows , pastures , forests and water areas in accordance with the principles of sustainable development and the capacity of the environment , to decrease over-cultivation of agricultural land through selective afforestation , bio-corridors or establishment of grasslands .  
The Refugee Education Trust , an independent fund established in December 2000 with strong support from United Nations agencies , donors , Governments and non-governmental organizations , is a mechanism designed to provide sustainable post-primary education , motivating refugee children to continue and complete primary schooling in the hope that they may return to their communities as teachers , professionals and leaders after obtaining the necessary skills at the post-primary level . 
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
The analytical studies confirmed that weak infrastructures and inefficient transit operations result in high transport costs and are major impediments to trade expansion and sustainable development in many landlocked and transit developing countries .  
The Money Matters Institutes mission is to foster dialogue among leaders of financial services , international institutions and policy makers in developing countries to encourage the most realistic role for private capital in financing sustainable development , and to generate the requisite supporting data about emerging economies so as to facilitate this purpose .  
The economic and social problems of the region remained acute and the rate of growth of gross domestic product ( GDP ) required to place Africa on the path of sustainable development had not been attained .  
The United States was committed to continuing and increasing support for sustainable economic growth and human development , accompanied by steady poverty reduction .  
We also draw the attention of the Committee to the initiative put forward to the President of the Russian Federation at the Millennium Summit with regard to ensuring energy supplies for the sustainable development of humankind , a radical solution to the problems posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to the problem of global environmental improvement .  
Reaffirms the commitments made by heads of State and Government at the World Summit for Social Development , contained in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development1 and the Programme of Action , 2 which established a new consensus to place people at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development and pledged to eradicate poverty , promote full and productive employment and foster social integration so as to achieve stable , safe and just societies for all ;  
On the domestic front , his Government had sought to improve the legal and economic instruments of environmental management and to promote a sustainable development by giving priority to investment in pollution prevention and various progressive environmental technologies ; and it would be working to improve the efficiency of the energy sector after accurately assessing the costs involved . 
The forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would be instrumental in reshaping the world economic order and making it more equitable , by inter alia , coming up with a sustainable solution to the debt crisis and reforming the international financial architecture .  
The World Summit on Sustainable Development would give the international community a unique opportunity to undertake a holistic and realistic assessment of the real challenges in the field of sustainable development and devise effective means to meet those challenges .  
This required revival of global economic growth , in a sustainable and more equitable manner , coupled with open markets and technical assistance for developing countries , and the removal of barriers to free exchange and investment within the developing world .  
The rapid expansion in global energy demand and the growing awareness of the need for sustainable development has put increasing focus on the environmental consequences of burning fossil fuels .  
It is gratifying to note that the Commission on Sustainable Development has recognized the value of nuclear energy in the context of sustainable development and has agreed that the choice to use appropriate energy sources should be left to the countries concerned .  
In my view , the benchmark for a sustainable democracy is the extent to which a State acts in accordance with universal and indivisible human rights : the civil and political rights , as well as the economic , social and cultural rights defined in international human rights law .  
On the subject of the environment and sustainable development , the Group of 77 and China were indeed pleased with the adoption at the first substantive session of the United Nations Forum on Forests of a multi-year programme of work and a plan of action .  They also wished to emphasize the necessity of providing the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification with adequate , predictable and stable financial resources .  
In that regard , the Union had identified the possible main themes for the Summit , which might serve as a preliminary basis for discussion in the future : protection of the natural resources that were the base of economic and social development ; integration of the environment and poverty eradication ; making globalization serve sustainable development ; and improving governance and participation .  
The goal of sustainable development for all required that a solution be found to the debt problem of the developing countries , the liberalization of the trade polices of the industrialized countries be encouraged , especially in sectors of interest to the countries of the South such as agriculture and textiles , the prices for raw materials stabilized , development assistance increased and the transfer of technology promoted , so as to reduce the growing gap between North and South which was the greatest threat to the developing countries .  
The endeavour to reverse the marginalization of developing countries , to promote their sustained economic growth and sustainable development and to facilitate their integration into the world economy had led the international community to search for integral and balanced global arrangements .  
They considered that the lack of access to modern and sustainable energy is a major cause of environmental and health hazards in vast areas of the developing world and a major impediment to quality of life , while recognizing both the fundamental role of energy as the largest component of gross domestic product in several countries and the very rapid changes taking place in that sector . 
Energy is central to achieving the interrelated economic , social and environmental aims of sustainable human development , and energy services play a crucial role in providing efficient access to energy in support of development .  
The issue of sustainable development should be addressed , since increased burning of firewood by the rural population , which lacks access to modern commercial energy , leads to environmental problems .

Believe that the strengthening of democratic institutions throughout the Latin American and Caribbean region , the advances made in peace processes in some countries of the region and greater public awareness have helped to incorporate the environmental dimension into the development process and to make people-centred sustainable development the first priority of the political , economic and social programmes of the States of Latin America and the Caribbean .  
Recognize the importance of the transparent and jointly responsible participation of civil society , including the main groups identified in Agenda 21 , in the design , implementation and follow-up of sustainable development policies and of regional and international commitments on these matters , and that it is essential to strengthen the cultural , educational and environmental training base that makes it possible to engage civil society in the achievement of sustainable development .  
Recognize that the viability of sustainable development in the region requires a stable , predictable , open and inclusive international economic system , in which the environmental dimension is acknowledged as an opportunity for investment and trade .  
Recognize also the special needs of regional and subregional ecosystems , including arid and semi-arid , mountain , forest , marine , aquatic and island ecosystems , which are rich and diverse but generally fragile as well , together with the importance of ensuring their conservation , protection and sustainable use .  
Recognize also that indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant to the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources constitute an important group for the sustainable production and consumption of goods and services , and that they should therefore participate in the design of policies and actions to achieve sustainable development ; that the use and enjoyment of natural resources in the places in which they live should be approached with respect ; and that their knowledge , innovations and practices should be legally protected and that continual feedback which benefits all concerned should thus be established . 
Recognize that gender equality has been fundamental in advancing efforts to achieve sustainable development and that the full participation of women in policy formulation and implementation should be strengthened at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
To promote the reinforcement of open public and private institutions and clearly defined standards that will help all individual and collective actors to forge their own development process and strengthen institutional links among economic , social and environmental policies with the participation of the population , as set forth in Agenda 21 , through national sustainable development councils .  
To promote more efficient ways of addressing the issue of sustainable development in multilateral forums through the use of flexible , suitable mechanisms for rationalizing efforts and the use of resources more fully and through the promotion of synergies among the relevant conventions , as set forth in Agenda 21 , by national sustainable development councils , among others , in order to articulate economic , social and environmental policies with the participation of the population .  
To recommend that the participants in the International Conference on the Financing of Development to be held in Monterrey , Mexico , in March 2002 , address the need to explore innovative and more effective mechanisms for financing the protection of national public goods that afford global benefits and that they propose means of linking the environmental dimension with countries fiscal policies in order to effectively incorporate financial sectors into the effort to achieve sustainable development goals .  
To underline the fact that given the existing complementarities among trade , investment , environmental quality , social well-being , growth , the benefits of the sustainable use of natural resources and the formation of an open and inclusive world economic system , the environmental dimension constitutes an opportunity rather than a barrier to investment and trade .  
To foster cooperation aimed at achieving the conservation and sustainable management of the regions natural ecosystems for the purpose of deepening world commitments to conserve biodiversity in situ and to work to establish sustainable development plans in those ecosystems which incorporate , at the local level , the agreements that figure in all the relevant conventions and that provide for the creation and reinforcement of protected areas and biological corridors and for the promotion of sustainable production activities .

Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences , and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Ensure access for all youth to all types of education , wherever appropriate , providing alternative learning structures , ensure that education reflects the economic and social needs of youth and incorporates the concepts of environmental awareness and sustainable development throughout the curricula ; and expand vocational training , implementing innovative methods aimed at increasing practical skills , such as environmental scouting ( para .  25.9 ( d ) ) ;  
Enhance mass media to spread information about sustainable development issues , specifically ideas for how to make a positive change from the personal to the international scale , and to become an educational tool through channels such as interconnected radio , television and the Internet ;  
The role of science and engineering in the current policy-making process at national and global levels regarding the three pillars of sustainable development social , economic and ecological is insufficient .  
Sixty scientific academies of the InterAcademy Panel on International Issues ( IAP ) in May 2000,5 stressed that scientific , technological and health capabilities can produce substantial progress over the next two decades towards a sustainable human future and that this progress will demand a threefold effort by the scientific and technological community : to promote the use of existing knowledge more widely and effectively ; to generate new knowledge and beneficial technologies ; and to work with Governments , international organizations and the private sector to promote a worldwide transition to sustainability .  
Participants in the World Conference of Scientific Academies , Tokyo , process are encouraged to examine these documents , as they provide a very valuable and detailed picture of the scientific and technological communitys views and commitments on a wide range of issues critical to sustainable development .  
A crucial role in the global governance of sustainable development that has found widespread acceptance since the 1992 Rio Conference has been played by the instrument of authoritative statements based on scientific assessments .  
More generally , science and technology are equally fundamental to pursuing solutions to human health and social issues , ranging from key human health questions such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) to sustainable transportation .  
The international scientific and technological community can provide assistance at the strategic level by contributing to the decision-making cycle in respect of : ( a ) proactively seeking opportunities , generating early warning , and finding new ways of understanding complex interdependent aspects of sustainable development ; ( b ) engaging extensively with policy formulation and implementation , by providing reliable information for setting policy goals ; and ( c ) helping policy evaluation by monitoring implementation , providing assessments of change , learning from experience , and integrating new information .  
Over the next five years , the scientific and technological community is committed to significantly enhancing the active participation of scientists and engineers within : national sustainable development commissions ; all levels of government , as advisers to heads of State , heads of international agencies , parliaments etc . ; and private sector boards of directors . 
Recognizes that the overall thrust of the new strategic vision of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme ( UN-Habitat ) and its emphasis on the two global campaigns on secure tenure and urban governance are strategic points of entry for the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , especially for guiding international cooperation in respect of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Thus , while providing information on the status of the UNCCD process , the reports should also contribute to the strengthening of the institutional and human capacities of national focal points and national coordinating bodies , thereby improving their ability to coordinate the work and to stimulate the further steps required for effective implementation of the UNCCD as an integral part of national efforts to promote sustainable development and global environmental protection .  
In identifying international cooperation as one of the critical social and economic dimensions in the effort to achieve sustainable development , particularly in developing countries , chapter 2 of Agenda 21 underlines the importance of the international economys providing a supportive international climate for realizing environmental and development goals by promoting sustainable development through trade liberalization and making trade and environment mutually supportive ( para .  2.3 ) .  
Although there had , indeed , been progress in raising awareness and in the codification of environmental law , the internal and external conditions were no more favourable for sustainable development than they had been in 1992 : poverty had increased , environmental degradation had worsened and the accelerated pace of globalization was creating problems of sustainability and equity .  
While the Johannesburg agenda was challenging and daunting , it offered a real chance to demonstrate the power of collaboration and to work for the common good , provided that all relevant actors in the United Nations system , Governments , businesses , urban and rural communities , rich and poor countries joined forces to overcome humanitys tremendous challenges and chose the path of sustainable development .  
The sustainable development and environmental protection objectives that the international community had set in Rio were still far from being achieved : environmental degradation continued on a global scale ; poverty remained a source of concern ; the gap between rich and poor countries continued to widen ; and overall consumption , production and pollutant and toxic substance emission practices remained inconsistent with a pattern of sustainable development .  
Tunisia was a signatory of most of the international conventions on environmental protection and had been among the first countries to implement the Rio Summit recommendations at the national level by setting up an institutional and legal framework for protection of the environment , establishing a national sustainable development committee , developing a national Agenda 21 programme and mainstreaming environmental protection into the various economic and social plans . 
He had called for a new solidarity based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility , in other words allowing for an adequate apportionment of the burden , bearing in mind the special responsibility of some countries which historically had accounted for a large portion of global resource use to ensure that the developing countries had the means for sustainable development .  
Concerning finance , the Ministers had highlighted the importance of meeting the targets for official development assistance , the need to encourage private sector participation in the promotion of sustainable development through appropriate incentives , ensuring that additional funds were available to the Global Environment Facility , the need for debt relief for highly indebted poor countries , and ensuring market access in developed countries for the exports of developing countries .  
Clearly , the preparatory process was already highlighting the concerns of the poor countries with respect to capacity-building , harnessing science for development , transferring technology and the inescapable need to set aside for sustainable development a level of funding in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility through concessional loans or foreign direct investment .  
In the next stages of the preparatory process , the emphasis of the debate would no doubt shift to the relationship between the environment and deepening poverty ; yet the Rio Summit had already exhausted and resolved the issue by stating in Agenda 21 that the economic , social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development were equally important .  
In that regard , it was highly advisable to avoid , during the first substantive session of the Preparatory Committee in January 2002 , perpetuating a culture which would lead either side to establish an unwarranted and inappropriate order of priority among the three pillars of sustainable development , namely , economic growth , social development and environmental protection .  
Poverty , which poses a fundamental challenge to sustainable development in the Arab world , requiring rational utilization of available resources , the creation of a suitable climate for investment both locally and regionally , the establishment of a mechanism of social solidarity at the national level , the achievement of integration among Arab States in various areas and the granting of priority to Arab labour to help curb unemployment and the spread of poverty ;  
Globalization and its consequences , which may limit the possibility of achieving sustainable development in the Arab region , and the need to set up the Arab region in line with its own economic and institutional conditions and create a strong Arab regional bloc based on the regions cultural , civilizational and economic constituents ;  
First : Achieving sustainable development in the Arab world requires the establishment of an integrated , common Arab strategy for improving the economic , social , health and living conditions of the Arab population and preserving the environment in the Arab region that takes into account historical and present conditions in the region and anticipated future changes and world developments with a view to realizing the following objectives :  
Implementing integrated policies for poverty reduction , primarily by facilitating adjustment to economic reform policies , raising professional qualification and general and technical education levels , creating work opportunities for nationals of Arab countries , rationalizing and making proper use of available resources , promoting social solidarity , creating practical solutions to the debt problem and strengthening the role and participation of the private sector and civil society in the formulation and implementation of sustainable development programmes ;  
Encouraging investment in and attracting capital to the Arab region , bearing in mind the social , economic and environmental objectives in sectoral plans , policies and programmes ; fostering new opportunities for bringing about sustainable development ; and limiting adverse effects on health and the environment ;  
An increase in the resources of the Global Environment Facility to match the level of official assistance to developing countries , in view of the Facilitys important role as a basic financing tool for environmental and development activities ; the allocation of more resources to assistance in the implementation of programmes under the relevant multilateral conventions ; the granting of fair and equal opportunities to all developing countries to take advantage of the Facility ; and the simplification of procedures for obtaining from it financing for sustainable development projects ;  
Combining , as appropriate , the increased use of renewable energy sources , more efficient use of energy , the use of advanced fossil fuel technologies and other [ Sustainable ] advanced technologies [ ] [ and nuclear technologies ] and the sustainable use of traditional energy resources , which could meet the growing needs of energy services [ in the longer term ] to achieve sustainable development ;  
Provide a forum for continued policy development and dialogue among Governments , which would involve international organizations and other interested parties , including major groups , as identified in Agenda 21 , to foster a common understanding on sustainable forest management and to address forest issues and emerging areas of priority concern in a holistic , comprehensive and integrated manner ;  
Increased application of United Nations global agreements at the national and local levels , including those within the Istanbul Declaration and the Habitat Agenda that promote sustainable human development in an urbanizing world , capacity-building and institutional development , as well as those included in Agenda 21 and under section 1.7 , Social and economic dimensions , of the Rio Declaration ; 
Implementation of small-scale productive activities , determined and designed by participating institutions , to provide people living in poverty in environmentally sensitive areas with opportunities for income generation through sustainable utilization of local resources .  
Strengthening the institutional and technological capacity to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development by increasing the ability of policy makers to formulate and implement relevant legislation and environmental management plans ;  
Continuing to make available financial resources from all sources , including new and additional resources on an adequate and predictable basis and technical or other resources and facilitating and financing access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , and supporting LDCs efforts in environmental protection in the context of sustainable development ;  
The decentralization that is occurring in many tropical countries can bring benefits to many poor rural people in heavily forested areas , including greater access to forest resources , but weak local technical capacity , limited national support and organizational problems among small-scale loggers undermine prospects for sustainable forest management .  
The report said the three northern European countries are most outstanding in the areas of " industrial network readiness " and " measures of sustainable development , " while the United States is ranked first in " improving the environment for innovation and R &amp; amp ; D , " an area most representative of economic growth and competitiveness , and in " creating an enterprise environment that is more conducive for private sector economy . "  
Wang Dongjin spoke at the 92nd International Labor Organization Conference , saying that facing the challenges and difficulties of globalization , developing countries should enact feasible economic and sustainable social developmental strategies according to their countries ' situations .  Advanced countries and international organizations should provide the developing countries with a more practical and effective technical assistance to raise their ability to participate in the globalization process , thus allowing them to enjoy fairly the fruits of economic globalization from which common prosperity and development of the world can be realized .  
and the major measures should conform to such requirements as strengthening macro-economic control and regulation , readjusting the structure of the economy , making sound arrangements for the state 's key constructions , taking earnest steps to improve the living standards of the people , enhancing the level of employment , providing sound social securities , and bringing about a sustainable growth . "  
main measures to be taken should meet the requirements of strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control , optimizing the economic structure , properly scheduling key state projects , truly improving the people 's livelihood , actively increasing employment , ensuring social insurance work , and ensuring sustainable development .  
and the major measures should meet the requirements for strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control , optimizing the economic structure , planning state key construction projects well , effectively improving people 's living standards , actively promoting employment , and succeeding in social security work and sustainable development .  
By cooperating with and serving others , Chongqing should solve well the problem of redundant industrial structure that is likely to occur during the course of developing the Western Region . By serving others , it should strengthen itself , attain the goal of " striving to turn Chongqing into an economic center on the upper reaches of the Chang Jiang put forward by General Secretary Jiang Zemin , and join the western provinces and autonomous regions in building a great economic circle of sustainable development in the Western Region .  
In light of Hainan 's actual conditions , we have defined " one province , two localities " as our industrial development strategy and the construction of Hainan to be a symbol of an ecological province as our sustainable development strategy .  We have also defined the strategy of promoting reform and development through opening to the outside world and the strategy of invigorating Hainan on the strength of science and education .  Hainan will make more rapid and steady strides with still firmer confidence .  
Having gone through the change from " getting rich overnight " to " working in the light of the reality , " many Hainan deputies said with deep reflection : Industrial structural adjustment must be carried out in the light of local conditions and we must be pragmatic .  Only by doing so can we achieve practical results and ensure sustainable economic and social development .  
With a high sense of political responsibility , CPPCC members discussed major agenda , put forward many constructive views and suggestions on the administration of the country according to law , reliance on science and technology to invigorate the nation , sustainable development , great development of China 's western regions , reform of the state-owned enterprise , tackling of poverty , social security , democratic supervision , dealing with corruption , and maintaining social stability .  
the vanguard zones of the socialist market economic structure ; and the demonstration zones of sustainable development , which will take the lead in achieving modernization characterized by basically prosperous economy , optimum structure , perfect facilities , beautiful environment , integrated urban and rural areas , sound legal system , and civilized society .  
The deterioration of the ecological environment is severely jeopardizing and hampering the sustainable development of our national economy and society .  Improving the ecological environment has become an urgent requirement of economic and social development and the effort to improve the people 's standard of living .  
Carrying out a positive fiscal policy , strengthening infrastructure construction , supporting agricultural basic construction and construction for the ecological environment , supporting economic restructuring , speeding up the development of hi-tech industry , revamping old industrial bases and traditional industries , practicing the policy of rejuvenating the nation through science and education and the strategy of sustainable development , and establishing a social security system all require corresponding increase of input and state financial support .  
At the beginning of 2000 , China 's national economy faced a new strategic mission , which was the structural adjustment of agriculture .  Many sharp contradictions exist among development and environmental protection , sustainable development and agricultural structural adjustment .  
China is a country with dense population and little cultivated land .  For a considerably long period of time , it will be difficult to change the basic trend in which population is increasing , and cultivated land is decreasing .  We must regard the protection of cultivated land as one of the major affairs affecting the national economy and the people 's livelihood as well as the country 's sustainable development , and must never slacken efforts in grasping it at any time .  
In the light of some important issues with which both Asia and Europe are commonly concerned , the Chinese side proposed to call a meeting of Asian and European environmental ministers , conduct cooperation in forest protection and sustainable scientific and technological developments between Asia and Europe , call a symposium of the law enforcing organizations of Asian and European countries to crack down on transnational crimes , and other cooperation propositions , which obtained the support from all the Asian and European countries .  
If we say that since the 1963 National Agro-technology Conference , we have solved the problem of increasing agricultural output , then this session of the National Agro-technology Conference made a strategic adjustment to the direction of the development of agro-technology .  It sets the direction for the development of agricultural technology with optimizing the structure of agriculture , raising agricultural efficiency , improving the rural ecological environment , and strengthening capabilities in the sustainable development of agriculture as the main points for resolving the problem of developing agricultural efficiency .  
We should excel at understanding historical development trends and walk on the cutting edge of the times .  We should also be skillful in basing everything in reality , formulating the correct policies and strategies for development and be consistently innovative in theory , systems , science and technology in order to develop every project in modernization construction in a health , fast and sustainable way in the new century .  
During the process of completing the " 863 " research topics , the scientific and technological personnel throughout the army as well as scientific research administrations at all levels have also carried out bold practices in the field of high-tech management .  Today , they have opened up a new path for high-tech research and development which requires less input but can yield a higher economic efficiency , and have laid a solid foundation for a sustainable development in the future .  
He said , through thejoint efforts of the international community , effective international rulesshould be drawn up on the basis of full participation and democraticconsultation by all countries , to ensure that globalization can help to narrowthe disparities between north and south and between rich and poor , help topromote common development , help the developing countries to benefit fromglobalization , and help to promote balanced , steady , and sustainable worldeconomic development .  
Jiang Chunyun emphasized that during the " 10th 5-Year Plan " sustainable development must be made more of a priority and propaganda efforts on the situation of national resources , and the basic national policies , laws , and regulations on protecting natural resources must be greatly intensified in order to strengthen people 's resource hardship consciousness and environmental protection consciousness .  
It is necessary to actively promote legal administration , to intensify law enforcement inspections , to strengthen law enforcement oversight , to firmly implement the principles of following existing laws , strict law enforcement , and tracking down offenses against the law , to curb waste and destruction of resources , and to effectively improve the ecological environment in order to provide effective guarantees for sustainable economic and social development .  
In order to consolidate the good momentum of a turnaround in the economy this year and comprehensively size up the situation , China will continue to practice an active fiscal policy : First , we will issue 150-billion yuan worth of long-term construction bonds , with the focus on investment in sectors with the nature of " public items " such as infrastructure , environmental protection , and science and education ; we will increase effective domestic demand and also promote economic restructuring , innovation in science and technology , and sustainable development .  
The " 10th Five-Year Plan " for tackling key scientific and technological issues will focus over 60 percent of S &amp; T funding on surmounting a host of integrative technological issues that have the greatest effect on spurring industrial technological upgrades and sustainable social development , issues that cover a broad area , and that relate to high-level core technology and associated equipment .  
Major projects manifest the first principle of national goals on a high level , taking their point of departure from solving problems related to the demands of national economic construction and sustainable social development , with a focus on surmounting major technological problems .  
Guiding projects take major local projects that conform to the direction and conditions of national plans to tackle key scientific and technological problem and that have a stimulating effect on local leading industries and sustainable social development , or those that can improve local capabilities for technological innovation , and lists them in the national plans for tackling key scientific and technological problems for guidance and implementation .  The funding to implement guiding projects is to be raised primarily by the localities and businesses .  
We must fully understand the protracted , arduous and complicated nature of pollution management and environmental improvement , and maintain healthy , stable and sustainable economic growth in our region .  A the same time , we must make efforts to do a good job at environmental protection .  
Last year , in the course of formulating Beijing Municipality 's tenth five-year plan for economic and social development , the draft was twice discussed at the standing committee of the municipal political consultation conference .  Members of the political consultation conference provided many useful and constructive opinions on the general framework of the tenth five-year plan , the strategy for the capital 's sustainable development , urban construction and management , and spiritual civilization development .  
" Everyone has a right to decent housing " and " sustainable development of habitat for humanity " , the two objectives put forward by the United Nations , are in line with those in China 's national and economic development plan .  China has put in tremendous efforts to realize those objectives , achieved rapid development in housing construction , and improved urban environment .  The United Nations appreciates China 's achievements and the UNCHS has issued awards to China many times .  
It is implementing the reform and opening up policy that spurred the national economy to develop in a sustainable , rapid and healthy manner and raised the social and productive forces , overall national strength and people 's standard of living to higher levels .  
After the establishment of New China , China 's athletic project has developed rapidly .  Particularly during the 20 years since the implementation of the reform and opening up policy , China 's national economy has developed in a sustainable , rapid and healthy manner ; the social and productive forces , the overall national strength , people 's life and the athletic level have been greatly improved .  
To reverse the situation in which many public resources ( especially those resources that do not regenerate and those whose growth periods are too long ) are overly exploited , and thus achieve sustainable economic development , a simple and effective measure is to grant the property rights of these resources to individuals or enterprises , clearing their property rights .  
to try hard to bring about sustainable development .  We must vigorously enhance the quality of workers and promote economic development by relying on the deepening of the reform and on scientific and technological advancement and paying particular attention to making a good job of reforming state-owned enterprises and enhancing their vitality .  
An official of the education department of the Chinese Embassy in London also revealed that while Chinese environmental scientists in Britain were working in China , leaders of some local governments seemed outmoded in their thinking and tried to seek instant success , rendering unwelcome some high-tech projects designed to achieve sustainable development , especially some environmental protection research projects .  He said this phenomenon should be improved as quickly as possible .  
We should adhere to the basic national policies of family planning , environmental protection , and energy conservation , increase the intensity of implementing the sustainable development strategy , control the population growth , protect and construct ecological environment , and economize on and effectively use resources so that economic and social development is genuinely built on the bases of continuous progress of science and technology , rational utilization of resources , and constant improvement of ecological environment .

Governments at the appropriate level , with the support of regional , subregional and international organizations , should , where necessary , enhance institutional capability to promote the multiple roles and functions of all types of forests and vegetation inclusive of other related lands and forest-based resources in supporting sustainable development and environmental conservation in all sectors .  
Recognize and foster the traditional methods and the knowledge of indigenous people and their communities , emphasizing the particular role of women , relevant to the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of biological resources , and ensure the opportunity for the participation of those groups in the economic and commercial benefits derived from the use of such traditional methods and knowledge ;  
To identify and strengthen or develop , as required , in particular in developing countries , the appropriate institutional , legal and financial mechanisms to ensure that water policy and its implementation are a catalyst for sustainable social progress and economic growth .  
To consider developing and issuing by the year 2000 a strategy of changes necessary to eliminate constitutional , legal , administrative , cultural , behavioural , social and economic obstacles to women 's full participation in sustainable development and in public life ;  
Ensure access for all youth to all types of education , wherever appropriate , providing alternative learning structures , ensure that education reflects the economic and social needs of youth and incorporates the concepts of environmental awareness and sustainable development throughout the curricula ; and expand vocational training , implementing innovative methods aimed at increasing practical skills , such as environmental scouting ;  
This was a matter dealt with by the World Conference , which recognized the need for a continuing adaptation of the United Nations human rights machinery to the current and future needs in the promotion and protection of human rights , as reflected in the Vienna Declaration and within the framework of balanced and sustainable development .  
The World Conference recognized the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society and strongly reaffirms the commitment of the international community to their economic , social and cultural well-being and their enjoyment of the fruits of sustainable development .  
Reaffirming that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and the preparedness against natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment , and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
Also reaffirms that such a dialogue should be conducted in response to the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development as well as improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development , and that the United Nations system should play a central role in facilitating such a dialogue ;  
In particular , the global POPIN Coordinating Unit and the regional Population Information Networks are working towards harnessing the tremendous potential of print , audiovisual and electronic media , including databases and networks , to disseminate technical information and to promote and strengthen understanding of relationships between population , consumption , production and sustainable development .  
Reaffirms the importance of creating a new model of regional security based on a reasonable balance of forces , the pre-eminence of civil authority , the elimination of extreme poverty , the promotion of sustainable development , the protection of the environment and the eradication of violence , corruption , terrorism and trafficking in drugs and arms , a commitment made at the fifteenth meeting of Central American Presidents ;  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity , and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reiterating the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources ,  
Actions are recommended to create , in a framework of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , a national and international environment favourable to social development , to eradicate poverty , to enhance productive employment and reduce unemployment , and to foster social integration .  
Governments increasingly recognize that their responses to changing circumstances and their desires to achieve sustainable development and social progress will require increased solidarity , expressed through appropriate multilateral programmes and strengthened international cooperation .  
The promotion of mutually reinforcing broad based sustained economic growth and sustainable development on a global scale , as well as growth in production , non-discriminatory and multilateral rule-based international trading system , employment and incomes as a basis for social development [ requires ] the following actions at the national [ and / or ] international level :  
Implementing sound and stable macroeconomic and sectoral policies which encourage broad-based , sustained economic growth and development that is sustainable and equitable , generate jobs , and that are geared towards eradicating poverty , reducing social and economic inequalities and exclusion ;  
Implementing measures to open market opportunities for all , especially people living in poverty and the disadvantaged , and to encourage individuals and communities to take economic initiatives , innovate and invest in activities that contribute to social development while promoting broad based sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure sustainable livelihoods ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
Strengthening international data collection and statistical systems to support countries in monitoring social development goals ; and encouraging the expansion of international databases to incorporate socially beneficial activities not included in available data , such as women 's unremunerated work and contributions to society , the informal economy , and sustainable livelihoods ;  
Pursuing the coordination of macroeconomic policies so that they are mutually reinforcing and conducive to broad-based and sustained economic growth and sustainable development , as well as substantial increases in productive employment expansion and a decline in unemployment worldwide ;  
Implementing macroeconomic and microeconomic policies in accordance with national priorities and policies , aimed at encouraging greater domestic savings and investment required for public spending , through progressive , fair and economically efficient taxes which are cognizant of sustainable development concerns , and through cutting back on subsidies that do not benefit the poor ;  
Inviting the international community , including the international financial institutions , to continue to explore ways of implementing additional and innovative measures to alleviate substantially the debt burdens of developing countries , in particular of the highly indebted low-income countries , in order to help them to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development without falling into a new debt crisis ;  
Constraints are removed and incentives provided to ensure that desirable land uses are encouraged and are profitable ; land users have legal title to their land ; legal and tax systems do not result in disincentives to increased and sustainable land use ; adequate market and physical infrastructure are available ; the disadvantages and inequalities which particularly apply to women are remedied ;  
Mindful of the need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for sustainable development through , inter alia , policies for the promotion of domestic savings , improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels ,  
Urges the international community to increase financial resource flows to Africa , as these are crucial in order to regenerate the growth and sustainable development of the African economies , to provide effective support to the political and economic reforms in which many African countries are now engaged and to help cushion adverse social consequences ;  
We commit ourselves to attaining the goals of universal and equitable access to quality education and to basic health services , without distinction by race , national origin , gender or age , and to preserving and promoting our rich and varied cultural heritage , as indispensable bases for people-centred sustainable development . 
However , can market forces ( a ) set an agricultural research agenda that though increasingly dominated by private commercial interests is oriented towards developing sustainable technologies , and ( b ) exert demand pressure for organic products so as to promote a significant shift towards more environment-friendly production practices ?  
They typically possess limited institutional and human resource capacity to assess the implications for sustainable agricultural and rural development of ongoing developmental plans .  
It seeks to foster development of sustainable agricultural production systems and to ensure that the following elements of sustainability are incorporated in the formulation and implementation of Bank-financed projects : increased and stabilized productivity ; rational use of natural resources ; enhancement of the quality of life and the environment ; and intergenerational equity .  
Within the changing context of sustainable development , developmental efforts should be able to pay its full costs , that is , the environmental and social costs ; for this reason resources have to be priced at or equal to the marginal value or scarcity rent and incorporated into development-related decision-making .  
Taking note of Economic and Social Council resolution 1994 / 51 of 3 November 1994 , in which the Council emphasized that the advancement of women should be an integral part of the economic and social development process within the main global issues , such as women 's particupation in the peace process , in national and international governance , sustainable development and gender equality ,  
The initiative aims to design sustainable natural resource management options to combat land degradation using indigenous and modern scientific principles integrated into improved production technologies .  
At the Paris ceremony , AfDB committed itself to play an active part in implementing the Convention , in line with the important role assigned to it under the provisions of the Convention , particularly in terms of integrated activities in key areas such as improving national economic environments , the sustainable use of natural resources , efficient energy use , capacity-building and sensitization .  
The objectives and activities contained in chapter 15 of Agenda 21 represent , therefore , a formidable challenge to Governments and relevant United Nations bodies , major groups and non-governmental organizations , among others , to improve the conservation of biological diversity and promote the sustainable use of biological resources , as well as to support the Convention on Biological Diversity and other relevant agreements in a coordinated and integrated manner .  
The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ( CGIAR ) continued to carry out research in partnership with national , regional and international genetic resources programmes as a means of strengthening the scientific basis for its work encompassing in situ and ex situ conservation and the sustainable use of plant , livestock and aquatic genetic resources .  
In the statement , the Conference noted that the Convention on Biological Diversity was the primary international legal instrument for advancing the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources .  
It decided to establish an open-ended ad hoc group of experts to consider without undue delay the need for and modalities of a protocol , containing appropriate procedures to be followed in the field of the safe transfer , handling and use of any living modified organism resulting from biotechnology that might have an adverse effect on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
The international scientific community , in cooperation with Governments , entities within the United Nations system , and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations , need to make efforts to develop economic tools for determining the costs and benefits of the conservation of biodiversity and sustainable use of biological resources , and their distribution at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The main priorities of the programme on natural resources address issues relating to knowledge , the utilization and conservation of biological resources and diversity , the assessment of standing vegetation and its present and potential contribution to agricultural productivity , and the establishment of sustainable farming systems .  
sustainable use at various levels : the ecosystems / biogeographic realms level ( forests , arid zones , oceans , freshwater etc . ) ; the species level ( wildlife ) ; genetic resources level ( plant , animal and microbial resources , and natural resources economics ) ; the processes level ( biotechnology ) ; the monitoring and assessment level ; and the legal level .  
ECA provides advisory services and support to its member States on agriculture and rural development policies , planning and programming , with a focus on measures for the conservation of natural forests and their biodiversity , desertification and the related conservation of biodiversity , the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems and green belts in targeted countries , and the strengthening of regional cooperation programmes for the optimum and sustainable use of inland and marine fisheries .  
The Joint FAO / ECE Working Party on Relations between Agriculture and the Environment currently examines various aspects and national practices related to biological diversity and landscape protection as part of its work-plan element entitled Economic , legal , technological and regulatory measures for the promotion of environmentally sustainable agriculture and production of healthy food " .  
Emphasizing that the advancement of women should be an integral part of the economic and social development process within the main global issues , such as gender equality and women 's participation in the peace process , in national and international governance and in sustainable development ,  
The prevalence of absolute and relative poverty in mountainous regions and the downstream consequences of the degradation of mountain ecosystems are recognized as major reasons for mobilizing international efforts to assist countries 2 / to formulate and implement strategies for sustainable mountain development .  
It is expected that the regional intergovernmental workshops planned in preparation for a proposed world conference on sustainable mountain development in 1997 ( see para . 75 below ) will alert Governments and national agencies to the needs and potential for special national mountain agendas .  
In general , it was noted that the main factors constraining the development of sustainable national capacities include ( a ) the absence of an enabling public sector environment ; ( b ) the lack of a critical mass of suitably trained and motivated counterparts ; ( c ) high turnover ; and ( d ) the non-fulfilment of national budgetary and in-kind commitments .  
Other areas in which some progress has been made include the consideration of biological diversity ; the reservation of more primary forests ; the use of multi-purpose native species ; less regimented planting and management regimes for landscape and other environmental purposes ; the clear inclusion of forestry concerns into national sustainable development strategies ; and broadening end-use objectives beyond timber production to ecosystem management to sustain multiple benefits .  
Such results need to be made more accessible to low-income farming communities , farmers and forest-dependent peoples in developing countries so as to help enhance their sustainable livelihoods ; for that purpose , modern scientific and technological practices may need to build more systematically upon indigenous or local knowledge and practice .  
In chapter 2 and elsewhere in Agenda 21 , it was also agreed that sustainable development would require domestic reforms and international assistance in such areas as economic development , improved market access and commodity prices , environmental management , technology transfer , financing ( debt relief , foreign investment , official development assistance ) and institutional capacity-building .  
The Board held extensive deliberations on its future work , including a full exchange of views with the Secretary-General , who requested the Board to provide guidance on how the theme of sustainable development might be incorporated in each of the several forthcoming major conferences , and how the action programmes that emerged could be more effectively implemented .  
It identified five areas upon which efforts should be concentrated : economic restructuring that empowered women , creating sustainable livelihoods , building stable lives and healthy communities , peace building and conflict resolution , and ethical governance and respect for civil society .  
The criteria ( attached as annex II ) reflect the following top sustainable human development priorities for UNDP cooperation with Bangladesh : relevance to country programme objectives ; institutional and social sustainability ; environmental sensitivity ; targeting of the chronically poor ; affirmative action for women ; public management ; participation of beneficiaries and private organizations ; and national execution .  
Also emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic recovery and growth of the world economy , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ,  
In the area of poverty alleviation , sustainable human development will have to be promoted at the local level through support of the decentralization process and a strengthening of the technical , managerial and administrative capacity of local bodies , particularly departmental development councils and municipalities .  
The Convention on Biological Diversity is the primary international legal instrument for advancing the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of genetic resources , while recognizing the important role of other conventions to the objectives of the Convention .  
It would also be desirable that future work on the protection of traditional knowledge and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant to conservation and sustainable use should be coordinated with the relevant bodies .  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in zones under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly the developing countries ,  
To summarize , the exact content and quantitative objectives of a Tunisian policy on sustainable human development , which will be reflected in the country strategy note , will emerge from the process of formulating Tunisia 's Agenda 21 and strategic studies conducted in the context of preparations for the ninth plan .  
Taking into account that the Economic and Social Council , in its resolution 1994 / 51 , emphasized that the advancement of women should be an integral part of the economic and social development process within the main global issues , such as gender equality and women 's participation in the peace process , in national and international governance and in sustainable development ,  
Acknowledging that there are links , under certain circumstances , between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , in countries affected by the illicit drug problem , that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Stressing the importance of trade as a major instrument of economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular developing countries and the need to find solutions to microeconomic issues of international trade which can significantly contribute to more open , dynamic and efficient trade relations ,  
Women , particularly through non-governmental organizations , participated in global , regional , national and community forums and strongly influenced the international debates on environmental management and conservation , human rights , violence against women , population and sustainable development , economic expansion and science and technology .  
Also encourages the above-mentioned organizations to contribute fully to increasing world awareness of the problems and potential of human settlements as important inputs to social progress and economic growth , and world leaders to commit themselves to making cities , towns and villages in their countries healthy , safe , just and sustainable ;  
Recognizing the important role that Governments and public administrations can play in addressing new responsibilities arising from the pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , including , inter alia , developing basic infrastructural facilities , promoting social development , combating socio-economic disparities and poverty , preparing , as appropriate , conditions for the private sector and protecting the environment ,  
By including this programme area in chapter 35 of Agenda 21 , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) recognized that development and natural resources management will be sustainable only if it is based on sound science , using the best scientific knowledge available and with continued research to improve the knowledge base .  
In addition to the financial means provided for this purpose , a number of United Nations bodies and organizations , including FAO , UNESCO , UNIDO and UNEP , have spent a considerable share of their regular programme funds on supporting programmes and activities related to science for sustainable development and scientific capacity-building in developing countries .  
Given the serious lack of resources and qualified personnel in the least developed countries , a realistic short to medium-term strategy for building scientific and technological capacity to manage the transition to sustainable development would be to concentrate on subregional measures rather than national ones .  
The Commission may wish to address appropriate measures to increasing financing for priority actions at the national level related to science for sustainable development , in particular scientific capacity-building in developing countries , and to formulate recommendations addressed to multilateral and bilateral donor agencies and Governments , as well as specific funding mechanisms , such as the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) .  
The new forces of modern science and technology , if harnessed properly and applied in accordance with each country 's particular socio-economic and cultural circumstances , offer immense possibilities for solving many of the complicated problems that are currently impeding economic , social and environmentally sound and sustainable development in the developing countries .  
The science addressed in chapter 35 is intended to provide the knowledge base for sustainable development and must therefore be designed to cover all facets of the complex problems of environment and development as they appear at the global , regional , and local levels .  
Despite considerable efforts , many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , do not yet possess a critical mass of trained personnel in specialized fields and in interdisciplinary approaches related to sustainable development .  
Recognizing that in many scientific fields related to sustainable development , such as climate change , the human dimensions of global environmental change , the global hydrological cycle , the assessment of freshwater resources , and oceans and regional seas , the generation of new knowledge needs enhanced international scientific cooperation , Governments , international organizations and the scientific community should join efforts towards : 
The concept of sustainable development is based on the conviction that it should be possible to increase the basic standard of living of the world 's growing population without unnecessarily depleting our finite natural resources and further degrading the environment in which we live .  
The private sector needs to be actively encouraged to contribute to efforts to work towards sustainable development through the development and use of environmentally sound biotechnologies that balance social , environmental and economic objectives and the dissemination of reliable and accurate information to the public .  
Action is urgently needed to facilitate the effective participation of developing countries in the process directed towards adopting realistic and up-to-date standards for intellectual property rights on biotechnology , taking into consideration new advances in and the understanding of biotechnology , as well as its crucial role in sustainable development , its potential impact on human society , and opportunities for mutually beneficial collaboration and cooperation .  
To encourage environmentally sustainable agricultural practices while moving away from overdependence on agrochemicals , UNEP , in collaboration with FAO , UNESCO and other relevant organizations , supported the regional Microbial Resources Centres ( MIRCENs ) in Cairo , Nairobi , Dakar , and Porto Alegre in demonstrating on a pilot scale the use of biological nitrogen fixation ( BNF ) for enhancing soil fertility and increasing legume production at the small-farm level .  
Adjustment programmes are designed to promote both macroeconomic stabilization and structural reform , and thereby to lay the foundations for high quality growth - a prerequisite for a sustainable and equitable improvement in living standards .  
Nevertheless , several countries state that in order to have a more sustainable impact , legal literacy should include developing an awareness of rights in general and of existing national statutory rights in particular , since penal and civil codes protect everyone .  
In fact such local-level agencies have emerged as a new locus of economic and social growth , providing innovative institutional arrangements through which family planning , health , education and income-generating activities can be integrated at the local level , ensuring environmentally sensitive sustainable development on a limited scale .  
Encourage major groups working in the population / gender field and in other sustainable development fields to increase their communication , cooperation and coordination at the local , regional and international levels in order to reinforce their contribution to the mutual understanding of these issues and to facilitate their active participation in the implementation of chapter 5 of Agenda 21 and chapter III of the Programme of Action ;  
They are relevant to decision-making by popularizing areas related to sustainable development and thus helping to create an informed public ; by providing technical data for scientists , engineers and other trained cadres who rely on these inputs for the analysis and recommendations that feed into the political process ; and by suggesting broad goals , objectives and policy options for discussion at intergovernmental forums .  
It would be desirable for the Commission to discuss more deeply the current and prospective role of the private sector in this regard , develop policy options for enlarging its role and explore the potential of related innovative mechanisms such as co-financing and venture capital funds , in particular for leveraging ODA and public expenditures on sustainable development .  
The purpose of integrated plans and strategies is to develop a consensual vision for the future and to identify common priority issues and key activities within a framework that provides for consensus-building and planning and the creation of the institutional support required for sustainable development .  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
[ Sustained economic growth and sustainable development can only be attained through improving the economic , social , political , legal and cultural status of women . ]  
Pursue and implement sound and stable macroeconomic and sectoral policies , designed with the full and equal participation of women , that encourage broad-based sustained economic growth [ in the context of people-centred sustainable development ] [ sustainable development centred on human beings ] , address the structural causes of poverty and are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing gender-based inequality ;  
One organization asserted that this recommendation was unfortunately silent on existing mechanisms for inter-agency meetings on public information issues covering high-priority agenda items such as social and economic development , crime prevention and criminal justice , human rights , environment and sustainable development , women and development , population and refugees .  
Use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting of country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to mobilize more efficiently new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .  
The Working Group recognized that joint studies on some form of international cooperation , keeping in mind the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities , could help overcome concerns about international competitiveness as a result of unilateral implementation of domestic policy reforms aimed at promoting sustainable development .  
Investing in formal and non-formal education and training for girls and women , with its exceptionally high social and economic return , has proved to be one of the best means of achieving [ sustained economic growth and ] [ sustainable development ] [ centred on the human person ] and for eradicating poverty . tertiary education has increased considerably . 
Within the concept of sustainable development , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) emphasized the relationship between the economic and social aspects of development and the use of resources , considering the environment as a " sink " , absorbing negative impacts of human activities , and as a " source " , providing resource inputs into productive processes or providing final environmental services directly .  
Among such new approaches are the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , including foreign direct investment ; improved coordination and cooperation among national institutions in recipient and donor countries , on the basis of national sustainable development strategies ; partnership arrangements ; and networking between scientific institutes active in the field of sustainable development in various countries and regions .  
Governments have a responsibility to provide the necessary enabling environment , guiding markets and investments so that they operate in a manner compatible with national economic , social and environmental objectives and international trade arrangements and facilitate sustainable development .  
It was appreciated that the report of the Secretary-General on sustainable mountain development ( E / CN . 17 / 1995 / 5 ) , in addition to technical aspects , also covered the social , economic and cultural aspects of human development in mountain areas .  
Concerning the proposals for action , the Working Group suggested that the Commission consider encouraging countries , with the support of the international community , to prepare and initiate implementation of comprehensive national mountain development programmes and to strengthen national capacity for sustainable mountain development using a participatory approach involving all stakeholders , including local and indigenous communities and non-governmental organizations .  
The Working Group recognized that the Convention on Biological Diversity , which has now entered into force , will be the principal mechanism for advancing the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and provides an excellent basis for coordinating relevant instruments .  
Particular attention and recognition should be given to the role and the special situation of women living in rural areas and those working in the agricultural sector , where access to training , land , natural and productive resources , credit , development programmes and cooperative structures can help them increase their participation in sustainable development .  
Support the development of women 's equal access to housing infrastructure , safe water , sustainable and affordable energy technologies , such as wind , solar , biomass and other renewable sources , through participatory needs assessments , energy planning and policy formulation at the local and national levels ;  
Sustainable development and economic growth that is both sustained and sustainable is only possible through improving the economic , social , political , legal and cultural status of women .  
Implement sound macroeconomic and sectoral policies , designed and monitored with the full participation of women , that encourage broad-based sustained economic growth in the context of [ people-centred ] sustainable development [ centred on human beings ] , address the structural causes of poverty and are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing gender-based inequality . 
At its fiftieth session , the Commission established as the theme topic for its fifty-first session , to be held in April 1995 , " Strengthening regional cooperation in human resources development , with special reference to the social implications of sustainable economic growth in Asia and the Pacific " .  
Poverty has various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure sustainable livelihoods ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increased morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; and social discrimination and exclusion .  
As stated in the guidelines and rules of procedure for the Seminar ( A / AC . 109 / 1107 ) , its primary objective was to review economic and social conditions in the Non-Self-Governing Territories of the Caribbean region and identify areas in which the international community could increase and enhance its participation in programmes of assistance and development and adopt a comprehensive and integrated approach to ensure the viable and sustainable development of the Territories concerned .  
Activities planned for 1996-1997 are expected to result in ( a ) a knowledge base upon which management strategies and plans can be formulated and implementation initiated to ensure the protection and sustainable development of marine and coastal areas ; and ( b ) establishment of mechanisms and policy options for the development of environmental protection and sustainable management and plans .  
The subprogramme , in collaboration with United Nations organizations and international and national research institutions , aims at promoting the further development and application integrated environmental and economic analysis instruments , as well as national , regional and international programmes and policies for sound environmental management and sustainable development .  
Research on " Caspian , Aral and Dead Sea Water Crisis and Perspectives " has been aimed at providing a comprehensive and objective environmental management setting for sustainable development , taking into account international political considerations and conflict resolution .  State-of-the-art research papers for the Forum have been commissioned , and a long-term field research programme is being designed as a part of the present project .  
A second programme : " Applications of biotechnology for development " is presently a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacities in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life . 
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  They thus provide a forum and a network for cooperation among their member States and between them and other States at the technical level .  
In this context , technical cooperation provided at the request of Governments will seek to ensure an integrated and effective approach to economic and social development within the framework of the overall economic and social development priorities , policies and plans of the developing countries and within the orientations of sustainable human development , as well as , where appropriate , within the context of the peace-to-development continuum .  
The Pacific island countries and the donor community are now faced with the challenge of translating these strategies into concrete action at the country level , with a need to generate broad-based economic growth while making judicious , sustainable use of the limited natural resource base and ensuring a balance of the fragile ecosystems .  
In an era of financial stringency , the limited resources available to assist developing countries must be directed prudently towards those investments with the highest payoff ; experience in country after country demonstrates that water and sanitation improvements are vital to economic progress and , more broadly , provide the very foundations for sustainable human development .  
An innovative programme has been designed to assist indigenous peoples in developing their own strategies , based on traditional knowledge , for the sustainable exploitation of biodiversity and habitat preservation while yielding economic benefits for the support of local populations .  
The concept of sustainable human development marks an important advance in the global search for a new way of ordering human affairs - a way that is equitable to both current and future generations in all parts of the world , one that will ensure that future generations inherit a natural resource base at least as viable as that of earlier generations .  
Executive Board decision 94 / 14 synthesized and built on a decade of gradual reform , 1 / providing UNDP with the three principal goals of ( a ) strengthening international cooperation for sustainable human development ; ( b ) helping the United Nations family to become a unified and powerful force for human development ; and ( c ) focusing UNDP resources on making the maximum contribution in its programme countries to key SHD dimensions .  
It emphasized national-level participation of major groups in the implementation and monitoring of Agenda 21 inter alia , through national coordinating mechanisms , including national councils on sustainable development or national networks of major groups , and recommended that such participation needed to be further encouraged , strengthened and expanded . 
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance ( ODA ) is a main source of external funding ; substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
The use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external financial resources , through various innovative schemes ( such as co-financing and joint ventures , underwriting country risks , and venture capital funds ) in order to more efficiently mobilize new financial flows for sustainable development from all potential sources .  
The transfer of environmentally sound technology , on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 , in accordance with chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , is highlighted by the Commission as having a particularly important role to play in realizing the goals of sustainable development .  
For the sustainable development of ocean resources in the context of the international ocean regime , priority will be given to the needs of States for specialized data and information for developing integrated national , subregional or regional information systems on marine areas within national jurisdiction and for putting in place appropriate legislative frameworks .  
The main areas of focus involve debt and resource flows ; commodities and diversification ; structural adjustment programmes and policy reforms ; sustained and sustainable development ; population ; environment and development ; regional cooperation and integration ; export performance ; and problems of the least developed , land-locked and island developing countries , as well as related technical cooperation activities .  External relations .  
Seminars and workshops on the functions and impact of international , regional and bilateral arrangements ; country experience studies ; harmonization of foreign direct investment reporting systems ; incorporation of sustainable development management practices into national policies ; and enhancement of national strategies for sustainable development as they relate to transnational corporations .  
The activities under this subprogramme will aim at strengthening the capability of ESCAP members and associate members in environmental and natural resource management ; integration of environmental considerations into economic policy decision-making ; transfer of environmentally sound technologies ; sustainable rural and urban development ; population and sustainable development ; and natural disaster reduction .  
Services on economic reforms in the least developed countries ; economic and financial management in Pacific island developing countries ; demographic issues in the Pacific island developing countries ; institutional capability-building , including private sector development for the promotion of industrial investment and technology transfer ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( b ) Group training , including seminars and workshops .  
The envisaged cooperation aims at supporting efforts of the member States of the two organizations to promote regional cooperation and sustainable human development through programmes and activities designed to mobilize and enhance human resources , to promote the environmentally sound use of natural and mineral resources and raise the living standards of the peoples in the countries concerned .  
The World Summit for Social Development was remarkable in its scope : it gave a comprehensive meaning to social development , encompassing the functioning of society and all institutions for the overall objective of the betterment of the human condition and it placed people at the centre of all concerns and policies for sustainable development , proclaiming that all human beings are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with the environment .  
Several delegations considered that UNEP 's regional offices could play a useful role in helping developing countries to strengthen their capacity to implement Agenda 21 .  5 / Some delegations stressed that the role of UNEP in providing information on sustainable development should be concentrated on environmental aspects of such development and that such information should be prepared upon the request of Governments .  
These included : empowerment of women as an overall concept ; mass media ; statistics and indicators on gender issues ; natural resources and sustainable development : water , waste management and sanitation ; renewable energy ; and issues related to different groups of female population such as the ageing , displaced ; refugees and migrants .  50 .  The Board decided that INSTRAW should introduce the following in its new programme , among other subjects :

Those results will then need to be integrated into a clear set of conclusions and policy recommendations for advancing international understanding and consensus on forest issues : on that basis , the Panel is expected to propose coherent approaches to addressing the problem of the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests .  
For example , significant advances have been made on national reporting and on better understanding of sustainable forest management , particularly by formulating a set of compatible criteria and indicators applicable to the boreal , temperate and tropical forests .

The solution should also be a comprehensive one based on prevention , mitigation of damage to the environment and the search for sustainable solutions , which should be based on the political will to protect , defend and promote human rights , guarantee the participation of citizens in government and create an enabling environment for economic and social progress .

Redraft paragraph 8.3 as follows : " The main objectives of the Department will be the promotion of an integrated approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of development , including the elaboration of perspectives that will provide for sustainable , equitable and participatory development .  
Modernizing public administration in order to establish clear parameters for a modern , innovative civil service must include among its priorities the updating of the private sector and enhancing the ability to compete in foreign markets , while taking into account the economic and social balance required and ensuring sustainable development and employment .  
It is equally important for Governments to facilitate the development of productive sectors ; mobilize national energies and resources for the provision of human capital and institution-building , infrastructure and basic social services ; develop long-term analysis , planning and evaluation ; promote sustainable development and equitable distribution of growth benefits ; and ensure the coordination of all development activities .  
Significant political and economic changes are taking place all over the world , characterized by , among other things , a growing concern for democratization and good governance , by the increasing resort to privatization and greater reliance on market forces , by an enhanced awareness of the need to mobilize domestic resources and reduce fiscal deficits , by growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes and by greater recognition of the need to ensure that development is not only sustainable but also environmentally sound .  
At the same time , it is necessary to recognize what the Secretary General 's report points out : that the challenges which Governments worldwide face in establishing a framework of public administration and a financial system for sustainable economic development are not just domestic influences , but are also unpredictable external factors .  
Indeed , it is impossible to conceive of global and sustainable economic and social progress based on fairness and solidarity without a comprehensive and coherent concept of cooperation for development including , as the Secretary-General has recalled , a vital ethical element and without conception and coordination here in the United Nations in way that is not disjointed , scattered and possibly inconsistent .  How can we give the United Nations sufficient authority and credibility to consider effectively in this forum major global economic issues ?  
We should also remember that durable peace and sustainable development on a global scale can not be achieved unless all countries secure adequate living standards for their populations and overcome unemployment , poverty , social disintegration and environmental pollution .  
It is needless to stress that the elimination of poverty and the attainment of the broader goal of sustainable development will remain impossible to achieve unless nations show renewed political resolve to implement policies aimed at enabling humankind to better manage and live with its environment , as agreed to at the Rio de Janeiro summit and at subsequent Conferences .  
Can we refocus our energies on the four priorities of stemming the spread of weapons of mass destruction , bolstering United Nations peacekeeping and peace-building capabilities , advancing sustainable economic and social development , and reinforcing our joint commitment to international law and human rights ? 
Myanmar truly believes that we can overcome the political , economic and social challenges we face and avoid confrontation and chaos only if we seize the opportunity to extend and strengthen the Organization and promote a multilateral system based on the primacy of international law and freedom of choice and equality of all States .

The Government of Bolivia 's current efforts are essentially based on the consolidation of participatory democratic institutions and on the conviction that economic development must be compatible with care for nature and the environment in other words , that this must take place within the framework of sustainable development and of respect for ethnic and cultural diversity , in order to make unity in diversity possible .  
It placed on record their deep conviction with regard to sustainable development ; it set forth precise guidelines on regional integration and trade ; it expressed a firm resolve to press ahead in the fight against drugs and related crimes ; it emphasized , in particular , the importance of the Inter-American Convention against Corruption ; and it reiterated emphatically the crucial importance Governments , from their position of lofty responsibility , attached to cultural integration .  
With the aim of laying the groundwork for a hemispheric agenda for sustainable development , several international meetings , starting with the Summit held in Miami in 1994 , have expressed support for the decision to hold a hemispheric meeting at the level of Heads of State and Government in the Bolivian city of Santa Cruz de la Sierra , scheduled for 7 and 8 December of this year .  
That meeting will be a new opportunity to set the course of national and international endeavours for sustainable development in the light of economic , social and environmental goals and in reaffirmation of the importance of obtaining new and additional resources to finance the plan of action to be adopted .  
Nevertheless , in the current context of increasing interdependence among States , international cooperation , especially the flow of capital and technology transfer from the developed to the developing countries is indispensable , and it is also necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of the developed countries themselves .  
In this connection , I wish to hail the World Solar Summit , held on 16 and 17 September 1996 in Harare , which helped to focus world political attention on the urgent and imperative need to provide reliable , sustainable and clean sources of energy to all the people of the world , including to the 400-million homes and the 2.4-billion people in the developing world who currently have no access to electricity .  
As expected , the series of global conferences held recently under the auspices of the United Nations , which involved not only Governments but also non-governmental organizations , civil society , the media and the private sector , have raised awareness of and built consensus around a number of overarching issues concerning economic growth and sustainable development .  
The series of United Nations global conferences signifies the international community 's preoccupation with the preservation of international peace and security , the promotion and preservation of human rights and fundamental freedoms , the propagation of development techniques and the attainment of sustainable development , the provision of adequate shelter for our rapidly growing population and , indeed , the attempt to ensure the social and economic well-being of all peoples all over the world .  
The Government , in partnership with other sectors of society , is playing a multiple role in improving living and working conditions on an equitable basis to enable all its citizens to enjoy adequate shelter , affordable basic services and sustainable human settlements .  
I am confident that the United Nations will continue to do its best to act as a catalyst in the achievement of peaceful coexistence among States , and to reinforce the notion of the interdependence of national aspirations and the common welfare of humanity , thus creating conditions conducive to the political stability and sustainable economic development of States .  
The goals of sustained economic growth , social development , environmental protection and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms set in the plans of action of several international conferences have sustainable development as their common denominator .  
In the context of collective international efforts towards the achievement of some kind of sustainable development in the less developed countries , it is instructive to refer to the recently held Group of Seven summit in Lyon , France , where most of the efforts focused on the new global order .  
Looking at current economic , social and political conditions on our continent , including the atrocities meted out to our own kith and kin , one is inclined to lose hope in the ability of Africa to achieve sustainable development .  
The establishment of the three inter-agency task forces on basic social services , employment and sustainable livelihoods and the enabling environment for economic and social development has proved to be instrumental in providing United Nations system-wide support and assistance , through Resident Coordinators , to national Governments in implementing the Summit goals .  
In conclusion , I wish to express my delegation 's sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Social Summit will help to generate renewed political will at the national and international levels to attain the objectives of sustainable human development .  
Rural development and prosperity-decentralization in the region have been expedited by building up economic and social basic services to catalyse sustainable rural development and by expanding the quality and quantity of basic services to meet the local demands of the country .  
Enhanced international technical assistance and advisory services can decisively strengthen national capacities and the institutional bases for supporting national plans and strategies that are designed to bring about sustained and sustainable social development .  
In its review of Agenda 21 the special session should lay the grounds for further international cooperation , national and regional initiative , and the mobilization of resources for meeting the sustainable development needs of small island developing States .  
Consistent with agreements reached at the regional level , Papua New Guinea has adopted a comprehensive code of logging practice designed to promote the sustainable use and in-country processing of a rich renewable natural resource .  
The outstanding features of this new model have been embodied in the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , which is a national and regional strategy to foster a change in personal and social attitudes to ensure the establishment of a model of sustainable development in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental fields .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa , adopted by the General Assembly in 1991 , was a good initiative aimed at giving the international community the opportunity to review the deteriorating economic and social conditions on the African continent with a view to finding the proper solutions for them and to renewing the commitment to support Africa 's efforts to achieve continued economic growth and sustainable development .  
The United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) has focused on realizing sustainable growth and accelerating progress in agricultural development , food security , human resources development , rural and urban development , the establishment and maintenance of infrastructures , the creation of the appropriate social environment , and the enhancement of regional economic cooperation .  
With its unique approach , the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s was aimed at renewing the commitment of African countries and the international community to an agenda for the sustainable social and economic development of Africa in a spirit of global partnership based on shared responsibilities .  
If we agree that long-term , sustained growth and sustainable development depend on the private sector and on attracting foreign direct investment , then we must identify a true incentive for investment , since Africa , despite its conducive climate , is still unable to attract foreign direct investment .  
Only a few weeks ago , the mid-term review of the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s ( UN-NADAF ) allowed us to measure the remarkable progress achieved by African countries at the political , economic and social levels to create and strengthen the conditions necessary for sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the continent .  
In order to achieve the major objectives of the New Agenda and the target growth rate of 6 per cent , the international community must accelerate its support to African countries in order to sustain the momentum leading to recovery and sustainable development in areas such as the further alleviation of the burden of external debt , the attraction of foreign private investment , increased official development assistance , trade facilitation and market access , and development assistance for capacity-building .  
As our Minister for Foreign Affairs , His Excellency Mr . Nguyen Manh Cam , stressed in his address to the General Assembly in the general debate , international cooperation and in particular capital flows and technological transfers from developed countries to underdeveloped countries are indispensable and indeed are necessary and beneficial for the sustainable development of underdeveloped countries .  
We have developed , in close cooperation with the countries of the Caribbean region , a strategy based on three main priorities : support for the process of economic transition ; promotion of sustainable development of the Caribbean region with particular emphasis on human resource development , the protection of natural resources and combating socio-economic threats , including the fight against drugs ; and the promotion of increased economic cooperation leading to fuller integration in the world market .  
We have respectfully included the question of democracy in this debate because we do not think that any sustainable economic recovery is viable without a pluralistic and representative institutional framework or clear respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  The incremental measures contained in the Helms-Burton Act do not contribute to democratic transition in Cuba , nor do they make any real contribution to opening up the economy .  
That is , there should be systems of government with checks and balances , which guarantee the free exercise of the civil , political , social and cultural rights of the people , and which enhance the development of a free and dynamic society the only way to ensure harmonious and sustainable development .  
We have studied the report of the Secretary-General contained in document A / 51 / 338 and share his positive view that for the first time in three decades the region is free from armed conflict , giving rise to institutional reforms that can make it possible for there to be new social and economic reform leading to sustainable development helped by support from the international community .  
We propose that at its scheduled December 1996 meeting , the Quadripartite Committee for Coordination on Chernobyl specify the phases and modalities for advancing medical and environmental projects and programmes in order to ensure the sustainable economic and social development of Belarus and other most severely affected countries in transition , which find themselves in a critical situation as a result of the Chernobyl disaster .  
From the plundering of the oceans , the common heritage of mankind , by unsustainable fishing to the destruction of forests , the poisoning of air and water in disregard for environmental sustainability ; the destruction of communities , marginalization of whole segments of societies and eventually , civil unrest attributable to social unsustainability ; the world has seen the importance of pursuing sustainable development , whether in developed or developing countries or the economies in transition .  
There may be no other single individual who has been as instrumental or as effective in leading the world community in recent years in the difficult search for common ground , particularly on issues relating to environmentally sustainable development .  
In this sea of change in international relations , the whole concept of international security has increasingly moved away from the bipolar view , concerned largely with military security , to one which assigns a central role to sustainable development and the welfare of the individual .  
Decides that the basic problem of improving the capacity of developing countries and economies in transition to capture the maximum sustainable economic and social benefits of their potential for mineral production should be the principal focus of its inter-sessional activities and of the agenda of its fourth session , and requests the Secretary-General to prepare a discussion paper on this topic , with the assistance of members of the Committee .  
Emphasizes the need to implement sound and stable macroeconomic , micro-economic and sectoral policies that encourage broad-based economic growth and development that is sustainable and equitable , that generate jobs and that are geared towards eradicating poverty and reducing social and economic inequalities and exclusion ;  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
Most of the efforts are directed towards the strengthening of operational capability of existing regional or national institutions involved in environmental management for sustainable development , natural resource monitoring or land-cover mapping .  
In response to the Working Group of the Whole of the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , the Office for Outer Space Affairs has prepared or will prepare studies with the following titles : " Space applications for sustainable development " ; " Developing tele-education programmes through international cooperation " ; " Microsatellites and small satellites : current projects and future perspectives for international cooperation " ; and " Global exchange of scientific and technical information : networking possibilities for developing countries " .  
Themes found in both the guidelines and the common advocacy statement include putting people first ; promoting sustainable human development ; reducing gender inequality and inequity ; fostering accountability and transparency ; developing common indicators that are critical to the monitoring of programme impact ; strengthening country-level collaboration ; enhancing national capacity-building ; and facilitating dialogue between and among the United Nations resident coordinator system , Governments , non-governmental organizations , the private sector and civil society . 
Energy is a critical factor in sustainable economic and social progress and development and , this being the case , developing countries are concerned about having secure and affordable sources of energy .  
Recognizing that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged , and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life , in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them , thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development ,  
Also recognizing that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people , and that equitable social development , which empowers people living in poverty to utilize environmental resources sustainably , is a necessary foundation for sustainable development ,  
She reaffirmed that the United States understood the term " sustained economic growth " as referring to " growth in the context of sustainable development " , consistent with paragraph 6 of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development , which read as follows : " We are convinced that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people .  
It established the principles of common but differentiated responsibilities of industrialized and developing countries in achieving sustainable development and made clear the responsibility of the developed countries for examining and changing their own consumption and production levels . 
The information base will be organized to identify key objectives of sustainable consumption and production and to report on broad strategies adopted to achieve them , specific characteristics and implementation challenges presented by different economic sectors and the policies and actions adopted by Governments and other major actors to address them .  
The Commission may wish to note the important role that has been played by the existing guidelines in influencing the development of national consumer legislation and to endorse the potential of the current revision process for promoting the principles of sustainable consumption at the national level and in fostering consumer understanding of the issues .  
Reaffirming the results , as agreed , of all major United Nations conferences and summits held since the beginning of the 1990s on development , relating to effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , as well as the consideration of appropriate measures relating to the mobilization of substantial , new and additional resources to enable developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Emphasizes the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Further stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Welcoming the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations at the Ministerial Meeting of the Trade Negotiations Committee , held at Marrakesh , Morocco , from 12 to 15 April 1994 , and noting that the Uruguay Round agreements [ 8 ] / represent a historic achievement , which is expected to contribute to strengthening the world economy and to lead to more trade , investment , employment and income growth throughout the world and in particular to the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , especially in the developing countries ,  
Stresses the urgent need to continue trade liberalization , including liberalization through a substantial reduction of tariff and other barriers to trade , in particular non-tariff barriers , and the elimination of discriminatory and protectionist practices in international trade relations , and to improve access to the markets of all countries , in particular those of the developed countries , so as to generate sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to provide Nicaragua , at the request of its Government , with all possible assistance to support the consolidation of peace , democracy and sustainable development in such areas as caring for displaced persons , land ownership and land tenure in rural areas , appropriate care for war-disabled persons , mine clearance and the overcoming of difficulties in the restoration of the productive areas of the country , and , in general , a process of sustained economic and social recovery and development so that the peace and democracy already achieved become irreversible ;  
Resolutions of those organs have drawn the attention of Governments , the United Nations system and the general public to those problems and have called for action with regard to extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law as major obstacles to human rights .  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments which request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ; 
Politicians must be involved in its formulation ; politically compelling arguments for forest conservation and sustainable forestry development must be found ; and a critical mass of well-informed and motivated key decision makers committed to the plan or programme must be created .  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , 2 / in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
An ever-increasing awareness that the ocean is a basic governing force for life on this planet , particularly for small island countries , and that better understanding of its physical and biological mechanisms , including their interaction with atmospheric processes , is essential to decision-making aiming at sustainable development ; 
Chapter 17 of Agenda 21 called for governmental action , with the assistance of the specialized agencies of the United Nations system when required and with the active participation of the people and sectors involved and that of the non-governmental organizations , in order to : ( a ) improve the use and conservation of coastal resources through integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ( programme area A ) ; ( b ) increase marine environmental protection from land-based and sea-based sources of pollution  
A number of other actions can be noted , such as the 1993-1994 ban on the dumping of radioactive waste , sewage sludge and industrial waste and on incineration of toxic wastes at sea , as agreed in the 1972 Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter ( London Convention ) ; ( c ) In relation to programme areas C and D , the legal framework for sustainable use and conservation of living aquatic resources in the oceans has been substantially improved since UNCED .  
Stressing the importance of the agreed international legislative and guiding frameworks for harmonious and sustainable development of the oceans , urge Governments to ( i ) ratify , as soon as possible , the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ; ( ii ) sign and ratify the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and , in the meantime , apply the Agreement provisionally ;  
Recognizing further the progress made during the post-UNCED process in developing international and regional standards and action plans relevant to the protection and management of coastal and marine environments and to the sustainable use and conservation of its resources , recommend that Governments : ( i ) continue to use existing mechanisms and forums to foster further progress ; ( ii ) actively participate in regional action plans , programmes and other cooperative arrangements ; and ( iii ) take advantage of international collaboration , particularly in the area of financing ;  
The objective of programme element I . 3 is to make proposals that will encourage countries - in a manner consistent with the provisions of the Convention on Biological Diversity - to consider ways and means whereby the traditional forest-related knowledge , innovations and practices of forest-dwellers and indigenous and local communities can be effectively protected with a view to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , and the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices can be shared fairly and equitably . 
The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses specifically the need to respect , preserve and maintain the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , as well as the need to protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices .  
The Convention on Biological Diversity addresses specifically the need to respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity , as well as the need to protect and encourage customary use of biological resources in accordance with traditional cultural practices .  
Such efforts can contribute to improving the linkage of rural settlements with the mainstream of economic , social and cultural life , to assuring sustainable communities and safe environments , and to reducing pressures on urban growth .  
Although many countries , particularly developing countries , lack legal , institutional , financial , technological and human resources to respond adequately to rapid urbanization , many local authorities are taking on these challenges with open , accountable and effective leadership and are eager to bring people into the sustainable development process .  
It offers , within a framework of goals and principles and commitments , a positive vision of sustainable human settlements - where all have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services , and productive and freely chosen employment .  
One of the purposes of the Central American Integration System , as set forth in the Tegucigalpa Protocol , is to attain the sustainable development of Central America , which presupposes defining a new , unique , comprehensive and indivisible regional security model inspired by the region 's achievements during its intensive process of pacification and integration ;  
A solution to the problems of personal security in the region will thus require a comprehensive and interrelated view of all aspects of sustainable development in Central America in its political , economic , social , cultural and ecological dimensions ;  
There is a sense of great opportunity and hope that a new world can be built in which economic development , social development and environmental protection as interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development can be realized through solidarity and cooperation within and between countries , and through effective partnerships at all levels .  
The empowerment of women and their full and equal participation in political , social and economic life , the improvement of health , and the alleviation of poverty are essential to achieving sustainable human settlements .  Paragraphs 10 and 10 bis should be joined as a single paragraph .  
[ Civil , ethnic and religious strife , nuclear armament , armed conflicts , alien and colonial domination , foreign occupation , international economic imbalance , coercive economic measures , poverty , organized crime , and terrorism in all its forms are destructive to sustainable human settlements development and should therefore be renounced by all States . ]  
The principle of poverty eradication is based on the framework adopted by the World Summit for Social Development and on the relevant outcomes of other major United Nations conferences , including the objective of meeting the basic needs of all people , especially those living in poverty , disadvantaged and vulnerable groups , particularly in the developing countries where poverty is acute , as well as the objective of enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work .  NULL  
Partnerships among countries and among all actors within countries from public , private , voluntary , and community-based organizations , the cooperative sector , non-governmental organizations , and individuals are essential to the achievement of sustainable human settlements development and the provision of adequate shelter for all and basic services .  
Consistent with local needs and conditions , such efforts should include improving human settlements management , encouraging the sustainable development of intermediate cities that create employment opportunities for unemployed rural labour , and providing environmental infrastructure .  
Depending on the context and needs of the cities , towns and villages in each country and region , special attention should be paid to the most critical issues , such as changing production and consumption patterns ; energy efficiency ; sustainable resource and land-use management ; [ poverty eradication ; population and health ; water supply , sanitation and waste management ; disaster prevention , mitigation , preparedness and management ; cultural and historical heritage ; environmental protection ; industry ; infrastructure ; and basic services such as health and education facilities .  
The eradication of poverty requires , inter alia , sound macroeconomic policies aimed at creating employment opportunities , equal and universal access to economic opportunities ( and special efforts to facilitate such access for the disadvantaged ) ; education and training that will promote sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen productive employment and work , and basic social services , including health facilities . 
An integrated approach to the provision of environmentally sound infrastructure in human settlements , particularly for the rural and urban poor , is an investment in sustainable human settlements development that can enhance the quality of life , reduce negative impacts on the environment , improve the overall health of a population , and reduce the burden of investment in curative health and poverty alleviation . 95 bis .  
Indeed , it has been pointed out that a major cause of the failure of sustainable forest management , and even of deforestation and transfer of forests to other land uses , is the inadequate recognition and underestimation of the values of the many goods and services provided by forests at the local , the national , the regional and global the level .  
This approach provides the necessary base for moving towards sustainable land-use systems within which forests are clearly recognized as an option with its own validity in contributing to sustainability at local , national and global levels . 
The United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and the secretariats of the regional commissions , as well as the principal financial and technical institutions and all other partners at the regional and global levels , should consolidate and expand cooperation and coordination in the fields of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
The World Health Organization should be guided in the implementation of the Habitat Agenda by the global importance of health issues , the linkage of those issues to sustainable human settlements and adequate shelter , the close relationship between public health and basic urban and rural services , and the need to place human beings at the centre of development .  
We commit ourselves to the goal of improving living and working conditions on an equitable and sustainable basis , so that everyone will have adequate shelter that is healthy , safe , secure , accessible , and affordable and that includes basic services , facilities and amenities and the enjoyment of freedom from discrimination in housing and legal security of tenure .  
We commit ourselves to the goal of sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world by developing economies that will make efficient use of resources within the carrying capacity of ecosystems and by providing all people with equal opportunities for a healthy , safe and productive life in harmony with nature and their cultural heritage and spiritual and cultural values , thereby ensuring social progress .  
Stimulating national and local economies , through enabling competitive and sustainable economic development that will attract public and international financial resources and private investments , generate employment and increase revenues , providing a stronger financial base to support shelter and human settlements development ;  
The international community , including multilateral financial institutions , has an important role to play in providing additional resources to reinforce national efforts to foster an enabling environment so as to achieve the objectives of adequate shelter for all and the sustainable development of human settlements .  
The coordination of macroeconomic policies at all levels so as to achieve an international financial system that is conducive to stable and sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , and bilateral - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support sustainable human settlements development .  
Raising the priority of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development among multilateral and bilateral donors and mobilizing their support for national , subregional and regional plans of action of developing countries , especially for interested beneficiary countries ;  
Encouraging multilateral development institutions and donors to support nations in their effort to pursue enabling strategies through which national and local governments , communities and the private and cooperative sectors can form partnerships to participate in shelter and sustainable human settlements development activities ;  
Inviting multilateral and bilateral donors to support countries , particularly developing countries , in their efforts to pursue enabling strategies through which governments , local authorities , communities , and the private and cooperative sectors can form partnerships to participate in the provision of adequate shelter , including social housing and sustainable human settlements development activities ;  
Striving to enhance the effectiveness of existing official development assistance and other external financial flows through improving coordination between and among donors and the United Nations operational activities , and through better coherence between those flows and internal sustainable human settlements strategies ;  
Developing economic policies to promote and mobilize domestic savings and attract external resources for productive investments , and seeking innovative sources of funding , both public and private , for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements development programmes , while ensuring effective utilization of those resources ;  
Assisting countries , particularly developing countries , in implementing effective and equitable pricing mechanisms for adequate shelter and sustainable human settlements , infrastructure and services in order to induce greater flows of private , domestic and global funds , while ensuring transparent and targeted subsidies for people living in poverty ;  
The task of pursuing the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , in the face of increasing global economic interaction , necessitates international cooperation of public and private institutions operating in the areas of human settlement development , whereby resources , information and capacities are pooled for a more effective response to human settlements problems . 156 bis .  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reiterating the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , and the sustainable use of its components , as well as the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources ,  
Welcomes , in pursuance of its resolution 49 / 22 A , the restructuring of the Special High-Level Council and the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Decade so that for the second half of the Decade they will provide the necessary support to global , regional and national policy and strategy development , public awareness-building and resource mobilization , and at the same time provide links with the scientific community and support the national committees for the Decade and national authorities in their cooperative efforts to integrate disaster reduction programmes into national activities for sustainable development ;  
Reaffirming that sustained economic growth and sustainable development are essential for the prevention of and preparedness for natural disasters and similar disasters with an adverse impact on the environment and that special attention should be given to disaster prevention and preparedness by the Governments concerned as well as by the international community ,  
The most important challenges to continuous and sustainable development that humanity will face in the near future will be the provision of basic necessities , such as food , shelter , a clean and healthy environment and proper education , to the growing population of Earth .  
Because industrial and agricultural activities on the Earth 's environment have reached such a level that their effects are clearly observed on a global scale , continuous and sustainable development action and policies should be carried out for the protection and maintenance of Earth 's natural environment .  
In their observations and recommendations , which are presented below , the participants identified current situations and indicated the policies and action that should be supported by governments , national and international institutions and the scientific and technical communities to foster favourable conditions for the use of space technology in support of sustainable development .  
According to some scenarios , sustainable biomass energy has the potential to become the largest single source of energy globally , providing from 17 per cent to 35 per cent of the total demand for primary energy in 2050 if sustainability policies are adopted and technological advances achieved in the production of liquid , solid and gaseous fuels from biomass , based on the use of fast-growing species , soil-water species relationships , new harvesting and conversion techniques or the application of genetically engineered bacteria .  
In future , apart from expanding the resource base and developing major technological breakthroughs , the main challenge facing the world will be the necessity of examining lifestyles in all regions with the objective of matching supply and demand for energy in a stable and sustainable manner and implementing programmes to promote sustainability .  
In general terms , sustainable forest management deals with the administrative , economic , social , legal , technical and scientific aspects of the conservation and sustainable use of forests within the framework of technically sound and politically accepted national land-use plans . 
In operational terms , sustainable forest management includes the formulation and implementation of forest management plans , which help to control and regulate harvesting of specified goods , combined with silvicultural and protective measures applied in varying intensity to sustain or to enhance the social , ecological and economic value of subsequent generations of the managed forests .  
Environmentally sustainable forest management recognizes that forests simultaneously provide a wide range of socio-economic , environmental and cultural benefits , values and services at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
The step-wise approach used in many of the ongoing initiatives in the development of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , includes early dialogue and regular reviews and refinement at technical and scientific level , complemented by subsequent policy level discussions and endorsement of principles developed .  
In these forums , special reference has been made to the need to expand activities to cover all kinds of forests , with a view to arriving at a complete global coverage of clearly defined criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management , applicable to countries in all geographic and ecological regions of the world .  
As stressed above , criteria and indicators defined at the national level are aimed at improving the quantity and quality of information available to decision makers and the general public about progress towards sustainable forest management , and thus to assist in the policy and decision-making process ; the ultimate aim in this regard is to further improve forest management practices over time .  
Research and methodologies to quantify indicators presently recorded as qualitative and descriptive ; and encouragement of objective monitoring of related national trends over time ; ( e ) Possibilities of forging closer links between action related to the ITTO " Target 2000 " with other ongoing international initiatives aimed at the definition of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management ;  
At its first session , the Panel re-emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms , as mutually agreed , and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
Fiscal regimes applied to natural resources have a long way to go in discouraging the excessive extraction and harvesting of natural resources and / or mobilizing substantial additional budgetary resources for sustainable development .  
Reaffirms that such a dialogue should be conducted in response to the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development as well as improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development , and that the United Nations should reinforce its activities in order to facilitate such a dialogue ;  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
Acknowledges that the administration of justice , including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and , especially , an independent judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in international human rights instruments , are essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable to democratization processes and sustainable development ;  
The Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Secretariat organized a meeting of the Expert Group on the Identification of Principles of International Law for Sustainable Development , within the framework established by the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development 5 / and Agenda 21 , to identify basic principles of international law for sustainable development , consider possible classifications of such principles , and assess their potential practical implications in a legal context , including their role in the interpretation and application of existing international law in the field .  
This is important for a number of reasons already specified , among which may be highlighted the need to advance understanding of what sustainable development means in relationship to international law and the importance of certain " benchmark principles " for guiding the drafting of national legislation , the interpretation of existing law and negotiations of future international law . 
The rapid growth in environmental regulation during the late 1980s and early 1990s , together with growing demands from customers , has encouraged business and industry to examine a range of strategies and techniques for moving towards more sustainable production and consumption .  
Calls upon all Governments , international and multilateral organizations , financial institutions and development funds , the organs , organizations and programmes of the United Nations system , and all other organizations concerned to take immediate , concrete and adequate steps to implement the Programme of Action , taking full account of the measures and recommendations of the mid-term global review so as to ensure sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the least developed countries and to enable them to participate in and benefit from the process of globalization and liberalization ;  
They reaffirmed their commitment to work cooperatively towards achieving the prime objective of the Programme of Action which is to arrest the further deterioration in the socio-economic situation of the least developed countries , to reactivate and accelerate growth and development in these countries and , in the process , to set them on the path of economic growth and sustainable development based on shared responsibility and strengthened partnership .  
Redraft the beginning of paragraph 8.3 as follows : " The main objectives of the Department will be the promotion of an integrated approach to economic , social and environmental aspects of development , including the elaboration of perspectives that will provide for sustainable , equitable and participatory development .  
Recalling that the prime objective of the New Agenda is to stop and reverse the continuing deterioration in the socio-economic situation of African countries and to renew the commitment of the international community to support Africa 's own efforts to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
The report drew from the deliberations of an Expert Group meeting of legal experts convened by the Division for Sustainable Development in the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Secretariat , in its capacity as task manager for chapter 39 , pursuant to the following objectives : to identify basic principles of international law for sustainable development , to consider possible classifications of such principles , and to assess their potential practical implications in a legal context , including their role in the interpretation and application of existing international law in the field . 
This effectiveness may be measured by a number of different factors , including the development of new instruments , mechanisms and standards so as to respond to need , as it arises ; the effective integration of environmental and developmental issues ; implementation , monitoring and compliance ; the participation of developing countries in negotiation , implementation , review and governance ; financial and technical assistance to developing countries ; dispute avoidance and settlement ; coordination and consistency among international legal instruments ; and the identification of new and emerging issues in the field of sustainable development .  
Chapter 39 calls for the provision to developing countries of technical assistance for the purpose of enhancing their national legislative capabilities in the field of environmental law ; it also states ( para . that technical and financial support should include assistance in building up expertise in international law particularly in relation to sustainable development .  
The Workshop was composed of qualified academic and governmental lawyers in their personal capacities , taking into account geographical representation ; and was based on the premise that , in moving towards sustainable development , international environmental law is inspiring new and innovative concepts , principles and ideas , and developing facilitative and enabling mechanisms and procedures in areas such as implementation and compliance and dispute avoidance and settlement .  
Capacity-development , like sustainable development , encompasses a wide range of aspects , including the human , technological , organizational , financial , scientific , cultural and institutional .  
A milestone in supporting the indigenous groups came with the release of the UNDP-sponsored study Conserving Indigenous Knowledge : Integrating Two Systems of Innovation . 2 / Coming to a workable consensus on respective roles and achieving productive partnership arrangements among these major groups remain two of the enduring challenges of capacity-building for sustainable development . 
The shift in emphasis from planning to strategy implementation of sustainable development has led practitioners to confront familiar institutional constraints - highly compartmentalized organizations in the public sector , difficulties in promoting more decentralization , the continuation of sectoral thinking and acting , lack of sufficient accountability and responsiveness , a shortage of financial and skilled human resources , poor salary and working conditions , and a lack of a performance culture in many development organizations .  
In this programme the United Nations University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa ( UNU / INRA ) addresses the continent 's urgent needs for human resources development and institutional capacity-building in order to achieve more effective conservation , management and rational utilization of natural resources for sustainable development .  
This programme consists of a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacities in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life .  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems ( including a new series on critical environmental regions ) .  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America ;  
Requests the Government of Burundi to continue its efforts geared towards the achievement of national reconciliation and the maintenance of lasting peace , inter alia , through adherence to the principles of the Convention on Governance , provisions that are essential for the successful and sustainable implementation of humanitarian aid and economic , financial , material and technical assistance to the people of Burundi ;  
Acting on the recommendation of the Tangier Declaration , the General Assembly adopted resolution 49 / 136 on public administration and development , in which it recognized the important role that Governments and public administrations can play in addressing new responsibilities arising from the pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , and also recognized the need for strengthened public administrative and financial management capacities in order to ensure a civil service that is responsive to the needs of the people .  
During the 1990s , dramatic political and economic shifts had been occurring throughout the world , marked by increasing tendencies towards democratization , greater reliance on market forces , greater emphasis on mobilizing domestic resources and reducing fiscal deficits , increasing privatization , growing participation of non-governmental and community-based organizations in development processes , and heightened recognition of the need to assure environmentally sound and sustainable development .  
Public administration will continue to fulfil critical functions in development , supporting measures for economic growth , protecting the environment , determining the relationship between the public and the private sector , reducing poverty and illiteracy and other social development activities , thereby achieving the goals of sustainable development .  
Commends the efforts of the Institute to address all levels of poverty that hamper so dramatically the advancement of women , through the coordination of research and training activities in the areas of economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; communications ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , sanitation and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different population groups , such as the girl child , older women , displaced women , refugee and migrant women and women in rural areas ;  
In spite of some encouraging individual examples of the growth of official development assistance ( ODA ) , as well as of some promising approaches towards mobilizing domestic and international resources for sustainable development identified and explored by the Commission through its Ad Hoc Inter-sessional Working Group on Finance , the overall picture in regard to the implementation of all the recommendations and commitments related to finance as contained in Agenda 21 remains an area of concern .  
Cooperation with the Division was included in the programme of action of the Agence for the years 1996 to 2000 with the objective , on a global level , of furthering democratic governance and sustainable development under the rule of law by the promotion of an independent , accessible and efficient judiciary .  
The multidisciplinary mission team consisted of 10 members and included a development economist , a mineral resources expert , an industrial economist , an environmental lawyer , a sustainable agriculture analyst , a fisheries adviser , a natural resources adviser , an institutional adviser , an education adviser and a people 's participation adviser .  
Using the vision of sustainable human development contained in the Five Goals of the National Constitution as the framework for its work , the mission analysed the major environment and development issues facing Papua New Guinea under the three broad headings of enabling government , managing Papua New Guinea 's resources and empowering people for effective participation and integral human development .  
In Viet Nam , a technical cooperation project was recently completed that assisted the Government in completing a new mining law , together with the implementation of regulations and a model mining agreement , and in establishing an administrative framework for the effective operation of the new legislation and the sustainable development of the mining sector .  
Directly tied into this process has been the continued dissemination of individual country information through the very successful investment seminars and round-table discussions which have enabled private companies , financial institutions and technical advisers to gain a better understanding of various countries and their risk factors , and to develop good working relationships with private and government officials and the multilateral and bilateral aid institutions , all with a view towards creating a sustainable economic and environmentally sound base of operations on which to build within the various countries .  
The host Government 's role should include the strengthening of social institutions to increase social equity ; achieving sustainable economic growth including extracting an appropriate " economic rent " through fiscal policy and / or direct royalty at the operational level ; and achieving environmental sustainability .  
The emphasis on artisanal mining is consistent with the objectives of the main international development funding organizations , such as the World Bank objective , stated at the round table , to alleviate poverty and improve living standards through sustainable growth and investment in people , and the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) objectives of poverty alleviation , environmental protection , job creation and promotion of the advancement of women .  
Cooperation with the Division was included in the programme of action of the Organization for the years 1996 to 2000 with the objective , on a global level , of furthering democratic governance and sustainable development under the rule of law through the promotion of an independent , accessible and efficient judiciary .  
These policy options will endeavour to link land and water management issues ; water for food security ; and safe drinking water supply , sanitation and sewerage and human health in the context of economic and social development .  NULLThe report will be supplemented by commissioned studies on the economic aspects of sustainable water resources development and use and gender issues , as well as a study on the relationship between water resources and growing urbanization and a study on cooperative approaches to the development of shared river basins .  
Invite UNCTAD and UNEP jointly , in cooperation with the secretariats of relevant MEAs , and taking into account the discussions by the Commission at its fourth session , to initiate an intergovernmental process aimed at developing comprehensive non-binding guidelines ( i.e . , incorporating legal , economic and development considerations ) to assist MEA negotiators in their consideration of the possible future use of trade and other measures in MEAs , with a view to promoting sustainable development as well as compatibility between trade and environmental policies .  
There were also concerns , however , that the new technologies would lead to growing social and economic gaps and injustice , and would threaten cultural diversity , religious values and even individual freedom ; there was therefore a need to study ways to make the new technologies widely accessible and supportive of sustainable development .  
Establish , fund and coordinate a sustainable network of accessible facilities and services for emergency and temporary residential accommodation for women and children , for example , " one-stop centres " , where all necessary assistance and services could be made available , including health care , crisis intervention , support , referral and counselling , in matters relating to the lodging of and follow-up to formal complaints , legal aid and court witness assistance , as well as personal protection , child care and earning a livelihood ;  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace of global economic developments and their implications for all countries , particularly developing countries , and the critical importance of efficient and effective government institutions , administrative systems and procedures , and sound financial management to harness these changes in support of economic and social progress and sustainable development ,  
Recognizing the need for effective government and efficient public administrative services to be responsive to the needs of the people , to ensure universal access to quality services and productive assets and to create an enabling environment for sustainable development and provide quality services ,  
Reaffirming the importance of promoting cooperation among all countries in enhancing the quality of public administration , including , inter alia , the promotion of a participatory approach to development , the provision of basic social services , the development of policies to eradicate poverty and the establishment of an enabling environment for economic growth , social justice and sustainable development ,  
Stressing the importance of an efficient and effective public sector as the basic framework for stable and sustainable institutional and human development in all countries ,  
Invites the international community to recognize the importance of the role of public administration and governance in sustainable human development and the maintenance of peace and stability , and to provide adequate resources for programmes of assistance for improving public administration in developing countries , countries with economies in transition and countries facing special circumstances ;  
Furthermore , Governments should , where feasible , promote the development of sustainable aquaculture as a means to increase food production and improve the economic basis for local community development , taking into account : ( a ) the need for assistance and transfer of technology and know-how to developing countries ; ( b ) the potential adverse impacts on the environment ; ( c ) the risks of introducing alien species ; and ( d ) the need for improved knowledge in the use of genetic engineering .  
The Working Group felt that the special session of the General Assembly to be held in June 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 could provide recommendations on the future role that the Commission should play as the focal point for formulating the consensus of States on strategies and priorities for action needed at the global level to promote the sustainable development and conservation of the marine environment . 
Stressing the importance of promoting regional and international cooperation for the development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ,  
Among the lessons learned are that the promotion of productive employment constitutes a key strategy for sustainable poverty alleviation ; organization in groups allows poor women to mobilize human , financial and material resources ; issues such as access to credit and to other productive resources are essential for breaking out of poverty ; adequate social insurance and social security coverage of vulnerable groups - such as workers in the urban informal and rural sectors - are necessary ;  
Document good practices , innovative models and success stories with respect to assisting women in improving their living and working environment , to the adoption of sound environmental technologies and to women 's role in maintaining sustainable urban environments under conditions of globalization and rapid urbanization , and propose ways of assisting them in that role ( UNIFEM , UNEP / UNCHS , World Bank , UNDP , UNESCO , DPCSD ) .  
The objective of the initiative undertaken by the Netherlands and Switzerland is to facilitate dialogue and exchange experiences regarding national needs assessment as a supporting tool for the improved utilization of environmentally sound technologies in the transition towards sustainable development , in particular in developing countries and in countries in economic transition .  17 / 1996 / 1 .  
Bearing in mind the rapid pace and interdependence of global , political , social and economic developments , and their implications for all countries , particularly the developing countries , and that there is a critical need for improved efficiency and effective public institutions , administrative procedures and sound financial management to harness these challenges in support of sustainable development in all countries ,  
Recognizing that effectiveness of government requires an efficient and effective public administration in all countries that is responsive to the needs of the people , promotes social justice , ensures universal access to quality services and productive assets and creates an enabling environment for sustainable people-centred development ,  
Most ESCWA member countries have developed , or are developing , strategies or plans to combat environmental degradation and achieve sustainable development .  However , financial constraints and reduced public expenditure are apparently hindering the implementation of such strategies and plans .  
Both sides believe that it is necessary for the United Nations to formulate an Agenda for Development based on General Assembly resolutions and hope that the conclusion and adoption of the Agenda for Development will help the international community achieve the objective of sustainable development , contribute to the economic growth and social development of the developing countries and promote international cooperation and global development .  
Thus , within the new priorities related to sustainable urbanization and the environment , freshly mandated reports by decisions taken by the Commission on Human Settlements at its fourteenth session , were produced under subprogrammes related to global issues and strategies and the construction sector .  The above included reports on population , urbanization and quality of life ; strengthening of regional activities ; urban and housing indicators ; building materials and health ; and human settlements and environmental strategies .  
The overall objective of programme 3 , Outer space affairs , is to promote international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space by assisting and collaborating with Member States , in particular developing countries , organizations within the United Nations system , national and international space-related organizations and the private sector in the areas of space science and technology with emphasis on the application of space technology for sustainable development .  
To strengthen the capacity of Governments at the national and local levels as well as of the private sector to manage the rapidly growing demand for infrastructure and services in urban and rural settlements in an economically efficient and environmentally and socially sustainable manner ;  
To strengthen international cooperation in the development and implementation of human settlement policies striving towards environmental , economic and social soundness and sustainable development ; monitor and analyse results in the implementation process ; coordinate those policies with overall national sustainable development objectives ; and build institutional capacity and professional know-how ;  
To identify new and emerging trends in the ecological , economic , social , technical and legislative spheres that influence sustainable human settlements development in the ECE region ;  
While the reduction of posts was a factor in determining final output , the main consideration of the comprehensive review was to find a sustainable level of resources , taking into account the workload analysis for the period under review and bearing in mind the financial constraints faced by the Organization .  
In accordance with the " precautionary principle " , the Committee , in the draft resolution recommended for adoption by the Economic and Social Council , identified a number of concrete steps at the global level which could assist in the management of mineral resources and of environmental impacts during the period of transition to more sustainable consumption patterns .  
Noting that it is essential that strategies to move to sustainable consumption and production patterns of minerals be linked to strategies to maintain supply , and that the goal of ensuring optimal and efficient use of available resources with minimum environmental impact requires that the demand be met from the most efficient sources world wide ,  
This audience-oriented approach focuses on rural young men and women , the key players in a global programme aimed at ensuring increased agricultural production that conserves our natural resources to the greatest extent and sustainable rural development that reduces the push of rural poverty that exacerbates the current high levels of rural to urban migration in many of the developing countries .  
Strengthening international data collection and statistical systems to support countries in monitoring social development goals and encouraging the expansion of international databases to incorporate socially beneficial activities that are not included in available data , such as women 's unremunerated work and contributions to society , the informal economy and sustainable livelihoods ;  
The tasks identified by the Secretary-General included availability and management of water , sustainable food security , capacity - building for governance , social and human development and mobilization of external and internal financial resources for African development .  
The main focus of the subprogramme , which is implemented by the Department of Public Information , is to raise global awareness of Africa 's critical economic situation and of the actions taken by Africa and the international community to promote the economic recovery and sustainable development of the continent .  
We are referring to the desire of the peoples and States of the Commonwealth to make more effective use of their material and intellectual potential with a view to stimulating their economies , raising their standard of living and ensuring sustainable democratic development .  
The Board stated that the Institute 's programme of work should continue to focus on and establish priorities in areas where INSTRAW has already acquired expertise - areas such as the political and economic empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; natural resources and sustainable development ; water and waste management ; renewable sources of energy ; access to credit ; women and the media ; and , issues relating to different population groups , especially the elderly and displaced , refugees and migrant women .  
The Acting Director noted that this limited the Institute 's ability to provide the other main committees of the General Assembly with substantive contributions and conclusions derived from its research in crucial areas of economic and social development , such as water , environment and sustainable development , waste management , renewable sources of energy , human settlements , alleviation of poverty , desertification , international migration , and violence against women migrant workers .  
The overall orientation of the programme , which is under the responsibility of the Department for Development Support and Management Services , is to enhance and support , through technical cooperation , the national efforts of Member States , in particular developing countries and the least developed among them , as well as economies in transition , to build their human and institutional capabilities and infrastructures to formulate and effectively implement economic and social policies that will contribute to sustainable , people-centred development and the eradication of poverty .  
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed as well as certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
We , the Heads of State or Government and the official delegations of countries assembled at the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) in Istanbul , Turkey from 3 to 14 June 1996 , take this opportunity to endorse the universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter for all and making human settlements safer , healthier and more livable , equitable , sustainable and productive .  
Our deliberations on the two major themes of the Conference - adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world - have been inspired by the Charter of the United Nations and are aimed at reaffirming existing and forging new partnerships for action at the international , national and local levels to improve our living environment .  
Recent United Nations world conferences , including , in particular , the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , have given us a comprehensive agenda for the equitable attainment of peace , justice and democracy built on economic development , social development and environmental protection as interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
As we move into the twenty-first century , we offer a positive vision of sustainable human settlements , a sense of hope for our common future and an exhortation to join a truly worthwhile and engaging challenge , that of building together a world where everyone can live in a safe home with a promise of a decent life of dignity , good health , safety , happiness and hope .  
He also stressed that the establishment of an independent economy and sustainable economic development would necessarily require a diversified production base , free trade relations with Israel and the transformation from dependency on exporting the labour force to production and exports to foreign markets .  
The Commission also continued to study the distributive aspects of economic development , with special emphasis on analysing the effects of adjustment processes on income distribution ; public policies aimed at changing production patterns and promoting sustainable development and social equity , with an emphasis on assessing their effectiveness in those different spheres .  
In order to strengthen cooperation at the inter-agency level , ACC established in 1995-three ad hoc inter-agency task forces to provide integrated support for country-level action around three interrelated themes : ( a ) the enabling environment for social and economic development , with the World Bank serving as lead agency ; ( b ) employment and sustainable livelihoods , with the ILO as lead agency ; and ( c ) basic social services for all , with UNFPA as lead agency .  
Concerning agriculture , United Nations assistance will follow a multi-track approach aimed at strengthening the institutional capacity of the Palestinian Authority for agricultural development ; supporting sustainable natural resources management policies and practices ; revitalizing support services to agricultural entrepreneurs ; developing the sector 's human resources and encouraging the competitiveness of agricultural products ; and supporting the rehabilitation of essential rural physical infrastructures .  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environment protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , drug prevention , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , poverty eradication , and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
UNCTAD , in its field of competence and in collaboration with relevant regional and international organizations as well as non-governmental organizations , should be prepared to extend to island developing countries its technical cooperation capacity in respect of policies for sustainable economic development .  
ESCAP / POC currently has an advisory strength of nine advisers covering such diverse areas as economic and financial management , development and strategic planning , physical planning , sustainable development , social development , women in development , trade and investment , and ports and harbours development .  
To urge countries and international organizations to prepare in-depth strategic studies of forestry-specific ramifications of present consumption and production patterns in developing and developed countries , with special emphasis given to the positive and negative effects on the sustainable management and use of forests .  
In parallel with the required policy reforms for achieving sustainable forest management , the implementation of effective measures to address underlying causes of deforestation and forest degradation should be based on the results obtained from the application of a comprehensive diagnostic framework .  
This policy statement , intended as a contribution by the world 's farmers to the World Food Summit , emphasized that in order to increase food production while at the same time assuring sustainable relationships with the natural environment and maintaining stable rural societies , farmers acting through their own organizations needed to take a central role . 
Therefore , one can not find in the draft articles concepts such as water basin or integrated management . one can see sufficiently enshrined neither substantive principles such as sustainable development , precaution and preventive action nor their procedural corollaries : the requirement of environmental impact assessments , of transparency , of broadly informing and notifying the public and of consultation and negotiation on the impact of planned measures . 
In preparation for Kotka III , an attempt was made to match the information that had been collected at global level by FRA 90 and proposed for collection by FRA 2000 against the indicators of sustainable forest management identified by the ongoing international processes concerned with this subject .  
Promoting ways to expand and intensify activities in the identification of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management , especially in the regions not yet involved in ongoing initiatives , including special ways and means to assist developing countries in which forests and woodlands are essential in meeting basic subsistence needs of rural populations and forest-dwelling peoples ;  
Ensuring common measurement and assessment standards and methods worldwide is part of the framework of the preparation of FRA 2000 , and some of the parameters to be assessed are directly related to indicators of sustainable forest management at the national level identified in the four main international processes .  
National capacities , especially in developing countries , must be urgently strengthened not only to implement sustainable forest management but also to collect and compile reliable data for monitoring the sustainability of forest management at the national level and to ensure that the information generated is relevant , scientifically sound and technically valid . 
If sustainable forest management as conceptualized at the international level is to be widely implemented at the national level on a lasting basis , international solidarity in the sharing of technologies , know-how and information and in making resources available to meet common needs must receive increased attention .  
The conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources should be integrated into national forest programmes ;  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems , including a new series on critical environmental regions .  
The activities of FAO in support of the economies in transition in central and eastern Europe and CIS concentrate on support for the implementation of economic and institutional reforms undertaken since the early 1990s as they involve and affect the agricultural and rural sector and , through assistance in approaching sustainable development , on support for the integration of the agriculture of these countries into the world economy .  
" Respect , preserve and maintain knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and promote their wider application with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices and encourage the equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of such knowledge , innovations and practices " ( art . ) ;  
To urge developed countries and international organizations to support capacity-building activities for creating partnership agreements for sustainable forest management with indigenous people , forest dwellers and local communities ( including , for example , negotiation skills , understanding of the sustainable forest management agenda and outside interest in TFRK , legal support ) and mechanisms for compensating the real costs of participation ( forgone labour or social investments , as well as routine expenses ) .  
The proposed medium-term plan for the period 1998-2001 reflects the following priorities : maintenance of peace and security , promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries ; development of Africa ; promotion of human rights ; effective response to humanitarian emergencies ; and promotion of justice and international law .  
The third session of the Commission and the first session of the Panel emphasized the need to explore and consider ways to address the areas relating to the transfer and development of environmentally sound technology on favourable terms as mutually agreed and the mobilization of financial resources to assist developing countries in pursuing policies and comprehensive strategies for achieving sustainable forest management , taking into account the ongoing work of the Commission and other relevant processes .  
The basic NFP principles recognize the following key elements ( see document E / CN . 17 / IPF / 1996 / 8 ) : national sovereignty ; integration with a country 's sustainable development strategy ; partnership ; participation ; a holistic and intersectoral approach ; a long-term iterative process ; capacity-building ; policy and institutional reforms ; consistency with national policy frameworks and global initiatives ; awareness-raising ; and harmony with national and international commitments .  
NFP links together strategic and operational planning and it is specifically designed to increase effectiveness and efficiency in sustainable forestry development at the country level , potentially leading to increased commitments by potential sources of both domestic and external funds .  
Proposed measures may include strengthening existing national research institutions , encouraging national research institutions to play a more active regional role and considering the feasibility of creating new international research institutions and networks dedicated to sustainable management and utilization of forests and forest policy research .  
It is desirable for the information systems to be Internet-based for this would allow easy access and information-sharing among multilateral agencies , countries ' institutions , non-governmental organizations and other interested parties .  The Panel may wish to invite relevant multilateral forest agencies and international organizations to review and initiate the development of improved information systems that support activities for sustainable forest management , particularly so as to facilitate private sector investment , speed up technology transfer to developing countries and improve coordination in financial assistance .  
To achieve an overview of the relevance of existing international legal instruments to the conservation , management and sustainable use of all types of forests and their relation to issues on the global forest agenda , the present report provides a comprehensive summary of multilateral instruments that are relevant to forest use and conservation .  
While they have evolved a holistic , traditional scientific knowledge of their land , natural resources and environment , their ability to practise sustainable development of their lands has been limited by economic , social and historical factors .  
The Panel recognized the importance of international cooperation for the management , conservation and sustainable development of forests , particularly in developing countries , in spite of the fact that it was each country 's responsibility to develop policies that would create an enabling environment for private , bilateral and multilateral investments in the forest sector .  
At the local level ( village or community level , district level ) , sustainable development entails many aims and objectives , such as eliminating poverty and raising living standards , increasing food production , improving the quality of human settlements , halting the spread of desertification , preventing deforestation , preserving biodiversity and managing existing forests .  
The goal of a national forest programme is to ensure the conservation , management and sustainable development of forests to meet local , national , regional and global needs and requirements , by fostering national and international partnerships for the benefit of present and future generations .  
Comprehensive national forest strategies that are consistent with and integrated into macroeconomic planning and policy and take into account the strategic value of forests as a capital base for national sustainable development need to be developed in order to facilitate mobilizing funds for sustainable forest development from various sources .  
Although Africa is faced with enormous problems , it also has a great potential , both in human and natural resources , for sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
The extent to which the scarcity of tropical hardwood resources may become a constraint on processing activities , as reflected in increased real prices for tropical logs and sawnwood , will depend on the willingness of major developing country producers to pursue sustainable management of remaining old-growth production forests and coordinate processing capacity with supply .  
Since it may be easier to negotiate and implement , country certification may not only lay the groundwork for more comprehensive international forest product certification agreements but also buy time , by initiating immediate incentives for action on sustainable forest management while the details of more complicated agreements on certification for all global forest products from natural and plantation forests are concluded .  
Finally , as will be discussed below , improved information on markets and revenues is required in order to assess the additional financial assistance that may be needed by low-income producer countries if they are to adopt sustainable forest management and the most efficient and equitable international mechanism for providing that assistance .  
The Council , in paragraph 2 of the resolution , " Commends the work of the Institute on the issue addressing the process of the economic and political empowerment of women ; statistics and indicators in gender issues ; women , natural resources and sustainable development ; water , waste management and renewable sources of energy ; and issues related to different groups , such as the elderly , displaced , refugees and migrant women " .  
Hope was expressed that a solution will be found as the World Bank and IMF continue their joint and ongoing efforts to bring the external debt problems of heavily indebted poor countries , including multilateral debt , to a sustainable level .  
At the ninth session of the Conference , member States decided that the main role of UNCTAD in the field of trade in goods and services should be to help maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , particularly the least developed countries and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , into the international trading system so as to promote their development .  
In Costa Rica , it has assisted in the promotion of a national policy for the training of local administrators , specifically in financial management , as well as facilitating the creation of a Metropolitan Council for the City of San Jos ; and has supported the " State of the Nation " initiative , consisting of a participatory scheme to produce an annual report of the country 's sustainable human development performance and its most significant challenges . 
Activities being initiated include reviewing the current state of interpreting modelling work for sustainable development ; formulating recommendations for improving existing integrated modelling work for sustainable development ; developing a linked set of models for integrated global and regional assessments of sustainable development ; stimulating the development and use of integrated models in developing countries ; and providing support to relevant activities of different bodies . 
The goal of the Plan is to bring a region-wide focus to ongoing and envisioned efforts of countries and external agencies to help achieve political , social and environmental stability and sustainable economic development in the entire Great Lakes region .  
Thus , it should improve and support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development , concentrating on the needs of the population and the eradication of poverty .  
The Administrative Committee on Coordination , at its October 1995 session , in order to ensure that the United Nations system effectively provides support for the integrated implementation at the country level of the action programmes that emerged from the World Summit for Social Development and other recent United Nations conferences , established inter-agency task forces , respectively , on basic social services for all , chaired by UNFPA ; employment and sustainable livelihoods , chaired by ILO ; and the enabling environment for economic and social development , chaired by the World Bank .  
Under the new initiative it would be determined after the initial three-year period whether Naples terms , together with comparable relief by non-Paris Club bilateral donors and commercial creditors , would be sufficient to put the country in a sustainable debt-service position .  
Accordingly , we not only commit our own efforts but also call on international , hemispheric and regional intergovernmental organizations to participate actively in organizing and following up the tasks to ensure that the summit on sustainable development to be held in Bolivia on 7 and 8 December 1996 is a historic occasion , laying the foundations of a hemispheric agenda for sustainable development that will be the core of national and international actions geared to meeting economic , social and environmental objectives .  
While the eradication strategy relied heavily on the use of insecticides to reduce or interrupt malaria transmission and attempted to eliminate infection through case detection and treatment , using the same approaches in all areas , the current strategy aims to control malaria disease through early diagnosis and prompt treatment , including improving the management of severe and complicated malaria , controlling epidemics and using preventive measures that are locally effective and sustainable .  
Having set out , in a number of principles and commitments , guidelines for making settlements healthier , safer , more humane and sustainable , the Habitat Agenda then proposes a comprehensive set of objectives and actions , based on two themes : ( a ) adequate shelter for all and ( b ) sustainable human settlements development in an urbanizing world .  
On the basis of an analysis of existing national plans , the broadest demand for technical assistance and cooperation in the follow-up to Habitat II is likely to be in institutional development , capacity-building and facilitation / enablement , with emphasis on the following components of effective governance for sustainable human settlements : legal frameworks and institutional structures , consultative and participatory processes , research and policy development , planning processes , management systems , financing modalities , training systems , information systems , communication networks , and technology transfer processes .  
The proposed project is also concerned with achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable social and human development ; reproductive health including family planning and sexual health ; and gender sensitivity and women 's empowerment .  
The situation of refugees , returnees and displaced persons in Africa has continued to be influenced by the harsh socio-economic realities of the continent and the related problems of the evolution of viable political institutions and processes based on democratic principles that will accommodate the diversity of cultures and the aspiration for peace , security and sustainable development .  
In its resolution 49 / 103 , the General Assembly urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the development agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable productive agriculture and food security in developing countries .

It has established national committees in more than 80 countries , and through its regular meetings and special seminars has played a major role in the exchange of experience and technical information on the sustainable use and conservation of water in food production .  
Danish development policy is an integral part of Danish foreign policy , in which the main objectives are , inter alia : promotion of common security , promotion of democratic government and human rights , creation of economic and social development and ensuring ecologically sustainable development .  
Participants in the high-level segment recognized that , in future work , more attention should be paid to addressing the driving forces that impacted on the sustainable management of natural resources while at the same time giving more attention to the economic and social dimensions of sustainable development , including combating poverty .  
The Committee agreed that the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions and other relevant bodies , should actively contribute to making the special session a highly visible international event that would energize global commitment to the implementation of Agenda 21 and advance international dialogue and action for sustainable development .  
The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , at its fifth session , held from 21 to 31 May 1996 , was informed of the Institute 's efforts to promote regional technical cooperation and to coordinate activities in crime prevention , thus aiming at the promotion of sustainable development and respect for the rule of law by making criminal justice systems more effective in Africa .  
Considering the priority that African Governments are giving to achieve economic growth and sustainable development , considering also the challenge of growing criminality , both national and transnational , it is imperative that all measures that are being taken to achieve sustainable development are linked with crime prevention and criminal justice .  
Policy interactions and programme cooperation are also being expanded in the context of the arrangements made by ACC to promote the integrated follow-up to recent United Nations global conferences ( the World Bank chairs the thematic ACC task force on the enabling environment and participates actively , together with the International Monetary Fund , in two other inter-agency task forces on basic social services for all and on employment and sustainable livelihood ) , and of the System-wide Special Initiative on Africa .

The basic objective of the project is to contribute to the progressive elimination of opium cultivation by the Hmong ethnic group in a remote area through the introduction of sustainable social and economic development processes ;  
Those programmes were beginning to bear fruit : the level of absolute poverty had been reduced while per capita income had increased ; economic growth had been sustained ; the debt service ratio had decreased in relation to exports ; and the Philippines had re-entered the private capital market in order to seek sources of external financing .  27 .  In order to promote sustainable human development to achieve real prosperity , economic growth in developing countries must reach between 5 and 9 per cent .  
The World Food Summit was a fitting end to that series of conferences and a bridge into the future because it addressed the primary needs of all mankind and proposed solutions for food security and sustainable agricultural development at the global level . 
Although it acknowledged the critical role of national policies in that regard and the Organization 's efforts to raise awareness in the world community , it believed that sustainable development required a favourable international economic environment .  
Despite considerable efforts , the Commission had been unable to balance viewpoints and to catalyse decisive action by the international community , not only on financial resources but also on other cross-sectoral issues such as the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , economic instruments for sustainable development and the relation between international trade and the environment . 
The Commission on Sustainable Development , whose establishment had been one of the most important results of the Rio Conference , played a vital role in mobilizing a political commitment to safeguard the environment and was promoting sustainable consumption patterns , a particularly relevant issue in view of the threat to the environment posed by the culture of mass consumption fostered by the market mechanisms that were being introduced into the developing world .  
The Commission continued to alert the international community to extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions ; torture and enforced disappearance ; arbitrary detention ; violence against women , children and vulnerable groups ; the problem of internally displaced persons , extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , etc .

The Secretary-General believed that priority should be given to such areas as the maintenance of international peace and security ; the promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in the developing world ; the promotion of development in Africa ; the protection of human rights ; more effective responses to humanitarian emergencies ; and the promotion of justice and international law .  
With reference to a participatory approach to sustainable human settlements through the development and support of strategies and mechanisms that encouraged open and inclusive dialogue among all interested parties , it was stressed that special attention needed to be paid to minorities .  
Recognize that increased use of solar energy can reduce environmental degradation caused by adverse human activities , such as industrial pollution and deforestation , and that it is the responsibility of Governments and all sectors of civil society to work together to find lasting solutions to problems threatening the sustainable development of humanity ;  
Are convinced that sustainable development and the utilization of solar energy would be enhanced by local and national capacity-building , policy reform and technology-sharing among nations , with an emphasis on coherent efforts towards technology acquisition and development in the developing countries . 
Acknowledging that there are links , under certain circumstances , between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments which request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Major initiatives in the economic management , public sector reform and decentralization area included the assistance to the completion of a comprehensive national Economic Management Capacity-Building Programme ( EMP ) , adopted by the Government in mid-1995 , one component of which is targeted at aid policy and coordination ; the associated Programme Support Document ( PSD ) , which also contemplates the formulation of a sustainable human development ( SHD ) strategy ( with UNICEF ) ; and the continued support to reconstruction and development planning at the provincial and district levels .  
Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,  
In order to assist , in particular , small and medium enterprises which had neither the resources nor the expertise required to reduce environmental pollution , strong support should be extended to the concept of environmentally sustainable industrial development and the Area-Wide Environmental Quality Management Plan developed by the United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment and its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
In this regard , the Government of Belarus would like to refer to the intention previously expressed by the United Nations Secretariat of reviewing and approving at a forthcoming meeting of the Quadripartite Committee for Coordination on Chernobyl the phases and modalities of action by the United Nations to encourage donors to extend generous and tangible assistance for the purpose of advancing medical and environmental projects and programmes capable of reviving the sustainable development of the three countries that suffered most as a result of the Chernobyl disaster .  
Expressing her delegation 's strong interest in pursuing durable solutions , she cited the innovative and comprehensive approaches developed by UNHCR for addressing population movements and said that voluntary repatriation should combine the elements of sustainable development , a community-based approach and a focus on returnee communities .  
The fundamental importance of the law of the sea institutions for international peace and security , the peaceful settlement of disputes , the sustainable development of marine resources and the protection of the environment has allowed them to evolve successfully , despite the increasing financial difficulties for Governments in providing for institutional development at the international level .  
Among other actions , the Subcommittee agreed that the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities would be considered as the cooperative programme framework for programme areas A ( integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ) and B ( i ) ( marine environmental protection : land-based sources ) .  
The topic touches not only on the protection and preservation of the marine environment , including that of the international seabed area , but also on such other matters as the application of the consent regime for marine scientific research , the regime for protected areas in the exclusive economic zone , the duties of conservation and management of the living resources of the high seas , and the sustainable development of living marine resources generally .  
SBSTTA has recommended that this expert group should concentrate on determining the following areas where the Biodiversity Convention can have the greatest effect : integrated marine and coastal area management , marine and coastal protected areas , sustainable use of coastal and marine living resources , mariculture and alien species . 193 Other items of particular note discussed by SBSTTA included the economic valuation of biological diversity and its components , in particular in relation to access to genetic resources ( art . 15 of the Convention ) .  
The recommendation was based on the following needs : " ( a ) to better identify priorities for action at the global level to promote conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment ; ( b ) for better coordination among the relevant United Nations organizations and intergovernmental financial institutions ; ( c ) to ensure sound scientific , environmental , economic and social advice on these issues . "  
Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
It therefore welcomed the set of measures outlined in subprogramme 5.4 ( Sustainable development ) which was intended to develop a comprehensive framework for the more effective integration of the social , economic and environmental aspects of sustainable development embracing the relevant sectoral and cross-sectoral components of Agenda 21 and incorporating the results of other major United Nations conferences held in recent years .  
India fully supported the need for global efforts to address the whole range of refugee-related problems , including their security and protection , international solidarity and burden-sharing , supporting the capacity of host States to receive and protect refugees , seeking sustainable solutions to refugee problems within countries of origin in order to prevent new exoduses , developing durable solutions and creating conditions for the repatriation of refugees in a manner that ensured their safety and their effective reintegration .  
The focus of the subprogramme is to maximize the positive impact of globalization and liberalization on sustainable development by assisting in the effective integration of developing countries , in particular the least developed and certain developing countries with structurally weak and vulnerable economies , including those countries which are commodity-dependent , into the international trading system .  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for development ,  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
Requests the Secretary-General , in cooperation with the relevant organs and organizations of the United Nations system and in close cooperation with the Nicaraguan authorities , to continue to provide , within existing resources , all necessary assistance to activities for the reconstruction , stabilization and development of Nicaragua and to continue to ensure the timely , comprehensive , flexible and effective formulation and coordination of programmes of the United Nations system in Nicaragua , given the importance of those activities for the consolidation of peace , democracy and sustainable development ;

Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries , which should be achieved through a once-and-for-all approach , can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Also stresses the need for , in addition to debt-relief measures that include debt and debt-service reduction , new financial flows to debtor developing countries , and urges creditor countries and multilateral financial institutions to continue to extend concessional financial assistance , particularly to the least developed countries , in order to support the implementation of economic reforms , stabilization and structural adjustment programmes and the eradication of poverty by the developing countries so as to enable them to extricate themselves from the debt overhang and to assist them in achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Thus , it should improve and support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development , concentrating on the needs of the population and the eradication of poverty .  
In subprogramme 8.2 , on environment and social development management , it should be mentioned that the lack of financial and technological resources , information and technical knowledge and the debt crisis and unemployment are factors that have a negative impact on the environment and social development , as well as that eradication of poverty is of maximum importance for the developing countries and constitutes a basic condition for attaining sustainable development .  
Although the focus of the proposed programme on the three major themes of regional economic cooperation , environment and sustainable development , and poverty alleviation , is welcomed , there may be a need to sharpen the subprogramme elements further to better reflect desired activities in conformity with relevant legislative mandates , including the recently held United Nations Conference on Human Settlements ( Habitat II ) .  
The European Union is convinced that the role of the United Nations in the field of development activities would be substantially strengthened if the three secretariat departments with responsibilities in this area were to be merged under the authority of a single Under-Secretary-General responsible for policy formulation and coordination in the fields of sustainable development and economic cooperation , while coherence and coordination of operational activities should also be appropriately enhanced through the strengthening of the relevant secretariat function .  
Acknowledging that there are links , under certain circumstances , between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and that take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] / in which the national and regional strategy known as the alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
In the economic and social sectors , services of gratis personnel have been contributed by Governments and institutes to assist in carrying out work at Headquarters , primarily in areas where specific expertise was required to assist the Secretariat , for example , national accounts , research and analysis of the world economic and social situation , development of indicators of sustainable development and monitoring programmes of action and other international instruments in the economic and social sectors .  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
The experience of his country and others which had introduced basic economic reforms in tandem with systemic reforms confirmed that the successful pursuit of sustainable growth required that individuals be given the opportunity to be the active agents of change , that they must enjoy basic human rights and freedoms and that entrepreneurship should be encouraged .  
The purpose of the present report , which has been prepared in response to that request , is to provide an objective review and appraisal of the current conditions and trends in the exploitation and consumption of natural resources in human settlements , with a view to identifying imminent threats to sustainability , and to provide options for strategic interventions that could put current consumption patterns on to a sustainable track .  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
While Government and other stakeholders have been dedicating resources to the development of new financial instruments to address sustainable forestry , the huge shifts in global capital markets over the last five years suggest that the main issue for capturing private sector funding for forest management is not developing new financial instruments , but linking existing investment flows more directly to sustainability and with sustainable forest management in particular . 
In order to address these concerns and to reach the goal of economically efficient , socially balanced and ecologically sound sustainable forest management , the experts call upon the Governments , private sector and investment community , multilateral international organizations , non-governmental organizations and the voluntary sector to recognize their shared responsibility and to take urgent action as follows :  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Requests the Commission on Human Settlements to review at its sixteenth session , its working methods in order to involve in its work the representatives of local authorities or international associations of local authorities , as appropriate , and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector and non-governmental organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , taking into account the rules of procedure of the Commission on Human Settlements and the relevant provisions of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 31 ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access and access to international financial markets , flow of financial resources , trade practices , access to technology and technological infrastructure , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Stresses the importance for developing countries of continuing their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment , thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development , and stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external economic environment through , inter alia , improved market access , stabilization of exchange rates , effective stewardship of international interest rates and increased resource flows , as well as improved access to technology for the developing countries ;  
Welcomes the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative endorsed by the Interim Committee of the International Monetary Fund and the Development Committee of the World Bank , designed to enable eligible heavily indebted poor countries to achieve a sustainable debt situation through coordinated action by all creditors on the basis of adjustment efforts by the debtor countries necessary to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Bearing in mind that all countries , particularly the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , to narrow imbalances , and to cooperate with the developing countries so as to enhance their ability to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of money , finance , resource flows , trade , commodities and external indebtedness ,  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions , and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
He called on the secretariat to take into account , in all aspects of its work , the prevailing critical situation of those Latin American and Caribbean countries that had structurally weak and vulnerable economies , especially in the application of technical cooperation programmes , with a view to enabling governments to create an environment that was conducive to sustainable development and strengthening these countries ' capacity to participate fully in the international economy , trade and investment .  
The issues of the environment and development required a global rather than a selective approach ; for the developing countries , the eradication of poverty , together with economic and social development , remained the first priorities and should be an integral part of the strategy for sustainable development .  
In view of the enormous negative effects of natural disasters on the economic and social development of countries , national , regional and international programmes for sustainable development should always take into consideration activities for disaster prevention , preparedness and mitigation .  
In order to implement Agenda 21 in a satisfactory manner , it was imperative to create conditions for environmental protection and sustainable development at both the national and international levels and ensure compliance with common but differentiated responsibilities .  
Reaffirms the need to encourage constructive dialogue and partnership based on mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development as well as improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development ;  
Requests the Commission on Human Settlements to review at its sixteenth session , its working methods in order to involve in its work the representatives of local authorities or international associations of local authorities , as appropriate , and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector and non-governmental organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development , taking into account the rules of procedure of the Commission on Human Settlements and the relevant provisions of Economic and Social Council resolution 1996 / 31 of 25 July 1996 ;  
" Deeply concerned by the continuing loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , the provision of financial resources , technology transfer , respect for each country 's intellectual property rights , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the use of genetic resources , in particular for the developing countries ,

Strongly calls upon the international community to provide assistance and support for effective participation of all concerned countries in the implementation of their commitments in the field of environment and sustainable development , inter alia , through technical and financial assistance and the use of other appropriate mechanisms , including bilateral and regional channels and multilateral institutions and funds ;  
The draft resolution before us on large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing , unauthorized fishing in zones under national jurisdiction and fisheries by-catch and discards draws attention to a number of damaging practices that continue to threaten a sustainable future for the world 's living marine resources .  
It proposes the establishment of a new oceanic order in the twenty-first century , as well as the joint management and scientific development of marine resources on an equitable and peaceful basis so as to maintain the ecological balance of oceans and achieve the sustainable development of marine resources .  It calls on States parties to the Convention to strengthen cooperation and establish joint management and development zones of marine resources .  
Regardless of the approach adopted by individual countries , NFPs or other relevant policy frameworks , as long-term iterative processes , should be based on [ guiding principles recognizing ] the following key elements : national sovereignty and country leadership ; consistency with national policies and international commitments ; integration with the country 's sustainable development strategies ; partnership and participation ; [ and ] holistic and intersectoral approaches that recognize forests as diverse ecosystems ; and secure land and property rights . 7 bis .  
The Panel also recognized the need for an external economic and commercial environment that is supportive of NFPs and , in particular , the need for these programmes to be supported by a market context that enhances the economic value of forest resources and ensures adequate and remunerative prices with respect to the sustainable use of those resources . 
Encouraged national authorities to consider the need to enhance capacities in all relevant sectors , including [ public , private ] [ the public and private sectors , indigenous peoples , local communities ] and non-governmental sectors , [ effectively and in a coordinated manner , ] taking into account the role played by each of the interested parties in the [ sustainable development ] [ management , conservation and sustainable development of all types ] of forests , in order to achieve country-led design and implementation of NFPs .  
It [ is only possible ] [ may be helpful ] to decide whether changes in forest cover are [ or are not harmful against ] [ beneficial or not by considering ] a background represented by a national policy framework for [ sustainable forest management ] [ the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests ] that encompasses and harmonizes elements pertaining to social and economic development programmes , environment plans , land-use plans , and national biodiversity strategies and action plans .  
The Panel recommended that indigenous people , forest owners , forest dwellers and local communities should be enabled to play a [ key ] role in [ defining ] participatory [ approaches to forest and land-use management ] [ approaches to sustainable forest management and land-use planning ] [ with the involvement of ] [ together with ] all interested relevant parties from both public and private sectors , and with greater focus on resource management , land-use systems and conflict resolution . 
[ Urged ] [ ( iv ) Urging ] Governments to promote digital mapping ( using geographical information systems ( GIS ) and global positioning systems ( GPS ) combined with social mapping for establishing forest holdings and values ; assisting planning and management partnerships ; and assisting in the [ location of cultural and ] [ storage of ] geographical information required to support [ sustainable forest management schemes ; ] [ the management , protection and use of TFRK ] ;  
The Panel recognized that in developing countries domestic resources for the financing , management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forest are scarce and international financial sources remain vital .  
The Panel emphasized that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is an [ essential ] [ important ] basis for sustainable forest management , and for a wide range of considerations related to forests [ and forest ecosystems ] at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests such as fuelwood , [ the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of benefits of ] biological diversity , soil and water conservation protection functions , carbon sequestration and other social , cultural and economic aspects are rarely covered and will need more attention .  
These should fully recognize the ecological , social , cultural and [ religious ] [ spiritual ] values of forests [ and pay particular attention to global dimensions of climate change and the sustainable use , conservation and equitable sharing of the benefits of biological diversity . ]  
Developing countries which have only recently joined such processes , or which are about to join , should , as appropriate , be assisted through action aimed at poverty alleviation ; institutional strengthening ; human resource development , with special consideration to gender issues and to education and training at all levels ; establishment of mechanisms for increased public participation ; research and technology transfer ; research networking ; ensuring access to , and dissemination and exchange of , information ; development of plans and programmes ; and field-level testing of criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management ;  
The Panel recognized that the [ agreements reached ] [ documents adopted ] at UNCED have significantly [ underlined ] [ increased ] the understanding that forest policy and sustainable forest management must be [ reconciled ] [ addressed ] , taking into account the multiple benefits of forests [ at the national , regional and global levels ] and that these issues need to be addressed through a holistic and integrated approach [ rather than in a fragmented manner ] .  
The Panel underscored the need for international institutions to support national , [ subregional ] [ subnational ] , regional and international action towards sustainable forest management , [ building a consensus on approaches [ and standards ] worldwide and improving the conditions for adequate capacity-building and financing ] [ to build consensus on approaches and better coordinate their international cooperation efforts ] for [ sustainable forest management ] [ the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests ] .  
At the same time , the Panel acknowledged that at present no single multilateral body , organization or instrument has either a mandate or the capacity to address , in a balanced , [ integrated ] [ holistic ] and mutually reinforcing way , all forest-related issues currently on the international agenda on sustainable forest management .  
The Panel agreed that [ existing or any future body of ] [ any future ] international forest-related legal mechanism [ s ] must deal cohesively with all the interrelated social , economic , trade , environment , development , production , financial and technology issues and have a concrete impact on the future successful implementation of [ sustainable forest management ] [ management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forests ] worldwide .  
In recognition of the interdependence and mutually reinforcing nature of democracy , development and human rights , human rights education under the Decade shall seek to further effective democratic participation in the political , economic , social and cultural spheres , and shall be utilized as a means of promoting economic and social progress and people-centred sustainable development .  
M'MELLA ( Kenya ) said that , in view of his Government 's belief that the integration of environmental policies into national development strategies was an essential component for sustainable socio-economic and human development , it had ratified all the three major conventions that had been prepared pursuant to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development .  
The understanding of the relationship between the environment and sustainable development , coupled with the call by the Rio Conference for an authentic , durable and widespread change of habits and attitudes , especially in industrialized countries , would create a pattern for development that was not only environmentally and socially sustainable , but also equitably distributed with the human person as its central focus .  
Topics that should be included in the discussions of the special session of the General Assembly included : international cooperation in the area of finance and technology ; consideration of the crucial role of the private sector with a view to proposing initiatives for stimulating private investment in sustainable development projects ; relationship between production and energy consumption and the interaction between energy and atmosphere ; international discussions on forests ; the challenge of urbanization ; and the strengthened role of the Commission on Sustainable Development as a political forum .  
In conclusion , the FAO report entitled " World Agriculture : Towards 2010 " addressed many issues related to Agenda 21 , in particular the technical and environmental challenges to sustainable agricultural development and the potential for future agricultural growth ; studies of technology reviews ; the natural resource base ; prevailing agricultural policies ; trade liberalization ; the trade-offs between the environment and agricultural development ; and implications for the future .  
His delegation was also encouraged by regional activities designed to implement Agenda 21 and by the fact that , at the national level , approximately 100 countries had reformed their institutional structures with a view to achieving sustainable development .  
A wide programme of eradication of coca plants , poppies and marijuana crops continued to be carried out , and continued efforts were being made to obtain additional resources through international cooperation to complement those already invested in the country 's alternative development programme , which constituted an economically sustainable solution for peasant and indigenous families , and a long-term solution for elimination of the illicit supply of drugs .  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] in which the national and regional strategy known as the alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
Also emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are indispensable foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and takes note with appreciation of the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 , [ 4 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Thus , it should support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development .  
" Decides that the priorities for the biennium 1998-1999 are the following : maintenance of international peace and security ; promotion of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and recent United Nations conferences ; development of Africa ; promotion of human rights ; effective coordination of humanitarian assistance efforts ; promotion of justice and international law ; disarmament ; drug control , crime prevention , as well as combating international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations ; "  
The reality is that no State can long remain just or free , and thus also have the potential to pursue a successful and sustainable development strategy , if its citizens are prohibited from participating actively and substantially in its political processes and economic , social and cultural development .  
Yet vigorous and effective local governance is essential not only to global problem-solving : by contributing to health and sustainable human settlements , it is also essential to international peace and security in the broadest sense .  
The same can be said of the pioneering efforts under way towards linking international organizations , both governmental and non-governmental , with national and private multinational banks in order to provide the funds and services which small and medium-sized entrepreneurs in transitional and developing countries require for sustainable development activities .  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the Urban and Housing Indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in the civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , i.e . , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
Sweden has identified eight policy areas which represent the most fundamental and important challenges that have to be addressed effectively in the short and medium term in the country to ensure adequate shelter for all and the sustainable development of Swedish human settlements .  
Thus , it should support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people centred sustainable development .  
Although there is no universal prescription for successful development , a consensus has emerged , inter alia , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework of our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
From these conferences , a consensus has emerged on a multidimensional , comprehensive and integrated approach to development which recognizes , among others , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
When we met during the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held only four months ago , we all expressed our deep concern that , compared to 1992 , the overall trend regarding sustainable development in developing countries is worse today .  
The paradigm of sustainable development , based on economic growth that is sustained , socially equitable and ecologically viable , constitutes the common denominator on which the international community now agrees in order to give new direction to the collective search for the economic and social well-being of our peoples .  
As Mali sees it , any work towards sustainable development is above all a national responsibility , through the effective definition and application of sound macroeconomic policies , based on transparency , the pre-eminent rule of law , the practice of democracy , respect for human rights , social justice , and the participation of all in the effort of national development .  
These conferences provided a starting point for a global effort in advancing sustainable development , set goals and defined broad plans of action that provided the basis on which national and international actions could proceed .  
Today it is universally accepted that sustainable development could be attained if it were approached in a comprehensive manner , and that sustained economic growth is closely linked with social development and environmental protection .  
Indeed , increased cooperation between the two organizations will , we hope , make it possible to establish the foundations for international cooperation that is free from ideological confrontation and resolutely determined to meet its global challenges : economic and social development ; strengthening democracy and respect for human rights ; the promotion of sustainable development while taking account of the need for environmental conservation ; the struggle against the scourge of drugs ; and the promotion of gender equality .  
The struggle of developing countries to eradicate poverty , achieve economic and social progress and attain conditions of sustained economic growth and sustainable development has as a prerequisite sine qua non the establishment of a more propitious and dynamic economic environment .  
Two years ago , during the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Nations , we committed ourselves not only to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war , but also to rededicate our efforts to achieve greater efficiency and effectiveness for our universal Organization , with a view to enabling it to play a pivotal role in promoting sustainable development , particularly in the developing countries .  
It is our earnest desire to take maximum advantage of the rich potential of our natural resources and to use them in a sustainable and balanced manner with a view to creating wealth and a better future for our people .  
The agenda of that meeting attests to the interest of both organizations in such international and regional questions as the political question of the maintenance of international peace and security or humanitarian questions such as mine clearance , as well as other questions dealing with economic and social cooperation , sustainable development , the environment , combating drugs , crime prevention , agricultural and rural development , family planning , population and health .  
I believe it is time that we members of the Conference began to assert the strength of our numbers and potential influence and aired our collective opinions on the vital issues of the day , such as in the realm of global peace and security , environmental protection and conservation , sustainable development , human rights and overall economic and social development . 
Following the peaceful changes that took place in Benin after the National Conference of Active Forces of the Nation in February 1990 , the people of Benin have been experiencing an era of democratic renewal based , inter alia , on the building of the rule of law , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development through its three component factors economic , social and environmental .  
Governance is effective only where three key elements the State , the private sector and civil society function in partnership in creating the political , economic and social conditions which are conducive to ensuring sustainable human development .  
The objective of sustainable development should be the integration of environmental , economic and social policies in order to meet basic human needs and to manage the environment on a sustainable basis .  
The main objective of this doctrine is the gradual realization of a global civil society , a society where liberty and salvation harmoniously coincide to meet the spiritual and material needs of humanity in an institutionalized manner , and where comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development lies at the foundation of universal cooperation and participation .  
In our view , we can move towards the gradual realization of a global civil society through institutionalization of these two fundamental principles and by committing ourselves to pluralism , tolerance , dialogue among civilizations , promotion of human rights , comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development , justice and equality of opportunities as the governing norms in our interactions .  
Expansion and broadening of the participatory base of the future global order on the basis of norms acceptable to all cultures and peoples is most conducive to building a better tomorrow , and to ensuring freedom , security , stability and sustainable development at the national , regional and international levels .  
Only a reformed and revitalized United Nations can create the foundation for a global partnership between developing countries , developed countries and multilateral organizations , with the prime objective of achieving sustained and sustainable development .  
It is relevant here to highlight the need for the international community to continue its cooperation with the Central American countries by providing the required economic , financial and technical assistance in sustained fashion and on favourable terms in order to make the goals of the programme of sustainable development in Central America achievable .  
Emphasizes the importance of supporting and strengthening the new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities laid down in the new sustainable development programme for the region .  
Landmines exact a high human , social , economic and environmental cost and make it difficult to create the conditions needed for sustainable development in afflicted regions .  
But the main specific feature is that all these Republics are in the process of building a State , and therefore give the highest priority to the issues of peace , security and stability in their domestic and foreign policies , because only with these basic conditions is sustainable economic and social development possible .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in the industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful in their development processes .  
You have moved forward in several areas , such as the management of forests and fresh water , in the commitment to discuss energy and transport from the perspective of sustainable development and in more specific actions , such as the phasing out of leaded gasoline and the ambitious work programme you have set for the Commission on Sustainable Development .  
Let the message go back to the various capitals , to non-governmental organizations and to all stakeholders that the achievement of sustainable development requires nothing less than action that integrates economic , environmental and social components into decision-making and programmes , and the resurgence of a true global partnership based on common but differentiated responsibilities .  
I wish to express our appreciation to all of the nations and international agencies that are supporting us technically and financially in order to reverse the consequences of the conflict that ravaged El Salvador , and we invite the international community to accompany us in our transition towards sustainable development with timely and flexible assistance . 
Future international action should address the oceans , particularly the sustainable use of marine resources through improved environmental approaches to marine ecology ; the protection and sustainable use of fresh water and wetland habitats , particularly in arid regions ; the protection and sustainable use of forests and woodlands ; and the problems of hazardous chemicals .  
Mr . Afful ( Ghana ) : Five years ago we met in Rio de Janeiro to elaborate integrated strategies aimed at achieving two major goals : first , to halt and reverse the negative impact of human behaviour on the physical environment , and secondly , to promote sustainable economic development in all countries .  
The concept of sustainable development as a mean between the imperatives of development and the protection and conservation of the physical environment , including our natural resources , calls for the promotion of an international economic environment that is conducive to and supportive of the development efforts of all countries , particularly those of the developing world , many of which are still grappling with the provision of basic social services for their populations .  
A policy that is geared towards a sustainable development model is conceivable and feasible only through international political intervention an intervention that implies a spirit of cooperation and solidarity among the industrialized countries , the developing countries and the poorest parts of the world . 
If sustainable development is as no one can doubt , if only by dint of the precautionary principle the essential purpose of international policy , it is important to envisage a method of ensuring that there is an open and responsible participatory implementation among all nations and at the national level .  
The United Nations system has a key role to play in dealing with the development migration nexus by addressing the root causes of migration ; strengthening national , regional and global efforts to achieve sustainable development ; and supporting efforts to ensure orderly migration while promoting and protecting the human rights of migrants .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
This initiative now offers the possibility of a significant and sustainable resource base for addressing many toxic chemical issues at the global , regional , and national level .  
While there has been an increased recognition of the importance of science and a considerable increase in international planning and coordination to provide the scientific basis for sustainable development , the actual amount of money being spent on scientific activities in a majority of both developing and developed countries has declined since 1992 .  
Scientific illiteracy remains a major impediment in developed and developing countries alike for a better understanding of environment and sustainable development problems and for ensuring a full participation of the public at large in finding and supporting solutions to these problems .  
A number of important initiatives have been launched to develop high-level scientific capacities in developing countries ( with particular reference to the least developed countries ) so as to enable these countries to address local problems and to participate fully in regional and international activities related to important issues such as sustainable water and coastal zone management , global change and the conservation and sustainable utilization of biodiversity .  
Without genuine political will on the part of the international community , expressed in the form of cooperative arrangements , through , for example , the United Nations system and its various organizations , these most basic gaps will persist , seriously compromising efforts to move towards sustainable development .  
Where Stockholm adopted an issue-oriented approach to pollution and non-renewable resource depletion , Rio emphasized integrated strategies to promote human development through economic growth based on sustainable management of the natural resource base .  
A partnership for development should be forged in which developed and developing countries would undertake , in a framework of growing interdependence and joint responsibility , to establish sensible national policies and an international climate conducive to sustainable and accelerated development .  
What is lacking is the development of the social and institutional structures that are needed to keep pace with the policy , regulatory and service demands arising from rapid population growth , increased complexity and the changes in technology ; and underlying this gap is the issue of good governance and its impact on building capacities and developing performance standards for sustainable development . 
Very often , large-scale and sudden movements into areas of already declining environmental and socio-economic conditions lead to a reduction in migrants ' well-being ; damage to the natural resource base on which the local economy depends ; economic and political difficulties for the host areas ; and erosion of efforts made by Governments and the international community to support sustainable development in both areas of origin and host areas .  
Human settlements should therefore be at the centre of concern for sustainable development , as they are essential for social and economic progress and , in an increasingly interdependent world , critical for the well-being of both urban and rural populations ( see box 1 ) .  
As a direct consequence of recommendations of the Commission on Sustainable Development and the Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development ( IACSD ) in 1994 , more than a dozen multilateral and bilateral assistance agencies began discussions leading to the formation of the " Urban Forum " , to serve as a vehicle for information exchange , and joint programming in the field of sustainable human settlements development .  
On another level , the Habitat Agenda also provides clear and detailed expression of the local environmental agenda and priorities of developing countries , which are focused on essential services , such as water supply , sanitation and waste management , among others , and are informed by the relationship between poverty and environmental decline , and thus by the need for sustainable economic growth to address both issues .  
The current approach to energy policy worldwide , which is characterized by a strong emphasis on energy supply , without regard to its social , economic and environmental consequences , does not meet the requirements of sustainable development .  
The current pace of growth in world energy demand , even with a strong emphasis on efficiency , is expected to lead to a substantial increase in aggregate commercial energy demand - under 2 per cent per year between 1995 and 2020.4 The potential consequences of this scenario are profound , if the growth in energy demand is not met in a sustainable manner .  
Subsidies in the energy sector for conventional energy sources and nuclear power tend to hamper widespread development and application of renewable energy sources . 6 Policy changes that will lead to the full internalization of environmental costs in prices through the use of economic and fiscal instruments and the removal of permanent subsidies are required if a sustainable energy path is to be pursued . 
Since the late 1980s , interest in new and renewable sources of energy has begun to surge again , given the emerging concern about the environmental impacts of the growing use of fossil fuels , including their contribution to the emission of greenhouse gases , and general awareness of the need for sustainable energy systems .  
The main objective of chapter 26 is to establish full partnerships between Governments , international organizations and indigenous people . 14 Proposals to achieve the main objective include establishing processes that empower indigenous people ; strengthening the active participation of indigenous people in the formulation of national policies related to resource management ; and involving indigenous people at the national and local levels in programmes related to sustainable development .  
If local action is the basis of sustainable development , future decisions on political and economic resource allocation at the national level will need to give priority to supporting local authorities .  
Several targets are put forward , including promoting the ratification of ILO conventions ; establishing bipartite and tripartite mechanisms on safety , health and sustainable development ; increasing the number of environmental collective agreements ; reducing occupational accidents and injuries ; and increasing workers ' education and training efforts by the year 2000 . 
Although there are numerous examples of good practices by business and industry , the number of companies that are making strides in becoming sustainable development enterprises is small relative to the global total , a disappointing trend given that business and industry is the single most dominant factor influencing the direction of investments and financial flows , as well as the type of products produced and the processes with which they are made . 
Actions that are based on partnership and the involvement of major groups open up a wider political space for a broad list of social and economic actors , which puts the sustainable development challenge in the hands of not only Governments and United Nations bodies but also and equally of local communities , individuals , professional societies , businesses of all sizes and the various organizations of civil society at all levels .  
Further discussions focusing on the major group concept in informal settings , such as inter-sessional workshops or seminars , may help to develop a better understanding of the concept and how it can be further operationalized in the context of local , national , regional and international institutions working on sustainable development .  
The response of individual organizations of the United Nations system to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development 's sustainable development agenda is assessed in terms of the three basic functions of intergovernmental organizations : ( a ) policy development , ( b ) the collection , synthesis , analysis and dissemination of data and information to inform action at all levels and ( c ) the delivery of technical and financial support to strengthen human and institutional capabilities at national and regional levels .  
The role and priorities of UNEP , as reflected in its organizational structure and its successive biennial work programmes since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , indicate a fundamental shift , largely in reaction to Agenda 21 and based on a clear assessment of needs , from a sectoral approach in respect of the environment to a fully integrated strategy , that is responsive to the agenda for sustainable development .  
In other cases , the existing policies and priorities of the agencies emphasized the social , economic , environmental and cultural dimensions underlying sustainable development to a sufficient extent so that new structures were not felt to be necessary .  
It was envisaged that implementation of Agenda 21 would require active involvement of all relevant international institutions , both within and outside the United Nations system , that are dealing with specific economic , social or environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
Affirmation of the economic , social , environmental and cultural principles inherent in the concept of sustainable development would be enhanced by more systematic consideration of the follow-up to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and related major United Nations conferences .  
Given the increased number of decision-making bodies concerned with sustainable development , including those related to the international conventions , there is an ever-greater need for coordination at the intergovernmental level through consistent and coherent positions of Governments in these various forums , as well as for the development and strengthening of a collaborative process among secretariats .  
The collective view of the secretariats of the organizations of the United Nations system is that the concept of sustainable development should continue to provide an " overarching " policy framework for the entire spectrum of United Nations activities in the economic , social and environmental fields at global , regional and national levels .  
These negotiations will have special importance for the future work of the GEF , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national level .  
This programme consists of a regionally focused set of activities aimed at building capacity in developing countries to harness the potential of biotechnology for producing food of sufficient quality and quantity , for providing inexpensive and sustainable sources of energy and for improving human health and overall quality of life .  
As reported in document A / 51 / 506 , draft guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national Plans of Action for human rights education .  
There are numerous regional and global treaties supporting an approach which integrates environment and development , such as the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Desertification Convention . 23 Paragraph 6 of the 1995 Copenhagen Declaration provides that " . . . economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework for our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people " . 
Their declaration recognized that public-private partnerships not only foster sustainable cities , but also generate profitable opportunities for business through increased productivity , a better educated and dynamic work force and improved infrastructure .  
Recognizing the importance of clean and safe energy technologies in the pursuit of sustainable development , the Council , in the same resolution , recommended that the Commission 's secretariat , in consultation with the Committee on New and Renewable Sources of Energy and on Energy for Development and other relevant international bodies , submit to the Commission at its third session an issues note that should identify scientific and technological aspects of sustainable energy systems that might be considered by the Commission in defining its future work programme .  
It should be noted that , for the purposes of the present exercise , all official development finance committed for development assistance is assumed to be dedicated to sustainable development , so that analysis focuses on any changes in the allocation of financial assistance among the economic , social and environmental components of sustainable development that may have been made in response to the series of global conferences beginning with the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and other determinants of aid composition .  
The objectives of the work programme are , first , to promote the positive effects and mitigate the negative impacts of agricultural practices on biological diversity in agro-ecosystems and their interface with other ecosystems ; second , to promote the conservation and sustainable use of genetic resources of actual or potential value for food and agriculture ; and third , to promote the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources .  
In particular , Parties have through the CBD been actively pursuing a strategy of establishing the legal basis to ensure the integrated management and sustainable development of coastal areas , including exclusive economic zones ( programme area A ) and sustainable use and conservation of marine living resources under national jurisdiction ( programme area D ) .  
Following the momentum set at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , but going even further , the CBD as a process is open to " participants " and is not confined to Governments . 21 The Convention 's rules of procedure define participants in a broad manner which essentially encompasses all of the major groups identified in section III of Agenda 21 , so long as they can demonstrate that they are qualified in fields relating to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity . 
Other areas of cooperation under investigation between the Department for Policy Coordination and Sustainable Development of the United Nations Secretariat and the CBD include the development of indicators for measuring the status of relevant environmental factors and the effectiveness of measures taken by both processes within the United Nations system-wide effort towards the development of sustainable development indicators .  54 .  Cooperation between the CBD and the United Nations has not been restricted to the administrative level , but has also included the legislative or policy-making bodies of both processes .  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Bearing in mind that all countries , particularly the major industrialized countries , which have significant weight in influencing world economic growth and the international economic environment , should continue their efforts to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , to narrow imbalances , and to cooperate with the developing countries so as to enhance their ability to address and alleviate their major problems in the areas of money , finance , resource flows , trade , commodities and external indebtedness ,  
Also stresses that private capital flows are an important external source of financing for sustainable development and that attracting such investment requires , inter alia , sound fiscal and monetary policies , accountable governmental institutions and transparent legal and regulatory regimes ;  
Emphasizing also that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of the developing countries , and emphasizing further that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
Emphasizes that democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are indispensable foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and takes note with appreciation of the outcome of the meeting held at Oslo from 23 to 25 April 1996 , [ 4 ] which reaffirmed that promoting access for all to basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
Gender mainstreaming in such substantive areas as economic and social matters , peace and security , human rights , sustainable development and humanitarian affairs requires an institutional culture that is conducive to such mainstreaming .  
In parallel , measures might be designed to ensure that the United Nations system , including the Bretton Woods institutions , attaches priority to coordinating sustainable development cooperation programmes and investments that directly or indirectly support alternative development initiatives , and that Member States act in a coordinated manner in the governing bodies of all relevant parts of the system .  
The SRRP has already funded and implemented hundreds of local initiatives which have sustainable impact in improving the access to basic social services , improving the productive potential of rural communities and establishing sustainable income-generation opportunities for rural populations .  
To make sustainable human development ( SHD ) a reality in this new context , a more integrated approach is required , one that allows economic growth , social equity and environmental sustainability to move forward together .  
Activities include encouraging countries to create a conducive legal and regulatory climate for sustainable energy development ; supporting and financing innovative demonstration projects that promote key technologies ; and supporting the formulation and implementation of national energy action programmes .  
It serves as an expert facility and repository of technical information relating to the sustainable development of small hydropower operations as a viable and environmentally friendly alternative source of energy , particularly in rural areas of developing countries .  
Addressing the general concern that support for Africa is on the wane at a time when countries are making tremendous efforts to lay the groundwork for sustainable economic growth , the Secretary-General of the United Nations launched , on 15 March 1996 , the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on Africa , involving an unprecedented set of coordinated actions designed to maximize support for African development efforts through the combined resources of the United Nations system . 
The Commission recognized that particular attention should be focused on the holistic approach towards environmental and developmental functions of forests ; sustainable forest management ; conservation of biological diversity ; conservation of soil and water resources ; restoration ; forest products and services ; and participation of major groups , particularly indigenous people and local communities .  
Regardless of the approach adopted by individual countries , national forest programmes should be viewed as long-term iterative processes , and should be based on guiding principles recognizing the following key elements : national sovereignty and country leadership , consistency with national policies and international commitments , integration with the country 's sustainable development strategies , partnership and participation , and holistic and intersectoral approaches .  
The general basis for securing sustainable development is the presence of adequate institutions , knowledge , skills and access to technology and financial resources , which will need to converge in the design and demonstration of sustainable - that is , responsible in a long-term perspective - ways of managing the environment , producing goods and services , meeting basic needs , and improving the economic and social standards of living for the world as a whole , especially for the poorest communities . 
After briefly reviewing the achievements of UNCED and continuing impediments to sustainable development , the present report identifies a way forward that includes fiscally responsible government actions , more effective economic incentives , improvement in the enabling conditions for change , and other market-oriented policies designed to optimize sustainable development in the areas of energy , water and transportation , while building in a concern for social equity .  
Despite the concomitant increase in private capital flows , which have been concentrated in a relatively few countries , ODA remains an essential element for sustainable development , especially in least developed and other vulnerable countries , and the commitments for new and additional resources should therefore be met .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , including a focus on the local environment in the context of sustainable development .  
The process of urbanization facilitates sustainable development by giving more people access to productive and sustainable technologies and reducing pressure on ecologically fragile areas ; but it poses enormous problems for urban planning and management , which must meet the growing demand for energy , water and transportation , while coping with increasing volumes of solid , liquid and gaseous wastes .  
That new capital is envisaged to come from a redirection of private capital from mature markets to markets with new absorptive capacity created for sustainable development ; from the removal of existing subsidies ; from domestic savings ; from debt-relief ; and from public monies , including increased ODA . Efforts should be made to provide the necessary flexibility to allow those reallocations to take place naturally in response to incentives . 
There is an urgent need to strengthen democratic and participatory processes for planning and implementing sustainable development so as to involve all concerned social groups at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
There is an urgent need to increase economic incentives for sustainable development based on full and comprehensive pricing that reflects all economic , social and environmental externalities , with targeted and explicit subsidies , where necessary , to prevent social dislocations and hardships for the disadvantaged .  
It agreed that the term " national forest programme " is a generic term for a wide range of approaches to sustainable forest management within different countries , to be applied at national and subnational levels based on the basic principles outlined below .  
It noted the statement annexed to decision II / 9 of the Conference of the Parties to that Convention , and accepted that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from research and development and from the commercial utilization of biological resources fell , inter alia , within the purview of the Convention .  
While recognizing that forest land rehabilitation would be required in many areas and that that would need international assistance , including financial resources and technology transfer to support local and national efforts , the Panel emphasized the need for prevention , rather than mitigation and restoration , wherever practicable , with emphasis on improved and sustainable management of existing natural forest and other vegetation .  
The Panel recognized that in developing countries , domestic resources for financing the management , conservation and sustainable development of all types of forest are scarce and international financial sources remain vital .  
Assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is central to sustainable forest management and to a wide range of other considerations related to forests and forest ecosystems at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Much attention is still given to timber and forest cover , whereas other goods and services provided by forests , such as fuelwood , the sustainable use and conservation and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits of biological diversity , soil and water protection functions , and carbon sequestration and sinks , as well as other social , cultural and economic aspects , are rarely covered and need to be considered .  
The Panel recognized that institutional needs include the strengthening of existing national research institutions ; subregional and regional networks ; joint research ventures ; approaches to enhancing and strengthening existing international , regional , subregional and national forest research institutions ' participation in an international network dedicated to the conservation and sustainable development , management and utilization of forests and forest policy research ; and the creation of appropriate mechanisms that could enable research findings to reach policy and field levels more effectively and could support concrete action .

The countries in transition needed special measures by the international community and the United Nations to promote sustainable agricultural development , and the Russian Federation hoped that the particular interests of those countries would be reflected in an adequate and balanced way in the final document of the World Food Summit .  
In the light of that situation , the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 , had noted with concern that the overall resource allocation for the development of food and agriculture in developing countries had continued to decline and urged the international community to place food and agricultural development high on the agenda and to mobilize resources at the national , bilateral and multilateral levels in support of sustainable agriculture in developing countries .  
His delegation wished to reiterate that in order to achieve global food security , sustainable productive agriculture and the alleviation and eradication of poverty , developed and developing countries alike must cooperate with a view to the urgent and full implementation of the agreements contained in the Uruguay Round , as requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 49 / 103 .

All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
There is a need for concerted action by all countries and for improved cooperation to assist developing countries in implementing the relevant agreements and instruments in order that they may participate effectively in the sustainable use , conservation and management of their fishery resources , as provided for in the Convention and other international legal instruments , and achieve integrated coastal zone management .  
To maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide .  
Noting the vital role of energy in the continuation of sustained economic growth , especially for developing countries , be they importers or suppliers of energy , and recognizing the complexities and interdependencies inherent in addressing energy issues within the context of sustainable development , preparations for this session should be initiated at the seventh session and should utilize an open-ended intergovernmental group of experts on energy and sustainable development to be held in conjunction with inter-sessional meetings of the eighth and ninth sessions of the Commission .  
The international community has recognized the need for an integrated approach to the protection and sustainable management of land and soil resources , as stated in decision III / 11 of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity , [ 34 ] including identification of land degradation , which involves all interested parties at the local as well as the national level , including farmers , small-scale food producers , indigenous people ( s ) , non-governmental organizations and , in particular , women , who have a vital role in rural communities .  
In accordance with the commitments agreed to in the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action , adopted by the World Food Summit , [ 35 ] sustainable food security for both the urban and the rural poor should be a policy priority , and developed countries and the international community should provide assistance to developing countries to this end .

The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
External assistance for building the requisite infrastructure and for national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in accordance with paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 , is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
For developing countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , that is accessible to all and that augments both human capacity and well-being .  
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
An important result of the special session was a strong reaffirmation of political commitment from all Member States and all major groups of civil society to sustainable development , as well as recognition of a key role to be played in this area by the United Nations in close partnership with all actors at various levels .  
In Madrid in October 1994 , the Interim Committee of IMF adopted a declaration on a partnership for sustainable global growth , 4 which the Committee updated and broadened at its autumn ( northern hemisphere ) meeting in 1996.5 This set of international guidelines for macroeconomic and financial policy was intended as a framework for policy-making by all IMF members and to guide the Funds policy discussions with members . 
The Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 122 of 20 December 1995 , reaffirmed that such a dialogue should be conducted in response to the imperatives of mutual interests and benefits , genuine interdependence , shared responsibility and the partnership for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development as well as improving the international economic environment that is conducive to such development .  
The dialogue could build on the work of the High-Level Advisory Board on Sustainable Development , which in 1996 considered how new information technologies that were broadly accessible could contribute to sustainable development by promoting economic growth , improving access to information and promoting civil society . 11 The new technologies , and related institutional changes such as privatization , offer opportunities to extend services to previously unserved communities and to promote broader participation in development , but may also have economic , social and cultural risks . 
Within the technical cooperation project developed by the Office in support of the Decade , aimed at strengthening national capacities for human rights education , guidelines have been prepared to assist Governments in developing comprehensive ( in terms of outreach ) , effective ( in terms of educational strategies ) and sustainable ( over the long term ) national plans of action for human rights education .

In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
National plans of action and other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by Governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , official development assistance is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .

Emphasizes that the Business Plan marks a watershed in the history of the Organization , defines activities to be undertaken by the Organization in future , reinforces the continuation of UNIDO in global forum functions and in areas where UNIDO has comparative advantage , enabling it to function as a specialized agency within the United Nations system in the field of industrial development for supporting the endeavours of developing countries and those in transition to achieve sustainable development ;  
Deeply concerned about the massive loss of human life , the aggravated suffering of the most vulnerable groups , the destruction of property and the serious damage to the economic and social infrastructure of Afghanistan caused by eighteen years of war , and underlining the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and normalcy in Afghanistan and the ability of the country to take effective steps towards a sustainable economic and social development , bearing in mind that the country continues to suffer from an extremely critical economic situation as a landlocked , least-developed and war-stricken country ,  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , international financial organizations and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;  
Stressing the importance of the new programme for the sustainable development of Central America and the setting of national and regional priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural and environmental spheres and in the areas of public security and regional integration ,  
Emphasizes the importance of supporting and strengthening the new programme for international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance for Central America geared to the new circumstances in the region and based on the priorities laid down in the new sustainable development programme for the region ;  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to implement the new programme for the sustainable development of the region ;  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ,  
Most important , the Agenda for Development embodies the consensus of the international community that development means sustainable development ; that is , that improving the quality of life of all people , in both present and future generations , requires integrating economic development , social development and environmental protection , which , as the international community has declared and reaffirmed in various consensus documents , are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission on Human Settlements , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Considering that parliamentarians can contribute substantially to sustainable development by promoting legislative changes , improving public policy and strengthening institutions for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda2 and the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements13 at the local , national , regional and international levels ,  
The Istanbul Declaration and the conference 's plan of action - the Habitat Agenda - provide a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in the urbanized world of the twenty-first century , as well as critical guidance for ensuring that all people have adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
In these roles , it focused on providing assistance to countries for the application of the urban and housing indicators , the preparation of the national plans of action and mobilizing the large variety of actors in civil society to address the two major substantive issues considered by the Conference , that is , adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in an urbanizing world .  
But I feel that it is appropriate to repeat the principal characteristic of our development model , which is a harmonious and rational complementary relationship between economic and social policies , which for the first time in many years is enabling us to carry out a realistic strategy for sustainable human development .  
Accordingly , he continuously advocated in his lifetime the creation of a new global human order premised on sustainable economic development , equity and social and ecological justice , and based on the creation of a separate global development fund for assistance to both the North and the South .  
By building peace , reducing unsustainable military expenditures , promoting equitable and sustainable development and encouraging stable , democratic societies which respect human rights , we not only limit human suffering , but we also address the root causes of conflict itself .  
The Secretary-General has recognized that the future of the United Nations can be secured only by a clearer focus and better coordination of effort , expertise and resources on the key priorities real peace and security , sustainable development , equitable economic and social progress , humanitarian action and , underlying all of these , the safeguarding of universal human rights .  
Malta fully supports the efforts of the Organization in the promotion of environmental protection and the sustainable use of the world \ x { e5b8 } natural resources to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth , and of an international trade regime free of restrictive or discriminatory practices .  
The key elements for attaining sustainable economic development are a sound policy framework that encourages stable growth , a vigorous private sector , the strengthening of institutional and legal foundations and , last but not least , good-governance and anti-corruption measures .  
We must mobilize the dynamic private sector , together with bilateral and multilateral official development assistance to secure sustainable growth and poverty reduction in developing countries .  
Although we were not entirely satisfied with the results of the recent nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held last summer , it is important that that session outlined ways of expediting progress in key areas of sustainable development , as defined in Agenda 21 .  
We are therefore pursuing economic , social and infrastructural development in a sustainable way which avoids environmental degradation , conserves our natural resource endowment and helps to build and maintain a long-term national capacity to support rising standards of living for the population , as well as opportunities for self-actualization .  
For its part the Government of Benin , while awaiting the fulfilment of that hope , has developed the concept of a shared social minimum level in order methodically and effectively to take actions and measures aimed at eliminating poverty , hunger , disease and illiteracy , providing adequate housing , guaranteeing productive employment , improving standards and conditions of living and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources .  
The Sultanate of Oman has prepared a national strategy to protect the environment that aims at achieving balanced and sustainable development , a strategy that would treat economic , social and environmental considerations on an equal footing .  
International cooperation and the benefits that are drawn from it , whether through bilateral or multilateral means , can not be a substitute for what individual countries must do to ensure that sustainable development is achieved and economic growth is realized .  
We are fully aware that at the level of the United Nations , there have been a number of initiatives designed to help address the economic and social problems faced by developing countries and to mitigate the effects of poverty and the impact of those conditions hindering the realization of sustainable economic development .  
In this regard , our objectives are to correct the economic , financial and structural imbalances ; to achieve steadiness and stability in the economy as a whole ; to activate the role of the private sector in the competitive free-market economy ; to achieve sustainable development ; to foster stable environments so as to attract foreign investments ; to upgrade the basic necessary services of society ; and to build the new State and improve the standards of living of all citizens .  
Our Organization , with its universal membership , comprehensive mandate and broad spectrum of activities , is the only global forum able to pursue and achieve the universal goals we all strive for : a secure and peaceful future , a narrowing of the gap between rich and poor , full respect for human rights , free and equitable trade , the protection of the environment and the promotion of sustainable development .  
In our ceaseless struggle as a small nation to achieve people-centred development goals , the present Government , within the international constraints of sustainable development and environmental protection , will continue its endeavours to increase domestic efficiency and international competitiveness in agriculture , production , manufacturing and export , as well as to strengthen the institutions of local entrepreneurship , with a view to ensuring political stability and fostering equitable economic growth .  
The interdependence of the situation emerging in Central Asia , the common European security system taking shape and the outlook for developing situations within the vast Asian continent means there is an urgent need for the international community to take measures to ensure durable peace and stability in this region along with its sustainable development .  
The debate justifies the conclusion that an adequate response to these and other issues is to be delivered through a continuing process of negotiations ; a resolute policy of disarmament , both of weapons of mass destruction and of conventional weapons ; the promotion of sustainable development ; the further strengthening of human rights machinery ; and the gradual reorientation of the United Nations peacekeeping activities toward preventive diplomacy .  
The Commission , which at its thirty-fifth session considered the question of employment and sustainable livelihoods , reached certain agreed conclusions that have as their goal productive employment ; decreasing unemployment through improved social services , such as education and health care ; giving loans to the private sector in both urban and rural areas ; and improving information and guidance services .  
My country appreciates the enormous efforts made by developed and developing countries alike to address the great challenge of sustainable economic and social development , despite the weighty responsibilities imposed upon them by economic reform .  
Not only do basic health and education produce invaluable individual and social benefits , both are essential for sustainable economic development and constitute an investment in people \ x { e5b8 } hope for the future .  
Among the key objectives of this policy are the sustainable development of the region , based on overcoming poverty , and the participation of organized civil society and the population in general , as well as environmental preservation and the rational and sustainable use of natural resources .  
If we do not create an international environment favourable to economic growth and sustainable and comprehensive development , it will be almost impossible , particularly for the large majority of third world countries , to make steady progress along the road to social development .  
In conclusion , I wish to express my delegation \ x { e5b8 } sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Social Summit will help generate renewed political will at the national , regional and international levels to attain the noble objectives of sustainable human development .  
Likewise , in keeping with a modern , integrated concept , the Romanian Government has approached social issues in close relation with economic growth and the complex factors involved in sustainable human development .  
These actions have strengthened the role of the University and allowed for alternative ways of improving quality of living , achieving sustainable development and contributing to the progress of less developed cultures .  
This Assembly is abundant in priorities identified by the recent round of global conferences , particularly in the areas of good governance , human rights , democratization , international economic cooperation and sustainable development , development operations , preventive diplomacy , peaceful settlement of disputes and disarmament , as well as humanitarian action and peacekeeping and post-conflict peace-building .  
In this regard , it should be emphasized that the Jakarta Mandate covering the following areas : integrated marine and coastal area management ; marine and coastal protected areas ; sustainable use of marine and coastal living resources ; and mariculture and alien species called , inter alia , for the effective implementation of the Convention on Biological Diversity concerning marine and coastal biodiversity questions .  
We have consistently extended our firm support to this legal regime , which has paved the path to securing our common goal of ensuring long-term , stable and sustainable living resources of the vast oceans and seas based on cooperation , mutual benefit and shared responsibility .  
Bearing in mind those facts and the requirements of our national societies in an international context that is marked by globalization and the interdependence of the phenomena affecting it , and recognizing that it is difficult for the Central American countries to deal with them individually , we must be more creative in order to ensure that our political and economic integration at the international level will be positive in terms of our goals of democratization and sustainable development .  
Moreover , it is not always true that sustainable development based on private-sector initiatives should be the driving force towards attaining rapid social development and environmental protection in developing countries .  
To most developing countries , the sustainable development approach , as emphasized by most of our developed partners , is considered restrictive , limiting economic growth to social development and protection of the environment .  
Such a dialogue is expected to contribute to the efforts to identify a number of key elements required to respond to the challenges and opportunities emanating from the process of globalization notably , the trends towards closer regional cooperation and integration , growing interdependence , the mutually interdependent link between peace and prosperity , the linkage between the imperatives of the economic and social aspects of promoting sustainable development and the recognition that partnership for development is among the most compelling challenges facing the world community .  
Convinced that economic growth can be achieved only if accompanied by increasing levels of sustainable development , the Central American countries wish to inform the international community of our decision to move forward resolutely towards a common future , a future of great progress and solidarity for our peoples .  
This session is confronted with the onerous task not only of pointing to the imbalances that have emerged since Rio between the advances in political and economic reforms achieved in the third world and the clearly diminishing resources to fund sustainable development , but also of securing a renewed commitment , with firm assurances , to stronger financial aid .  
Although the world community set out on the right path with the adoption of Agenda 21 in Rio , and although steps are being taken on the national and international levels towards achieving our goals , globalization , economic and social disparities , pressing agricultural and industrial needs , serious financial constraints and technological deficiencies all combine to make sustainable development an elusive target .  
During these last five years our initial predictions concerning sustainable development have been justified insofar as this process has proved to be a very complex global endeavour embodying all aspects of human life and requiring awareness and active participation at all levels .  
This multifaceted process of sustainable development necessitates constant and close multilateral cooperation as well as concerted efforts on a regional and national basis .  
It is obvious that without a comprehensive sustainable energy strategy , global warming will continue unabated , urban air with continue to deteriorate and marine pollution will not be halted .  
A well-educated civil service , with high professional standards and resistant to pressure from privileged groups relating to distributional issues , can also be a significant force for stable and sustainable economic policies .  
The Beijing Platform for Action describes poverty as having various manifestations , including lack of income and productive resources sufficient to ensure a sustainable livelihood ; hunger and malnutrition ; ill health ; limited or lack of access to education and other basic services ; increasing morbidity and mortality from illness ; homelessness and inadequate housing ; unsafe environments ; social discrimination and exclusion ; and lack of participation in decision-making and in civil , social and cultural life .  
The Centre for Family Friendly Cities of the University of Akron , Ohio , United States of America , created an interactive communications network on the World Wide Web designed to store , search and retrieve information on , inter alia , family relationships , sexuality and reproduction , special problems and risk factors , family counselling and education , cultural social and urban issues , basic needs , leisure and entertainment , consumption and sustainable development and work .  
Clearing arrears and establishing a sustainable debt-servicing position create an opportunity which , combined with structural adjustment and official financial support , can promote foreign and private investment and , thus , economic growth .  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
As a cooperative activity of UNEP , the World Resources Institute ( WRI ) and IUCN , a set of guidelines on the preparation of biodiversity strategies and action plans was prepared and global biodiversity forums were organized to assist Governments and the public in integrating biodiversity components in improving the understanding of the role of biodiversity in sustainable development and in monitoring implementation and the reporting of progress made .  
Issues of biosafety have emerged with regard to national capacity needed for the implementation of effective in situ conservation measures , through establishing and maintaining the means to regulate , manage or control risks associated with invasive species and / or the use and release of living modified organisms resulting from biotechnology and likely to have adverse environmental impacts on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
The increasing recognition that biotechnology can provide solutions for many problems fundamental to sustainable development makes it essential to establish national legislation to ensure the adequate protection of human health and the environment in connection with the contained use and release of genetically modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnologies .  
A substantial number of countries ( 150 ) have established national-level commissions or coordinating mechanisms designed to develop an integrated approach to sustainable development and to include a wide range of civil society sectors in the process of agenda-setting and strategy-building .  
Paragraph 238 explains that , in the provision of assistance , facilitating mechanisms are to be supported for independent , detached , impartial and objective monitoring of human settlements progress , especially through collecting , analysing and disseminating information and ideas about adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
Progress has been made in creating greater awareness of the mountain agenda and improving coordination of efforts to protect fragile mountain ecosystems and promote sustainable mountain development , largely as a result of international and regional intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations consultations , which have provided a focus on key mountain issues and led to recommendations relevant at both the global and regional levels . 
The global community has also made considerable progress in recognizing the contributions to sustainable agriculture of the conservation and sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , as reflected , for example , in the decision of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity at its third meeting to establish a multi-year programme of activities on the sustainable use of agricultural biological diversity , aiming , inter alia , to promote the positive and mitigate the negative effects of agricultural practices on biological diversity .  
The following important common policy approaches are emerging in the promotion of SARD : ( a ) the use of economic incentives to guide sustainable agricultural practices ; ( b ) education and information exchange for human development ; ( c ) the development and transfer of new and appropriate technologies ; ( d ) farm and off-farm employment for alleviating poverty ; ( e ) sound natural resource management leading to environmental protection ; and ( f ) focusing on men and women farmers themselves .  
However , it clearly places the financing of sustainable development within the global economic context by stating that developing countries will need substantial new and additional funds for the implementation of sustainable development programmes , and that official development assistance ( ODA ) should be a main source of external funding for those countries , especially the least developed countries .  
Nevertheless , the conclusions and recommendations of international experts have regularly emphasized that while private flows are a necessary condition for sustainable development they are not sufficient , because first , most of the poorest countries do not obtain substantial amounts of private capital , and second , sustainable development requires some types of social and environmental investments that do not attract private capital .  
There are some successful models for international financial mechanisms , such as joint implementation programmes ( e.g . , the pilot phase for activities implemented jointly ( AIJ ) established by the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change at its first meeting and international environmental funds ( e.g . , the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) and the Montreal Protocol Environmental Fund ( MPEF ) ) which have transferred developed country resources to developing countries for investments in sustainable development related to the protection of the global environment . 
At its third session , the Commission proposed ways to enhance the effectiveness of ODA through the elaboration of national sustainable development strategies , with the participation of all interested parties ; the use of ODA to leverage additional domestic and external resources , through such schemes as co-financing , joint ventures , underwriting of country risks and venture capital funds ; and the promotion of public and political support in donor countries for raising ODA levels .  
The predominant role of the private sector in the transfer and diffusion of ESTs and , more importantly , its leading function in the transition to cleaner production , have increased the private sector 's responsibility for ensuring that technology-related investments and industrial and business operations are consistent with community requirements for sustainable lifestyles and environmental protection .  
In the initial consultations between UNESCO , UNEP and IUCN on developing a broad international alliance for education for sustainable development , the crucial role of non-governmental organizations and other major groups was stressed .  
The changes called for - reforming educational systems , rethinking the outcomes of education , developing an interdisciplinary conceptual framework that reflects the complexity of the notion of sustainable development , agreeing on the key messages , changing attitude , lifestyles , and so on - will require time and the concerted effort and support of all sectors of society .  
The Brazil / Norway Workshop on Consumption and Production Patterns ( Brasilia , November 1996 ) concluded , among other things , that the role of advertising and the media is critical ; that the international community should apply the resources of the media to induce behavioural changes to avoid waste , inefficient resource use and conspicuous consumption ; and that positive messages of how individuals can live in a sustainable manner were required , instead of encouraging ever-rising material consumption or exaggerating the likelihood of environmental disaster .  
Finally , he emphasized the importance in Africa of the informal sector , which constituted a means of survival for a large part of the urban population but which , in its existing form , deprived of access to finance , information and modern technology , was not sustainable . 
Participating States agreed that effective development and implementation of national programmes of action should focus on sustainable , pragmatic and integrated environmental management , harmonized , as appropriate , with ocean basin management and land-use plans .  
While legal and institutional instruments have definitely improved the basis for sustainable development of oceans and coastal areas , implementation lags behind owing , among other things , to ( a ) the difficulty in making political decisions regarding resources and wealth allocation ; ( b ) the difficulty of improving inadequate or inefficient institutions ; and ( c ) in many cases , difficulties in meeting the related financial commitments .  
Acknowledging that there are links , under certain circumstances , between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures , including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production ,  
Calls upon the international community to provide increased economic and technical support to Governments that request it for programmes of alternative and sustainable development , which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production and which take fully into account the cultural traditions of peoples ;  
Books published during the year covered a number of areas , including sustainable development , the United Nations system , water problems , development economics , urban problems , political and administrative development , social development issues ( drugs and violence ) , gender studies and environmental problems ( including a new series on critical environmental regions ) .  
Yet preoccupation with fiscal consolidation in many developed market economies has led to some shrinkage of social safety nets and stagnation , if not outright reductions , in the volume of official development assistance ( ODA ) .  At the same time , regional conflicts , communal strife and civil war have visited unspeakable tragedy on millions of people - the very antithesis of sustainable development .  
Habitat II ( Istanbul , 1996 ) raised global awareness of the key role of human settlements in sustainable development as the majority of the global population will be living in cities in the next century , thus increasing the urgency of facing the growing social , economic and environmental problems of cities .  
The international community 's attention to this global problem , and the coordination and adoption of an appropriate programme of collective preventive measures , would do much to neutralize or reduce the negative impact of mountain - climate cataclysms on human lives , and would promote the sustainable economic development of mountainous countries and mountain peoples .  
Programme area A ( Promoting sustainable development through trade ) includes among its policy objectives : ( a ) promote an open , non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system ; ( b ) promote access to markets for exports of developing countries ; and ( c ) improve the functioning of commodity markets , and achieve sound , compatible and consistent commodity policies at the national and international levels with a view to optimizing the contribution of the commodity sector to sustainable development , taking into account environmental considerations .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s , ( b ) the potential positive role that transnational corporations could play in conjunction with Governments in achieving global goals on emission standards , and ( c ) the continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
Thus , adopting an integrated treatment of the bases of economic growth , by not only ensuring macroeconomic balance and stability but also directing attention to the industrial base and incentive structures , may do much to enhance the viability of policies that address the environmental and social aspects of sustainable development in individual countries .  
Reaffirms that the implementation of the Platform for Action will require immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and to this end , recognizes that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ;  
Draws attention to the decision of the Presidents of the Central American countries embodied in the Declaration of Gu \ x { 5876 } imo , [ 11 ] in which the national and regional strategy known as the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America2 became an integrated initiative reflected in a programme of immediate action in the political , moral , economic , social and environmental fields , through which the Central American countries hope to become , with the support of the international community , an example of sustainable development for other regions ;  
Further , the main focus of three OSCE seminars undertaken in the last two years was on global and regional partnership in the fields of environment management , environmental regulatory mechanisms and the transfer of environmentally safe technologies , international cooperation in protecting the environment , and promoting the economic and legal framework for environmentally sustainable development .  
Secondly , there has been a growing consensus that positive measures are effective instruments in supporting developing countries in their efforts to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , including in the context of multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) .  
The principal emerging issues with respect to international investment and the need for sustainable development concern ( a ) the incorporation of countries and regions that have not benefited from the FDI boom of the 1990s ; ( b ) the potential positive role that TNCs could play in conjunction with governments in achieving global goals on emission standards ; and the ( c ) continued competition among developing countries for foreign capital .  
As a result of Beijing , a new emphasis has been placed on enabling women to be active decision makers , planners and designers of projects for sustainable development , particularly at the local level ; improving access of women to skills through expansion of extension services and training in science , technology and economics and developing gender-sensitive databases and integrating traditional knowledge of women into resource management programmes .  
Finally , he emphasized the importance in Africa of the informal sector , which constituted a means of survival for a large part of the urban population but which , in its existing form , deprived of access to finance , information and modern technology , was not sustainable . 
The criteria for sustainable development should include better protection of all human rights : civil , cultural , economic , political and social , as well as protection of the most vulnerable and impoverished .  
The experience of countries which have chosen the challenging road to sustainable development , democracy and human rights , and which are already beginning to enjoy the fruits of this decision in the form of interrelated economic progress , political consolidation and social stability , proves that human rights are not only noble ideas .  
Extreme poverty and problems related to sustainable development , international debt , impunity , racism and xenophobia , discrimination against women , ethnic and religious intolerance , mass exoduses and refugee flows , armed conflicts and terrorism , and lack of the rule of law are highlighted by the resolutions of United Nations organs as being major obstacles to the full realization of human rights .  
Thus , it should support , by means of technical cooperation , the activities of Member States aimed at strengthening their administrative and financial systems for development , consolidating institutional capabilities and infrastructures and implementing economic and social policies , according to their national development priorities , so as to contribute to sustainable development .  
The Commission stressed the urgent need for renewed efforts at both the national and international levels to make trade and environmental policies mutually supportive and , more generally , to promote sustainable development , including by designing and implementing positive measures and by providing effective economic incentives .  
Agenda 21 and the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development established a comprehensive global approach to the achievement of sustainable development , recognizing the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and the importance of international cooperation . 
External assistance for the building of requisite infrastructure and national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
Therefore , at both the national and international levels , further work should be undertaken on the design of appropriate policies for attracting private foreign capital , in particular foreign direct investment ( FDI ) , reducing its volatility , and enhancing its contribution to sustainable development , for example by promoting innovative schemes , such as co-financing and " green " credit lines and investment funds .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly at the primary and secondary levels , including lifelong education , accessible to all , that augments both human capacity and well-being . 
Given the increasing number of decision-making bodies concerned with the various aspects of sustainable development , including international conventions , there is an ever greater need for better policy coordination at the intergovernmental level to ensure consistent and coherent positions of Governments in such processes , as well as enhanced collaboration among their secretariats . 
Appropriate and effective arrangements should be established in order to better support regional and subregional organizations , including the regional commissions , bearing in mind the role that such bodies play in the achievement of the sustainable development objectives agreed at the international level .  
The role of UNEP and its Governing Council , as the principal United Nations body in the field of environment , should be further enhanced , in conformity with the Nairobi Declaration on the Role and Mandate of UNEP , 20 with a view to enabling UNEP to serve as the leading environmental authority that sets the global environmental agenda , promotes the coherent implementation of the environmental dimension of sustainable development within the United Nations system , and acts as an authoritative advocate for the global environment .  
Negotiations for the replenishment of GEF will have special importance for its future work , as well as a direct impact on the availability of new and additional grant and concessional funding for sustainable development with global benefits at the global , regional and national levels .  
All responsible actors are requested to adopt a holistic , coordinated and collaborative approach to integrating a gender perspective into sustainable development , between governmental ministries and departments , and at the international level , between United Nations agencies , funds and bodies and other international entities .  
Multilateral and bilateral donors , Governments and the private sector should increase support to non-governmental organizations , particularly to women 's organizations , in playing an active role in advocacy for the implementation of Agenda 21 at the international and national levels , particularly in supporting national policies and programmes for sustainable development in the developing countries .  
All relevant actors should be encouraged to work in partnership with adolescent girls and boys , utilizing both formal and non-formal educational training activities , inter alia , through sustainable consumption patterns and responsible use of natural resources .  
But if the assumption is that the existing level of funding is unlikely to be increased in the years ahead , then the current system is simply not sustainable and we will witness a steady diminution in the support available to each treaty body and in the ability of each to function in a meaningful way .  
Recognizing that current global mapping efforts are primarily driven by global change concerns , future progress must also be responsive to more immediate national priorities that enhance economic growth and ensure sustainable development .  
The Framework contained a set of practical targets to be achieved by the year 2000 : comprehensive national assessments of risks from natural hazards , with these assessments taken into account in planning for sustainable development ; mitigation plans at national and / or local levels , involving long-term prevention , preparedness and community awareness ; and ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems and broad dissemination of warnings .  
Calls upon the Government of Guatemala , URNG and Guatemalan society as a whole to make every possible effort to familiarize the Guatemalan people with the content of the Peace agreements as quickly as possible , to ensure the full participation of the people in building the new multi _ ethnic , multicultural and multilingual nation , establishing a democratic society with social justice , initiating a period of sustained and sustainable economic and social development and ensuring the pre _ eminence of civilian authority in national decision _ making ;  
Stressing the link between peace and development , noting that significant international assistance is indispensable for sustainable development in Haiti , and stressing that a sustained commitment by the international community and the international financial institutions to assist and support the economic , social and institutional development in Haiti is indispensable for long-term peace and security in the country ,  
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in one 's country viable for all people ; to that end , efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
The new emphasis was also prompted by the IMF Executive Boards request that staff pay particular attention to social indicators in the contexts of adjustment programmes supported by the IMFs enhanced structural adjustment facility and of the initiative to help heavily indebted poor countries achieve sustainable external debt positions . 
Invites the Commission on Sustainable Development , the United Nations Environment Programme and other relevant United Nations bodies , funds and programmes , and the World Tourism Organization , to urgently develop strategies with existing national , regional and subregional tourism organizations in small island developing States to further facilitate sustainable tourism development as an essential element towards an action-oriented international programme of work on sustainable tourism ;  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote [ sustained economic growth and sustainable development ] ,  
Deeply concerned by the continued loss of the world 's biological diversity and , on the basis of the provisions of the Convention , reaffirming the commitment to the conservation of biological diversity , the sustainable use of its components , and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources ,  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations , in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment between interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and recalls the outcome of the Oslo meeting which reaffirmed that promoting access for all basic social services was essential for sustainable development and should be an integral part of any strategy to overcome poverty ;  
In the interests of equity , binding commitments for non-Annex I Parties could not even be envisaged until agreement had been reached on a fair system of apportionment of emission limits , a globally agreed reduction pathway and a projected sustainable future emission level on an equitable basis , and until there was reliable and predictable financial provision for the acquisition and adaptation of sound technologies , know-how and production systems in developing countries .  
Such a strategy should be based on three principles : developed countries should take the lead now in committing themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 level ; developing countries should also take actions to address climate change problems in promoting their sustainable development , taking into account their common but differentiated responsibilities under the Convention and their respective capabilities ; and developed countries should strengthen their partnership with developing countries through the provision of financial and technological support for mitigating global greenhouse gas emissions .  
Reaffirms that external cooperation plays an important role in the consolidation of the peace process , the strengthening of democracy and sustainable development in El Salvador , and consequently appeals to the international community , particularly to the relevant organs of the United Nations system , the international financial organizations , and donor countries , which have contributed so much to the profound changes achieved in El Salvador , to continue to provide political , technical and financial support for achieving the goals , aspirations and needs of the Salvadoran nation ;  
Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth and the necessity for a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to , inter alia , terms of trade , commodity prices , improved market access , trade practices , access to technology , exchange rates and international interest rates , and noting the continued need for resources for the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries ,  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
The main activities of the Observer Mission , in addition to the completion of the remaining military tasks , would focus on political , police and human rights aspects , as well as on humanitarian and public information programmes aimed at supporting and consolidating the national reconciliation process , with a view to creating conditions conducive to political stability , economic and social recovery and sustainable development . 
In the light of the international community 's increasing awareness of slow economic growth in many developing countries and countries in transition from a centrally planned economy to a free-market economy ( transitional economy countries ) and of the related negative global implications , it is essential that the United Nations should promote and implement action-oriented responses aimed at helping those countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable economic growth . 
The most effective means of reducing poverty is the adoption of national development strategies , including sound macroeconomic and structural policies , which encourage sustainable growth that increases income-earning opportunities for the poor and develop the human resources of the poor , particularly through broad access to education , health and family planning services .  
Despite the encouraging trend in the international flow of foreign direct investment , net resource flows , particularly to low-income countries and severely indebted lower-middle-income countries , have remained stagnant or declined , highlighting the need for the international community to continue mobilizing adequate financing in support of developing countries ' efforts to move towards external viability combined with sustainable growth .  
There are a number of situations in which partnership between public and private sector institutions is the most efficient and effective mechanism , due to the presence of mutually reinforcing goals - which in the final analysis converge towards an equitable and sustainable economic development of the country - and to the complementarity of capacities and roles .  
The agreed conclusions adopted on women and the environment focused on mainstreaming a gender perspective , translating it into concrete actions and moving beyond the concept of women as a major group . 4 For example , all actors at the international level were requested to adopt a holistic , coordinated and collaborative approach to integrate a gender perspective into sustainable development and to apply a gender perspective in all funding programmes for sustainable development , while acknowledging the importance of continuing programming targeted at women . 
Support is also increasingly requested in a wide range of new areas , such as infrastructure development , reinforcement of national capacities for research and development , environmental regeneration and sustainable development , capacity-building to increase competitiveness in the global economic environment , support in national reconstruction , the continuum of relief and development , public administration reform , disaster management , drug control , human rights and support for institutional reforms .  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
Many lack the capacity to articulate a long-term vision , an integrated policy framework and coherent programming or lack the capacity for policy reconciliation between sustained economic growth and sustainable development or between structural adjustment and social stability .  
Many developing countries , particularly the low-income and least developed ones , are weak in designing policy packages that would enable them to use international trade as an effective tool of sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
For sustained economic growth and sustainable development , a critical mass is necessary not only in physical infrastructure but also in an educated and skilled workforce .  
Fostering an enabling environment for development implies a concerted effort by Governments at the national and international levels , in collaboration with other actors in development , to ensure that the interplay among those policies , measures and institutions and the sum total of their impact promotes not only sustained economic growth but a development style that is sustainable and broad-based and whose benefits are shared equitably by all members of society .  
First and foremost , reinforcing peaceful conditions , a stable political framework , full respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , and effective participation by civil society are indispensable foundations for sustainable development .  
Investment ( domestic and foreign ) , capital inflows and access to foreign exchange are facilitated by a low and predictable rate of inflation , a sustainable fiscal deficit and a realistic exchange rate .  
The promotion of joint programming at the regional and subregional levels , leading to a more integrated approach that incorporates the social and economic dimensions of sustainable development , also needs to be encouraged .  
As planned , the Task Force produced a synthesis report for use by the resident coordinator system , summarizing lessons of experience at the country level and across countries with a view to suggesting ways of improving inter-agency collaboration in the future and providing a clear understanding of the different ingredients that work for the promotion of employment and sustainable livelihoods in specific situations and of the necessary indicators for monitoring progress in these areas .  
Achieving continued economic growth of the type that made good use of the assets that the poor own , i.e . labour , investing in human capital , removing distortions that discriminate against the poor and the unemployed , and targeting interventions towards the vulnerable and the extremely poor were found to be the proven ways of promoting employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people centred sustainable development .  
Although there is no universal prescription for successful development , a consensus has emerged , inter alia , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development , which is the framework of our efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people .  
In order to foster a supportive international environment for development , countries should pursue economic stability , full employment , a low rate of inflation , sustainable external and internal balances , including the avoidance of excessive budget deficits , low long-term real interest rates and a measure of exchange rate stability .  
National plans of action and / or other relevant national programmes and actions to achieve the goals of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development will need to be developed or strengthened , where appropriate , and their implementation will need to be monitored and evaluated by governments in close cooperation with their partners in development at the national level .  
The existing resources available to developing countries - public , private , multilateral , bilateral , domestic , and external - need to be enhanced through appropriate and flexible mechanisms and economic instruments to support adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development .  
For developing countries , particularly the least developed countries , ODA is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and implementation of Agenda 21 is required .  
From these conferences , a consensus has emerged on a multidimensional , comprehensive and integrated approach to development which recognizes , among others , that economic development , social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development .  
More generally , ACC members called for complementary actions by the United Nations system , in close partnership with other actors , to support country-level efforts at relief , rehabilitation , reconstruction and development , and agreed upon the broad elements of a common strategic framework for response to , and recovery from , crisis , as part of the system 's overall effort to help secure durable peace and pursue or restore sustainable development in countries in crisis situations .  
In addition to a separate subprogramme for the least developed , landlocked and island developing countries , the Special Body on Least Developed and Landlocked Developing Countries and the Special Body on Pacific Island Developing Countries of ESCAP also carry out five other subprogrammes dealing with regional economic cooperation , environment and sustainable development , poverty alleviation and social integration , transport , communications and tourism development and statistics .  Recommendation 2 .  
In addition , recognizing the imperative of a conducive policy environment for participation of resource users in conservation and sustainable management of natural resources , the Fund has launched a comprehensive programme of studies to examine pertinent policy and institutional issues at the national and local levels .  
The Habitat Agenda offered a positive vision of sustainable human settlements in which everyone had adequate shelter , a healthy and safe environment , basic services and productive and freely chosen employment .  
In the twenty-first century , megalopolises and cities of all sizes would become the main centres of efforts to achieve sustainable economic , social and environmental development and , at the same time , hubs of world trade and national and global partnership in the areas of industrial and scientific and technological cooperation .  
The international community , by redirecting its focus to sustainable development , would be able to overcome the false dichotomy between economic , social and environmental measures and instead view such measures as integral parts of a single whole .  
The Agenda then tied poverty eradication to the objective agreed at the social development summit , namely " enabling all women and men to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen and productive employment and work " .  
It is important that national and international environmental and social policies be implemented and strengthened in order to ensure that globalization trends have a positive impact on sustainable development , especially in developing countries .  
There has been a sizeable expansion of private flows of financial resources from developed to a limited number of developing countries and , in a number of countries , efforts have been made in support of domestic resource mobilization , including the increasing use of economic instruments to promote sustainable development .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance in all sectors of society , as well as effective participation by civil society , are also an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development .  
The gap between developed and developing countries points to the continued need for a dynamic and enabling international economic environment supportive of international cooperation , particularly in the fields of finance , technology transfer , debt and trade , if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased .  
All countries should strive to promote sustainable consumption patterns ; developed countries should take the lead in achieving sustainable consumption patterns ; developing countries should seek to achieve sustainable consumption patterns in their development process , guaranteeing the provision of basic needs for the poor , while avoiding those unsustainable patterns , particularly in industrialized countries , generally recognized as unduly hazardous to the environment , inefficient and wasteful , in their development processes .  
There is a need for concerted action by all countries and for improved cooperation to assist developing countries in implementing the relevant agreements and instruments in order that they may participate effectively in the sustainable use , conservation and management of their fishery resources , as provided for in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and other international legal instruments , and achieve integrated coastal zone management . 
To maintain the momentum generated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Forests process and to facilitate and encourage the holistic , integrated and balanced intergovernmental policy dialogue on all types of forests in the future , which continues to be an open , transparent and participatory process , requires a long-term political commitment to sustainable forest management worldwide .  
Noting the vital role of energy in the continuation of sustained economic growth , especially for developing countries , be they importers or suppliers of energy , and recognizing the complexities and interdependencies inherent in addressing energy issues within the context of sustainable development , preparations for this session should be initiated at the seventh session and should utilize an open-ended intergovernmental group of experts on energy and sustainable development to be held in conjunction with inter-sessional meetings of the eighth and ninth sessions of the Commission .  
The transfer to developing countries of environmentally sound , economically viable and socially acceptable technologies relevant to combating desertification and / or mitigating the effects of drought , with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected areas , should be undertaken without delay on mutually agreed terms .  
The expected growth in the tourism sector and the increasing reliance of many developing countries , including small island developing States , on this sector as a major employer and contributor to local , national , subregional and regional economies highlights the need to pay special attention to the relationship between environmental conservation and protection and sustainable tourism .  
External assistance for building the requisite infrastructure and for national capacity-building , including human and institutional capacity , and for facilitating access to information on sustainable development practices and the transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in accordance with paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 , is crucial for small island developing States to effectively attain the goals of the Programme of Action .  
A fundamental prerequisite for sustainable development is an adequately financed and effective educational system at all levels , particularly the primary and secondary levels , that is accessible to all and that augments both human capacity and well-being .  
The Commission 's work programme on indicators of sustainable development should result in a practicable and agreed set of indicators , suited to country-specific conditions , including a limited number of aggregated indicators , to be used at the national level , on a voluntary basis , by the year 2000 . 
National reports on the implementation of Agenda 21 have proved to be a valuable means of sharing information at the international and regional levels and , even more important , of providing a focus for the coordination of issues related to sustainable development at the national level within individual countries .  
The emphasis that the African common position placed on poverty reduction as one of its main strategic objectives was intended to let solidarity play its role as a driving force in a sustainable development that would combine environmental preservation with the rational use of the planet \ x { e5b8 } limited resources .  
Greater Johannesburg has been very successful in aligning its local Agenda 21 with its development processes , which has in turn been institutionalized within the legal framework , and it has organized sustainable urban environmental management by integrating it into the overall functioning of local government .  
Aware and convinced that the survival of humanity is a collective responsibility , we decided in Rio to establish a new kind of partnership built of common yet differentiated responsibility in order to promote national , regional and world cooperation for development that we wished to be sustainable .  
Thus , Cameroon , for its part , has worked to develop internal legal provisions and appropriate structures , including , in particular , a law on the forest and animal regime ; the institutionalization and organization of educational seminars on environmental problems ; the creation of a national advisory commission for environment and sustainable development ; and the development of a national plan of action for environmental management .  
The sustainable management of natural resources , the combatting of pollution and environmental degradation , the development of human resources through the implementation of a population policy , education and health , regional integration , the creation of productive jobs in rural areas and through the development of the private sector in order to eradicate poverty all these represent the strategic framework which will make it possible to ensure human sustainable development in our country .  
Therefore , Member States , the developed nations in particular , international development organizations and the private sector must fulfil the commitments they undertook in Rio , especially in terms of the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the provision of financial and technical resources , with a view to creating an equitable , fair and just international economic and social environment that would ensure the incorporation of the efforts of the developing countries into the implementation of the overall strategies of sustainable development and environmental protection .  
Unfortunately and I repeat , unfortunately the persistent reluctance of the countries of the North to respect their commitments to the developing countries by granting additional financial resources , increasing public development aid to 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and transferring eco-technologies under favourable conditions , is considerably restricting the capacity of these countries to meet the requirements of sustainable development . 
We also salute the many non-governmental organizations in the fields of development and environment , the environmental journalists , the public servants in local authorities , the planners at the national level and the precious few political leaders and diplomats at the international level who in their own way have stuck out their necks on behalf of sustainable development . 
The Commission on Human Settlements , in its resolution 16 / 24 of 7 May 1997 entitled " Special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21 " , reaffirmed that sustainable development was essential for human settlements development and expressed the conviction that urban settlements , properly planned and managed , held a promise for human development and for the protection of the world 's natural resources through their ability to support large numbers of people while limiting their negative impact on the natural environment .  
Also in resolution 16 / 24 , the Commission called upon the General Assembly to take into account , at its special session , the Habitat Agenda and the Istanbul Declaration , because urgent action in cities and human settlements was necessary to secure sustainable human settlements and safe and healthy living conditions , especially for urban populations .  That was in recognition of the impact of urbanization on all sectors of sustainable human settlements .  
Moreover , the countless emerging transnational issues , such as environmental protection , sustainable development , non-proliferation of nuclear weapons , prevention of drug trafficking and abuse , overpopulation in cities , payment of debts , eradication of poverty and protection of intellectual property rights , need to be addressed from a global perspective .  
From a sustainable development perspective , the two principal concerns of developing countries with regard to foreign direct investment ( FDI ) are ( a ) attracting FDI as a source of long-term capital , and ( b ) enhancing the role of FDI in advancing social and environmental objectives .  
This section analyses provisions on financial transfers and mechanisms in recent MEAs ( in particular provisions on " compliance assistance " contained in the Montreal Protocol , the CBD and the FCCC ) , as well as other ways of generating new public and private financial resources to assist developing countries in promoting sustainable development and more particularly in tackling global environmental problems .  
Clear examples and opportunities exist for providing benefits to source countries as well as indigenous and local communities in terms of health improvement , resource management capacity , and sustainable use of natural resources .  The key to its success will be in the ability to provide near - and long-term benefits that effect changes in the behaviour of individuals , communities and private companies , as well as in natural resource policies of both developed and developing country governments .  
The integration of women into the management of public affairs was therefore not only part of an economic policy strategy aimed at achieving integrated and sustainable development but was also consistent with a coherent and global perspective on human rights .  
Moreover , although UNDCP had assisted many Governments in drafting drug control laws , it remained to be seen whether those same Governments had provided the resources required to implement drug control programmes in an effective and sustainable manner and whether policies addressed drug abuse and illicit traffic in a balanced fashion , as the General Assembly had requested .  
Recognizing also that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , and fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements ,  
His delegation looked forward to the special session of the General Assembly for the review of Agenda 21 , which it hoped would provide policy guidelines in the critical areas of sustainable development and adopt measures to achieve sustainable development goals , in particular through the provision of adequate financial resources , the transfer of environmentally sound technology and the creation of institutional mechanisms . 
As established in Agenda 21 , the global partnership for sustainable development must be based on the transfer of new and additional resources to developing countries to meet their immense needs and enable them to achieve sustainable development .  
For example , the indicators of sustainable development , the impact of economic globalization on the global natural environment , the relationship between sustainable development and sustained economic growth and the monitoring of natural processes at the global level could be addressed under a separate item .  
The Programme believed that the international capital markets and the private sector played a vital role in the promotion of sustainable energy concepts , since total private sector investments in energy far outweighed all flows of official development assistance to the sector .  
The purpose of the special session should not be to renegotiate Agenda 21 or to redefine the principles and objectives of sustainable development , but rather to identify priority sectoral issues that required follow-up at the international level .  The outcomes of other United Nations conferences held since the Rio Conference should also be taken into account in order to avoid duplication of ongoing work or work which had already been implemented in other international forums .  
Human settlements played an essential role in sustainable development and must be an integral component of policies and programmes developed at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
The notion of sustainable human settlements must therefore be integrated more systematically both at the national level and within the United Nations system ; a dialogue must be established between civil society and its representatives , and cooperation among local Governments that had to resolve similar problems and between the various levels of government must be strengthened .  
That would be a fitting occasion for the submission of concrete proposals for ensuring that the new models of international cooperation would be translated effectively into reality , enabling sustained economic growth and sustainable development in all countries , in particular the developing countries .  
The European Union had consistently emphasized its strong conviction that the Organization was uniquely well placed to advance international cooperation in the economic and social fields and to foster further progress towards the essential objective of international sustainable development .  Accordingly , the European Union was firmly committed to the multilateral approach to global problems ; it renewed its commitment to the United Nations and was prepared to equip it for the tasks of a new century .  
Second , the new global partnership must place economic cooperation for development at the centre of its attention ; although the global conferences of recent years had reached consensus about sustainable development , affirming that socio-economic development and environmental protection were complementary , it should not be forgotten that economic growth would always be the foundation and engine of sustainable development and , therefore , that efforts to help developing countries achieve sustained economic growth should be the core objective of international cooperation for development .  
Bolivia had participated actively in organizing a meeting of the Latin American countries at the level of Head of State and Government to be held in Santa Cruz de la Sierra , Bolivia , in December , at which the thrust of national and international actions for sustainable development would be defined , including economic , social and environmental goals , and the importance of obtaining new and additional resources for the financing of the plan of action to be adopted would be reaffirmed .  
While the Group of Seven recognized the crucial role played by the United Nations in organizing international cooperation for sustainable development and fostering consensus on development policies and goals , that recognition , though encouraging , would best be expressed through attainment of the agreed ODA targets and implementation of existing agreements and commitments .  
Up to 40 missions to Governments of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , at their request and in cooperation with United Nations agencies and regional commissions , related to formulation of strategies that promote sustainable development , including financing of sustainable development , use of economic instruments and building relevant institutional capacities , including for monitoring and assessment , as well as related to the management of mineral , water and energy resources ; ( ii ) Training . 
The agenda for development , the first draft of which had been taken up by the General Assembly at its forty-seventh session , therefore demonstrated the desire of the international community to lay down rules at the global level for promoting sustainable and comprehensive development based on shared responsibilities .  
Three basic principles were embodied in the agenda : the multidimensional nature of the development process , encompassing such elements as sustainable economic growth , social justice , good governance and respect for human rights , including equal rights for women ; the need for an integrated approach at both the national and the international level , while ensuring their concomitance ; and the responsibility of each agent of development , giving priority to national action .  
She stressed the urgent need for the international community and the multilateral financial institutions to formulate strategies that would significantly reduce the debt stock to a sustainable or manageable level that would not impede the implementation of development programmes or deter investors .  
As the Council underlined , the essential prerequisite for the successful completion of peaceful reintegration is the full cooperation of the Government of Croatia , which bears the ultimate responsibility for convincing the local population that their reintegration is sustainable and that the process of reconciliation and return is irreversible .  
Leaders thanked the Prime Minister of the Cook Islands for his presentation on the Forum theme of reform , human values and togetherness and discussed how reforms aimed at achieving sustainable development should go beyond conventional economic dimensions to embrace the essentially holistic nature of the process , and took cognizance of the need for Pacific cultural values and norms to be the basic premise and foundation of this process and the work of regional institutions .  
Promote and co-operate in providing the necessary financial and technological resources for the sustainable management , conservation and enhancement , as appropriate , of sinks and reservoirs of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol , including biomass , forests and oceans as well as other terrestrial , coastal and marine ecosystems .  
Its purpose is above all to alert the public and world leaders to the role of the oceans in planetary survival , to the threats facing the oceans and to more peaceful and sustainable use of the oceans , as well as to suggest ways of strengthening the legal and institutional framework for ocean governance at the national , regional and global levels .  
With respect to economic concerns , the Commission is looking at how far contemporary economic theory can be applied to ocean management in the context of sustainable development , at the national , regional and global levels and is assessing the effectiveness of alternative policy instruments in improving the way humans treat the oceans .  
For module two , covering supply reduction , the main focus areas are : adoption of a balanced and integrated approach to drug control ; development activities aimed at structural factors ; coordinated subregional efforts based on similar legislation ; crop replacement efforts including promotion of sustainable agriculture ; reliable data for measuring opium poppy cultivation ; political support by Governments ; capacity-building and human resources development ; and collection of information on experiences in alternative development .  
A sustainable improvement in export performance requires not only productivity growth based on rising investment rates , but also policies that ensure that real wages do not increase faster than productivity growth , and that the exchange rate is maintained at a stable and competitive level .  
We equally recognize that sustainable development in coastal areas is dependent upon an adequate understanding of the interaction between natural assets and social and human capital .  
Without continued efforts at international cooperation , smaller countries and developing countries may never build up an adequate scientific and educational base for sustainable space technology and application programmes .  
At the World Summit , the international community acknowledged that the equal rights of girls and the equal participation of women in the social , cultural , economic and political life of societies is a prerequisite for successful and sustainable development .  
Given the demographic , economic and geographic constraints , small island developing States should consider a well educated , highly adaptable and environmentally conscious population and workforce as a central pillar of national sustainable development .  
Although industry is a major user of natural resources and a direct or indirect source of pollution and other environmental impacts , business and industry must remain a key partner in the common endeavour to achieve sustainable development .  
The effects of natural disasters and bad weather on agricultural production notwithstanding , hunger and the lack of sustainable agricultural development were not solely the result of chance but rather of human choices and poor decisions .  
Those that have not established such a body should take immediate action to ensure that a national mechanism for guiding and coordinating sustainable development policy be put in place and be given adequate status and resources for effective functioning .  
Chouinard ( Canada ) said that , with the year 2000 fast approaching , sustainable development continued to be the most vital issue facing mankind ; it required a concerted and long-term commitment from the international community . 
Despite considerable efforts , many developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , do not yet possess a critical mass of trained personnel in specialized fields and in interdisciplinary approaches related to sustainable development .  
Those that have not established such a body should take immediate action to ensure that a national mechanism for guiding and coordinating sustainable development policy be put in place and given adequate status and resources for effective functioning .  
Given demographic , economic and geographic constraints , small island developing States should consider a well educated , highly adaptable and environmentally conscious population and workforce to be a central pillar of national sustainable development .  
Zimbabwe was endeavouring to achieve effective economic management , guided by policies aimed at generating sustainable growth , as a basis for improving the living conditions of the people , while continuing to address social inequalities and gender issues .  
Thus , solidarity was the precondition for a lasting solution to all crises political , economic and environmental that threatened international peace and stability and undermined the chances for genuine and sustainable development for all .  
Only effective and increased international cooperation could save developing nations from a deeper crisis and generate sustainable development , thereby enabling them to be true participants in the global partnership for development .  
The United Nations had a key role to play in the effective coordination and promotion of multilateral efforts and in the collective examination of lessons learned by countries which had applied the sustainable development model .  
The second stage would focus on major structural transformations of the national economy by promoting domestic production , thereby creating further opportunities for private business and favourable conditions for sustainable economic growth .  
This ongoing work programme has developed a working list of indicators of sustainable development , divided into four categories social , economic , environmental and institutional .  
Reaffirming the need to incorporate sustainable development strategies , since they are essential to achieving economic , social , and environmental goals in a balanced and complementary manner ,  
The devastating social , economic and environmental impact of anti-personnel mines and their detrimental effects on the creation of conditions conducive to sustainable development is well documented .  
The supremacy of law is a vital element in the containment of conflicts and the protection of civil , cultural , social , political and economic rights ; but it is also a prerequisite for sustainable development and stability .  
It was convinced that the adoption of appropriate economic policies and the committed participation of the industrialized countries and international financial institutions would make it possible to meet the challenges of sustainable development .  
They support exchanges and cooperation , including joint projects , in basic and applied scientific research as well as in areas of research and development with potential for the development of modern society and sustainable economic growth in the future .  
The transformation from emergency reconstruction to sustainable longer-term development also assumes continued political and economic stability , which provides a necessary , but not sufficient , basis for rapid growth , a key national objective .  
Thirdly , rather than providing temporary services for the poor , the main objective of IFAD is to develop viable and financially sustainable rural financial systems , especially for the very poor living in remote areas in many developing countries .  
The broad-based concept of partnership with all actors in civil society has been widely recognized as a key feature of the Habitat Agenda and for making human settlements sustainable in ecological , social and economic terms .  
The Inter-Parliamentary Union continued to provide strong and concrete support to the major international conferences or summit conferences organized by the United Nations to address issues relating to sustainable economic and social development .  
It adopted the Istanbul Declaration , in which the nations present endorsed the universal goals of ensuring adequate shelter for all and making human settlements safer , healthier and more liveable , equitable , sustainable and productive .  
The major cost required for the rental of transmission and distribution facilities ( $ 5,948,000 per biennium ) is a recurring cost calculated at commercial prices and as such is not sustainable within existing resources .  
It should be designed to meet critical urgent needs , as well as the long-term requirements essential for the development of a sustainable national / local capacity , when applicable .  
Before the crisis , economic orthodoxy had held that a current account deficit was acceptable and sustainable if it stemmed from investment as opposed to consumption and if it was a result of private sector activities .  
Most of the heavily indebted poor countries were in Africa , and the present reality was that increasing debt , combined with economic stagnation , proved that 10 years of structural adjustments were not sufficient to pave the way to sustainable economic growth .  
At the policy level , there is a lack of properly articulated policies on sustainable development , and very little or no integration of environmental dimensions in socio-economic policy planning at the national level , which makes it difficult to harmonize priorities at the regional and subregional levels , and to develop coherent and subregional programmes .  
Since sectoral approaches to coastal development have not proven effective in arresting its deterioration , the concept of integrated coastal area management ( ICAM ) has gained recognition in recent years as a comprehensive , ecosystem-based approach to sustainable development and environmental conservation .  
The Coastal Module Panel of GOOS has begun the design of optimal monitoring and forecasting systems for coastal seas , focusing on preserving healthy coastal environments , promoting sustainable use of resources , mitigating coastal hazards , and enabling safe and efficient marine operations .  
The development process requires a united vision if it is to be sustainable , and it requires joint responsibility on the part of the public and the private sectors to ensure continuity combined with the political stability that strengthens democratic governance .  
Energy plays a key role in achieving the economic , social and environmental objective of sustainable development , and the supply of energy must be secure and reliable .  
Firmly convinced of the environmental , economic , social and cultural importance of all types of forests , Liechtenstein supports all efforts aimed at establishing an international , legally binding , comprehensive and coherent instrument on sustainable forest management .  
Bangladesh has enacted laws for the protection of environment and set up Green Courts to handle violation of these laws , formulated the National Environment Management Action Plan , ratified almost all major international conventions , and established a national coordination mechanism for sustainable development a National Environmental Committee headed by the Prime Minister .  
In other words , it aimed at finding ways and means to strike a true balance between present and future economic , social and ecological needs on the one hand , and laying the foundations for a world partnership based on shared understanding of needs and interests with a view to attaining sustainable development on the other .  
We are particularly concerned that poverty continues unabated ; financial resources have taken a downturn ; the transfer of environmental technologies has not materialized ; human-induced climate change has increased ; trade and investments have become more difficult for developing countries ; and globalization has unleashed new threats to sustainable development .  
New and additional resources and environmentally sound technology were identified as the critical inputs for arresting worldwide environmental degradation and achieving sustained economic growth and the sustainable development of humankind .  
My country also highlighted the great importance of fostering sustainable development , whose objective is to harmonize human activities and nature by means of policies and actions that will achieve an efficient and fair economy , a just society and the preservation of the environment , in order to ensure a better quality of life for present and future generations in a safe environment .  
Reaffirming that the full implementation of the Platform for Action requires immediate and concerted action by all to create a peaceful , just and humane world based on all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the principle of equality for all people of all ages and from all walks of life , and , to that end , recognizing that broad-based and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development is necessary to sustain social development and social justice ,  
Ghana was convinced that sustainable development held the key to global peace , and therefore appreciated the Departments focus of raising the profile of the African continent in the media .  
IFF may wish to consider the success of CGIAR in mobilizing resources and achieving coherence for international efforts to address a shared global agenda in the field of agriculture and food security and to examine the potential of extending that model to address forest research to ensure sustainable forest management and to maintain adequate cover of all types of forest and other wooded lands to meet a variety of current and future human needs .  
To be most effective in achieving sustainable forest management , economic instruments should be designed with a specific policy objective in mind ; they should also be well integrated into the broader macroeconomic and multisectoral policy context .  
Success in using this tool to promote improved forest management will depend on the existence of mutually supportive and effective management institutions ; the political will to implement appropriate policies ( including regulation ) ; and physical parameters , such as the level of sustainable harvest and cost of production .  
Progress in achieving sustainable forest management will depend on effective integration and coordination of local , national , regional and international actions related to these topics in addition to main economic instruments , such as direct economic incentives ( subsidies and charges ) , tax policies , resource rent capture and regulation of land tenure .  
Additional information is needed on approaches that can be used to devise markets for forest products , and the role of the public and private sector in assuring that new or expanded markets are consistent with the social , economic and ecological components of sustainable forest management .  
Local , national and international policies must reflect an accurate understanding of the factors affecting demands on forests , and must reflect consistent , mutually supportive approaches to ensuring that efforts to meet these demands are consistent with sustainable forest management .  
However , there is currently no formal mechanism , at either the global or the regional level , to undertake a composite review of the compliance of forest-related obligations of existing instruments in a cohesive and comprehensive manner , and to assess their collective effectiveness in achieving sustainable forest management .  
This relates to the complex question of international and national transfers to internalize positive externalities by supporting forest-based sustainable livelihoods of the rural poor .  
Whatever the outcome on public funding arrangements , the essential role of the private sector in the productive , entrepreneurial aspects of sustainable forest management needs to be recognized , reinforced and promoted .  
There was a growing realization that business was not only about wealth creation but also about assuming social responsibilities for issues such as humans rights and sustainable human development , and that globalization and trade liberalization had had some unforeseen negative effects , including financial instability .  
With the increasing recognition of the importance of good governance , those instruments provide a foundation for promoting and maintaining the rule of law , a basic requisite for sustainable socio-economic development ; furnish a basis for Governments to assess their systems , formulate legislation and develop effective tools for controlling national and transnational forms of crime ; and provide a framework for technical assistance , which in turn serves as a catalyst for their implementation .  
Generally speaking , however , the current extent and types of protected areas , particularly in densely populated regions , are deemed insufficient to achieve sustainable forest management due to both internal and external factors .  
Encourage countries , with support from international organizations , to develop and implement polices which adequately value non-market forest benefits in economic terms ; recognize the real social and economic values of forest environmental services ; recognize native forests as a capital resource and invest accordingly in preventing their depletion ; seek to maintain overall biological diversity ; and ensure that harvests do not exceed ecologically sustainable levels ;  
The Panel recognized that the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits derived from research and development and from the commercial utilization of biological resources fell , inter alia , within the purview of the Convention .  
The Convention established , early on , a process to ensure that knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity were considered in all relevant sectoral and thematic areas in the implementation of the Convention .  
The principle of prior informed consent is also embedded in the wording of article 8 ( j ) , whereby , subject to national legislation , the wider application of the knowledge , innovations and practices of indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity should only occur with the approval and involvement of the holders of such knowledge , innovations and practices . 
But implementation of these policies will have little impact on long _ term sustainable development , sound management of natural resources , or on the reduction of poverty and inequality unless accompanied by fundamental transformation of unjust economic and political structures both at national and global levels .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society , are an essential part of the foundations necessary for the realization of social and people-centred sustainable development ;  
It made it more difficult for developing countries to make use of their traditional comparative advantages , such as cheap labour and abundant natural resources , since industrial and technological capacity with a solid infrastructural base , adequate human resources and business development were increasingly determinants of economic growth and sustainable development .  
A sustainable industrial policy was a crucial component of development strategies , which included a number of key objectives : open competitive economies , progressive trade liberalization , secure and productive employment , social development and environmental protection .  
The purpose of the OHCHR technical cooperation programme is to assist countries - including Governments and civil society - in promoting and protecting all human rights at the national and regional levels , through the incorporation of international human rights standards in national laws , policies and practices , and building a sustainable national capacity to implement these standards and ensure respect for human rights .  
We welcome the newly established international legally binding norm on an APLs ban as a pivotal step towards a sustainable response to the global humanitarian crisis caused by their indiscriminate use in various parts of the world .  
While the developing countries had utilized their own resources in order to achieve the basic objective of sustainable development , it was clear that those efforts would be inadequate without substantial support from the international community .  
There was no point in speaking of sustainable development when some countries members of the Forum faced the prospect of being submerged by the sea in the not too distant future , and atolls were being polluted by nuclear tests .  
Following completion of the work of the three inter-agency task forces established by ACC ( on basic social services for all , an enabling environment for economic and social development , and full employment and sustainable livelihoods ) and with input from the Inter-Agency Committee for Women and Gender Equality , an inter-agency workshop held in Turin , Italy in December 1997 established country-level arrangements for follow-up to the global conferences and summits .  
Realizing the multiple benefits of the sustainable management of forests and other wooded lands will require cross-sectoral policy harmonization within a country , taking into account transboundary , regional and global dimensions , as well as the productive , environmental and social functions of forests .  
It has been argued that many complex and cross-sectoral aspects of productive , economic and social development , as well as environmental protection , intersect in forests , so that how forests are managed , conserved and developed can be seen as a reality check for sustainable development .  
This consensus recognizes the wide diversity of social , economic , environmental , cultural and political conditions around the world and accordingly the need to develop appropriate diverse approaches towards sustainable forest management .  
In its final report , IPF emphasized that national inventories are an important basis for effective formulation of national forest programmes , and that assessment of the actual and potential conditions of all types of forests is central to sustainable forest management and a wide range of other considerations related to forests and forest ecosystems at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
Discussions around financial resources in IPF and IFF have also included such issues as effective private sector involvement ; integration with national policies and priorities and effective coordination ; the application of economic instruments and tax policies ; the mobilization of national financial resources ; and the possibility of finding a mechanism to raise funds to establish a forest fund dedicated to support activities aimed at sustainable forest management .  
Shedding light on the above issues and focusing attention on the critical importance of building indigenous capacity and technological capabilities as indispensable inputs to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries was one of the objectives of the CSTD in convening the meeting of the Working Group .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
Feature formats will focus on peacekeeping , economic and social development , human rights , sustainable development , the advancement of women , the question of Palestine , environmental issues , international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , international drug trafficking , health , population and development , youth and issues of regional concern ( News and Media Division ) ; iv . 
Generally , small island developing States recognized the extremely vital and critical role of donor support in attaining the goals of the Programme of Action , and called on the international community not to judge their eligibility for concessional assistance solely by the indicator of per capita income , which ignores their fragility , vulnerability and inability to generate adequate national savings relative to the enormity of investment required for sustainable development .  
Along the same line , it was proposed that small island developing States need to adopt a programme approach instead of a project-by-project approach in sustainable development planning , and to mainstream projects and programmes into comprehensive integrated national sustainable development plans that incorporate the economic , social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
Donors called for the strengthening of small island developing States statistical capabilities so that they may develop suitable indicators of progress in sustainable development , in particular indicators for monitoring the performance of projects and programmes to ensure that external funding is effectively utilized and set targets are attained .  
The European Union recognized that external debt overhang remained a major obstacle to sustainable development in many poor developing countries and that solutions must continue to be sought to prevent the burden of debt service from offsetting the benefits of reforms in those countries and to ensure their access to financial markets .  
While promoting the uses of voluntary initiatives and agreements as positive instruments for sustainable development , trade unions will also promote the defining of minimum social , environmental and economic indicators that voluntary initiatives or agreements must never conflict with or undermine ( for example , minimum social indicators would include International Labour Organization ( ILO ) core labour standards , child and forced labour provisions , and employment equality requirements ) .  
While continuing to provide regional comparable statistics and indicators needed for assessing and monitoring progress achieved in sustainable development in the ESCWA region , during the biennium 20002001 , the subprogramme will concentrate on upgrading these services to better respond to the renewed and growing interest in statistics and indicators covering a wide range of economic , social and , for the first time , environmental concerns associated with sustainable development .  
Assistance to Governments in the development of coherent and effective legal regimes at the global , regional and national levels that address major environmental issues in the context of sustainable development ;  
They have been playing a major role in developing policy on economic integration and in clarifying economic , social , political and environmental issues relating to sustainable development .  
Two high-level regional seminars on the implementation of the PEDA model ; two seminars on the monitoring of the series of globally agreed upon programmes and conventions that flow from the New Agenda for Development of Africa in the 1990s ; two workshops on developing methodologies and guidelines on sustainable agricultural production systems and environmental rehabilitation programmes in Africa ; two seminars on topical issues on food security and sustainable development ;  
At its nineteenth special session , the General Assembly stated that while energy is essential to economic and social development and improved quality of life , sustainable patterns of production , distribution and use of energy are crucial . 
Furthermore , labour-intensive public works can be effective for creating employment and productive infrastructure not only in situations linked to war , natural disasters or economic emergencies but also in a variety of regular investment programmes which can provide sustainable employment to those working in agriculture or in the informal economy .  
Other related issues discussed included the need for Governments to place poverty eradication at the top of the national agenda ; the debt burden ; womens access to and control of productive assets , such as land and credit ; and enhancing the human capital of the poor by ensuring their access to basic health care , education , nutrition , productive employment and sustainable livelihoods .  
Four advisory missions each on macroeconomic policy and economic reform in countries with economies in transition ; policy responses to social impacts of the economic crisis ; institution-building for integrating environmental considerations into economic decision-making processes ; macroeconomic policy and related institution-building in least developed and Pacific island developing countries ; and promotion of sustainable development in small island developing States ; ( ii ) Group training .  
At the national level , this entails improving regulatory mechanisms and legislative frameworks , medium - and long-term integrated planning and strategy development , the use of economic instruments for sustainable consumption and production patterns and general awareness-raising and educational activities relating to sustainable development .  
Reiterates its invitation to States to promote a culture of peace based on the purposes and principles established in the Charter of the United Nations , respect for all human rights , democracy , education for peace , promotion of sustainable development , tolerance , respect for pluralism , positive acceptance of multiculturalism , the wider participation of women , and equal opportunities for all , as an integral approach to preventing violence in its diverse manifestations ;  
Technical and economic cooperation among developing countries ( TCDC / ECDC ) facilitated increased South-South sharing of capacities through the development and dissemination of 250 best practices in good governance , structural adjustment , poverty eradication , micro-financing , maternal mortality , agriculture and food security , science and technology for sustainable human development , job creation and management of the environment and the sustainable development of small island states . 
On fisheries and other marine living resources , participants stressed the crucial importance in much of the world of ensuring continuing sustainable supply of food from the oceans and seas ( a matter of particular moment for many communities in developing countries ) as well as the need to protect marine biological diversity .  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social - and people-centered sustainable development ;  
It was emphasized that a global framework and plan of action for sustainable tourism must be coupled with implementation and decision-making at the local level , as well as at the regional and national levels .  
Reiterates its invitation to States to promote a culture of peace based on the purposes and principles established in the Charter of the United Nations , respect for all human rights , democracy , education for peace , promotion of sustainable development , tolerance , respect for pluralism , positive acceptance of multiculturalism , the wider participation of women , and equal opportunities for all , as an integral approach to preventing violence in its diverse manifestations ;  
Democracy , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , including the right to development , transparent and accountable governance and administration in all sectors of society , and effective participation by civil society are an essential part of the necessary foundations for the realization of social - and people-centered sustainable development ;  
To develop environmentally , socially and culturally compatible forms of tourism and to continue the development and implementation of voluntary initiatives in support of sustainable tourism development , bearing in mind that such forms of tourism and initiatives should meet , or preferably exceed , relevant local , national , regional or international standards ;  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
To undertake a comprehensive survey and assessment of the results of implementing existing voluntary initiatives and guidelines relating to the economic , sociocultural and environmental sustainability of tourism , to be reported to the Commission on Sustainable Development in order to identify best practices with respect to raising awareness of sustainable tourism development ;  
Actions were elaborated to target , inter alia , strengthening coordination between national and local support strategies and institutions ; strengthening institutional capacities for supporting small and medium enterprises in key agro-industrial subsectors ; and improving national capacities in the sustainable management of natural resources , with emphasis on the conservation of biodiversity and exploitation of its business opportunities .  
There remains a need to reconcile the widely divergent views held over the exercise of political power and the strategies for social and economic development , in order for there to be favourable prospects for political stability and sustainable institutional and economic development .  
UNDP resident representatives have played a key role in telling the complex story of sustainable human development to help to increase understanding of what UNDP stands for and to generate support for the organization .  
The Circle brings together experts , scholars , researchers and professionals from diverse academic backgrounds and intellectual traditions united by a common endeavour : working towards promoting a holistic concept of sustainable development that takes into account all its profound and complex dimensions .  
A UNIDO policy firmly aligned with the broad United Nations global agenda of sustainable human development and poverty reduction through UNIDOs programmatic focus on the three Es of sustainable industrial development : competitive Economy , productive Employment , and sound Environment , at the policy , institutional and enterprise level ;  
It is now widely recognized that the implementation of sustainable development schemes will have to be based on original and innovative approaches to the development process , where sharing must be an integral part of the support given by the industrialized world .  
It must therefore be concluded that sustainable , culturally appropriate and sociologically stable development can only be brought about when the educational processes required for development lead to professional outlets for those whose motivation for learning and development has a broader meaning than arrival at an often locally defined socio-economic status .  
The Social Summits commitment 3 , contained in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development1 stated that the heads of State and Government committed themselves to promoting the goal of full employment as a basic priority of our economic and social policies , and to enabling all men and women to attain secure and sustainable livelihoods through freely chosen productive employment and work .  
It is essential that this future body , whose governing board will comprise the various sectors of civil society involved and whose role will be of key importance in developing space sciences within the country and in familiarizing coming generations with the issues of sustainable socio-economic development , should be strengthened as from its establishment through the cooperation of Member States .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Promoting community development , improving access to security of land tenure , housing and basic services , and fully integrating people living in poverty into economic , social and political life , which are crucial to sustainable development ;  
Emphasizes the role of the international community and external assistance to developing countries and countries with economies in transition in improving the quality of information on the impact of urbanization on all aspects of sustainable development , in sharing of information on the use of economic instruments and in the transfer and dissemination of environmentally sound technology ;  
Believing that youth concerns should be dealt with using an integrated approach which should allow young people , who are designated key partners for the achievement of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements in paragraphs 182 ( n ) , 120 ( a ) and 120 ( b ) of the Habitat Agenda , 1 to participate fully on local , national , regional and international levels ,  
Many delegations cited specific examples of how local authorities and non-governmental organizations were being strengthened and actively involved in policies and programmes to achieve adequate shelter and sustainable development of human settlements in their respective countries .  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
In this statement , ACC underscored that the concept of sustainable development provided an over-arching policy framework for the entire spectrum of United Nations system-wide activities at the global , regional and country levels ( para . 2 ) , and called for the implementation of interrelated policies promoting economic development , improved social equity and environmental sustainability .  
In pursuance of that effort , ECA has produced several major studies on the following subjects : strategic framework on regional integration and subregional cooperation ; rethinking development in Central Africa in the twenty-first century ; making regional integration the engine for sustained growth and sustainable development at the national level ; programme for relaunching regional integration in the Central African subregion ; and renewing ECCAS : 19992001 .  
An entire new cluster of WHO technical programmes has also been established to promote health in the context of sustainable human development , including a renewed emphasis on reducing malnutrition and improving management of environmental risks to human health , integrating health dimensions into poverty reduction programmes and protecting vulnerable populations in situations of crisis and post-crisis ; promoting the synergy between health and human rights constitutes an additional priority .  
Underscores that sustainable development depends upon a healthy local , national , regional and global environment and that the United Nations Environment Programme has a major role to play in promoting actions at all levels that are designed to sustain the continued adequate functioning of ecological systems ;  
UNDPs second country programme for St . Helena ( 19931996 ) focused on developing national capacities in two areas : ( a ) sustainable livelihoods ; and ( b ) ensuring social protection throughout the transition from an aid-dependent economy dominated by the public sector to a self-financing economy , in which the private sector has an expanded role .  
The Group of Experts observed that in the context of the evolving international economic environment and globalization , it has become necessary to explore ways and means , particularly in the international taxation area , to provide an enabling environment for expansion of international trade and capital movements across national boundaries to promote financial resource mobilization for the achievement of sustainable economic growth .  
The Group of Experts was aware that an efficient and effective revenue administration can help developing countries and transitional economies to mobilize additional revenue resources and achieve greater financial self-reliance in facilitating and achieving sustainable economic development .  
There is a real threat that it may become an epoch in which the unmitigated promotion of increased international trade , investment and finance at the expense of the observance and protection of fundamental human rights and sustainable human development ( SHD ) is adopted as a mantra guiding many Governments and development economists as was amply demonstrated in the MAI process .  
In the broad context of international development issues , Agenda 211 emphasized that sustainable economic growth and development can not be achieved without taking measures to reduce losses from natural disasters , further considering the close linkages between disaster losses and environmental degradation .  
In this era of heightened financial volatility , the importance of sound macroeconomic fundamentals has become paramount : a sustainable fiscal position and current-account balance , a low or moderate rate of inflation , and consistency between the rate of inflation and the exchange rate are indispensable for any economy , as all economies are open ( albeit to different degrees ) .  
This programme aims at defining , developing and implementing a dedicated operational end-to-end satellite remote sensing capacity to provide real-time access to appropriate spatial data for supporting sustainable forest management at the subnational level .  
To ensure an enabling political , social and economic environment designed to create the best conditions for the eradication of poverty and for durable peace , based on full and equal participation of women and men , which is most conducive to achieving sustainable food security for all ;  
To pursue participatory and sustainable food , agriculture , fisheries , forestry and rural development policies and practices in high and low potential areas , which are essential to adequate and reliable food supplies at the household , national , regional and global levels , and combat pests , drought and desertification , considering the multifunctional character of agriculture ;  
To promote optimal allocation and use of public and private investments to foster human resources , sustainable food , agriculture , fisheries and forestry systems , and rural development , in high and low potential areas ;  
Intensify efforts to implement legislative and administrative measures as well as to promote public education , with special attention to youth , about the need for sustainable production and consumption patterns ; foster sustainable natural resource use ; and work concertedly to prevent environmental degradation within their countries ;  
Led by Ms . Gro Harlem Bruntland , of Norway , the Commission put forward in its 1987 report to the General Assembly the concept of sustainable development , an alternative approach to one based solely on economic growth - one " which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs " .  
Publicizing the work of the United Nations by developing and coordinating the implementation of global information campaigns on major thematic issues in the fields of economic and social development , sustainable development , women and human rights ; peacekeeping , peacemaking and humanitarian activities ; and Palestinian rights and decolonization ;  
Intensify efforts to implement legislative and administrative measures as well as to promote public education , with special attention to youth , about the need for sustainable production and consumption patterns ; foster sustainable natural resource use ; and work concertedly to prevent environmental degradation within their countries ;  
We understand sustainable development as a comprehensive and complex process with the objective of improving the quality of life for the whole population through productive growth , social development with equity and full participation by citizens under the precepts of conservation of natural resources and preservation of environmental quality .  
The importance that the Government of Bolivia attaches to population matters is reflected in its comprehensive plan for economic and social development , which , under the concept of sustainable development , cross-cuts the areas of population , gender and generational and ethnic matters and highlights reproductive health as a matter of government policy .  
A strategy has been implemented on the basis of the principles of sustainable human development , the continued growth in acquiring new knowledge , culture , the spirit of invention and popular participation through the establishment of an organized , stable and strong society with transparent and efficient institutions .  
The implementation of this strategy has yielded tangible progress in understanding the situation of our population , which is indispensable for adjusting demographic trends and certain social behaviours that are not conducive to sustainable human development .  
It is therefore of utmost importance to recognize that responses to those changing circumstances and the achievement of sustainable development and social progress will require increased solidarity and exchange of ideas and information expressed through appropriate multilateral programmes and strengthened international cooperation .  
The Cairo Programme of Action , which was the outcome of a delicate compromise made in the face of diverse and even diverging cultural , religious and philosophical values , is the expression of our common will to go beyond diversity and seek together relevant responses to the challenges of sustainable development from the perspective of population , which is certainly the most powerful factor determining the economic and social progress of nations . 
Decisive action at the national and international levels will determine whether these consequences will be either a downward spiral of increased poverty and environmental degradation or the achievement of sustainable development and improved quality of life for our people .  
From this point of view , we believe it imperative for the international community to facilitate the promotion of a supportive economic environment , particularly for developing countries in their effort to eradicate poverty and achieve sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development , as agreed at the International Conference on Population and Development .  
My country attached the utmost importance to the Cairo Conference , both in its own right and as a part of a global strategy for the promotion of sustainable development , which takes into account the recognized linkages between population , environmental protection and economic and social development .  
These objectives include economic development , poverty eradication , sustainable population growth , universal access to comprehensive reproductive health services , reduction in infant and maternal mortality and universal access to primary education , with special attention to closing the gender gap .  
It stresses the importance of sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development , acknowledging the responsibility of the developed countries in the international pursuit of sustainable development and continued efforts to promote sustained economic growth and to narrow imbalances in a manner that can benefit all countries , especially the developing ones .  
In its resolution 1999 / 4 of 7 May 1999 , the Economic and Social Council decided to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti to submit recommendations to the Council , at its substantive session of 1999 , on how to ensure that the assistance of the international community in supporting the Government of Haiti to achieve sustainable development is adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
Much has yet to be done in order to ensure that ongoing and future international assistance in support of the Government of Haiti for achieving sustainable development continues to be adequate and coherent , and that the main problems related to the coordination and effectiveness of the assistance are addressed .  
It further asserts that it is mindful of the harmful environmental impact of weapons of mass destruction and that it has constantly urged that the environment should be protected , that it should not be damaged and that its effective contribution to the achievement of sustainable development should not be impaired .  
At the same time , it is vital that such commitment by the parties be reinforced by political will and consistent , effective and determined support from the international community to guarantee the achievement of sustainable peace , including through its contributions of long-term assistance for development and trade .  
Without success in this area it is hardly possible to create the stable , just and democratic political environment which in turn is an indispensable precondition for sustainable human , economic and social development .  
At the same time , it is vital that such commitments by the parties be reinforced by political will and consistent , effective and determined support from the international community to guarantee the achievement of sustainable peace , including through its contributions of long-term assistance for development and trade .  
In this phase , it is expected that there will be intensive efforts to build , and where possible restore , basic economic structures , such as payments systems , public finances and hard budget constraints , so as to promote economic and social development as well as to make donor assistance efforts effective and sustainable .  
The main applications of this technology are to be found in the following fields : air and marine navigation , telecommunications , economic and social development , national capacity-building in formulating strategies geared to sustainable development and in solving problems in the fields of health and education , in the environmental sphere and in the areas of prevention and disaster relief .  
The Commission had subsequently identified four areas for future analytical work and expert meetings : ( a ) the respective roles of government and the private sector and the interactions between them in SME development ; ( b ) inter-firm cooperation ; ( c ) SME clustering and networking ; and ( d ) the provision of sustainable financial and non-financial services for SME development .  
While there is increasing recognition in most developing countries of the need to use such high technology input in support of sustainable development and of developmental activities , interestingly there are two interrelated issues to be addressed : firstly , promoting the technology itself and the associated problems encountered and , secondly , effective utilization of the high technology knowledge , once acquired , for sustainable development activities .  
To ensure that the programme is effective and sustainable in the face of increasing demands for technical assistance , a small increase in internal resources , equivalent to three man-months per year , will be needed for the specific purposes outlined in paragraph 79 above .  
Reiterating that the promotion of economic growth and sustainable development can not be achieved without adequate measures to prevent and reduce the impact of natural disasters and that there are close linkages between losses owing to natural disasters and environmental degradation , as emphasized in Agenda 21-3 / and in the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 , 4 / adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session ,  
Reiterating in that regard that natural disasters damage the social and economic infrastructure of all countries , although the long _ term consequences of natural disasters are especially severe for developing countries , including the least developed countries , and landlocked and small island developing States , as well as for countries with economies in transition , thus hampering their sustainable development processes ,  
Following on the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa ( S / 1998 / 318 ) , the Council addressed this question last year in its resolution 1208 ( 1998 ) which , in unequivocal terms , called on all concerned to respect the civilian and humanitarian character of refugee camps and condemned the use of such camps by combatants for the furtherance of military aims .  
Without continued efforts at international cooperation , however , smaller and many developing countries may find it difficult to never build up an adequate scientific and educational base for sustainable space technology and application programmes .  
In that regard , UNISPACE III takes special note of the initiative taken by the Integrated Global Observing Strategy Partnership to link users and providers of satellite - and surface-based data about the Earth and to foster the development of information products that increase scientific understanding and guide early warning , policy-setting and decision-making for sustainable development and environmental protection .  
In that regard , UNISPACE III takes special note of the initiative taken by the Integrated Global Observing Strategy Partnership to link users and providers of satellite-and surface-based data about the Earth and to foster the development of information products that increase scientific understanding and guide early warning , policy-setting and decision-making for sustainable development and environmental protection .  
Such activities are intended to promote energy efficiency and demand-side management ; clean energy technologies ; more widespread development and application of renewable energy technologies ; improved access to modern energy services by rural populations ; capacity-building and institutional development ; energy sector planning and management to achieve the economic , social and environmental objectives of sustainable development ; and the promotion of environmentally sound energy technologies .  
In other words , it should encompass the so-called 3 Es developed by the Director-General in connection with the 16 integrated service modules directed towards the long-term goals of sustainable industrial developmentnamely , competitive economy , productive employment and sound environment ( see document IDB . 21 / 10 , part one , p .  12 ) .  
It was worth noting that the decision had been taken by the Netherlands Embassy in Ethiopia , in close consultation with the Ethiopian authorities , since development experts in the field had concluded that UNIDOs new approach could make a difference at local level , and that the integrated programme would help to promote sustainable industrial development .  
His countrys scientific and technological potential and its understanding of the need for coordination with similar activities in Western Europe made it an excellent base for the setting up of a mechanism to enhance the effectiveness of institutions in Central and Eastern Europe in formulating programmes and projects geared to achieving environmentally sustainable development .  
The public and private sectors , civil society and NGOs had participated , together with UNIDO , in the design of that programme , whose implementation was of great importance for the countrys social , political and economic stability , sustainable industrial development being a key factor in creating a more prosperous and equitable society .  
Recalling that small island developing States are recognized as a special case for both environment and development because they are ecologically fragile and vulnerable , [ and because they face particular constraints in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ] [ and because their specific physical circumstances often create difficulties in benefiting from global economic development and thus achieving sustainable development ] ,  
Call on the international community to provide effective means , including adequate , predictable , new and additional financial resources , in accordance with chapter 33 of Agenda 21 , to support small island developing States [ , in particular the least developed amongst them ] in their efforts to achieve sustainable development ;  
At the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , the international community reiterated its recognition of the specific constraints faced by small island developing States and the need for particular support in their efforts to advance sustainable development due to their small size and remoteness , ecological fragility , vulnerability to climate change and economic vulnerabilities .  
Strengthening of national capacity for the development of a methodology or guidelines for sound practices and techniques suitable for small island developing States , for achieving the integrated management and sustainable development of the coastal and marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , building on existing experience in that area ;  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
Renewed commitment by small island developing States to the completion of national sustainable development strategies , and also , as appropriate , of subregional and regional strategies , ideally before the target date of 2002 as agreed at the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held in 1997 , so as to enable implementation to be put in place as soon as possible ;  
At its sixth session , the Commission recalled that a vulnerability index that takes account of the constraints arising from small size and environmental fragility , as well as the incidence of natural disasters on a national scale , and the consequent relationship of those constraints to economic vulnerability , would assist in defining the vulnerability of small island developing States and in identifying the challenges to their sustainable development .  
In addition to improving coordination , United Nations system agencies should be more proactive in seeking the views of small island developing States across the full range of sustainable development issues in order to ensure that they take due account of both national differences and local sensitivities , in particular , sensitivities in relation to such areas as traditional knowledge and the special place of local and indigenous communities . 
The Commission had subsequently identified four areas for future analytical work and expert meetings : ( a ) the respective roles of government and the private sector and the interactions between them in SME development ; ( b ) inter-firm cooperation ; ( c ) SME clustering and networking ; and ( d ) the provision of sustainable financial and non-financial services for SME development .  
Such action is needed in order to enhance international and regional security ; reduce the risk of armed conflict , political violence , terrorism and violent crime ; combat and suppress the illicit trafficking in small arms ; promote sustainable peace settlements and good governance ; and , above all , stop human suffering . 
Moreover , the joint UNDP / UNCTAD Programme on Globalization , Liberalization and Sustainable Human Development , which was initiated in 1998 , supports the development of a conceptual and analytical framework articulating globalization and sustainable human development and the strengthening of the negotiation capacities of poor countries , to enable them to participate better in the negotiations of multilateral trade , investment and financial agreements .  
On this basis , I am confident that an appropriate mechanism will be found to meet the aspirations of the Government of Haiti as well as the desire of the international community to elaborate a long-term , coordinated and well-managed plan for Haiti 's sustainable social , economic and institutional development .  
It reads : To play a leading role in advancing comprehensive and sustainable human development through the enhanced participation of Jordanians , the Jordanian Hashemite Fund for Human Development strives to impact best development practices at the national level , drawing on its experience and local presence , while creating opportunities and expanding the choices of Jordanians to play a central role in the process of shaping the countrys future . 
Whether initiating or sponsoring research , training and education on the United Nations and United Nations reform , on the Great Lakes region of Africa , on early conflict warning and prevention , on disarmament , the status of women , racism and racial discrimination , human rights and sustainable development and environmental protection , WFUNA remains committed to examining the critical issues before the United Nations and to help find solutions that will shape our common future .  
Generally , small island developing States recognized the extremely vital and critical role of donor support in attaining the goals of the Programme of Action , and called on the international community not to judge their eligibility for concessional assistance solely by the indicator of per capita income , which ignores their fragility , vulnerability and inability to generate adequate national savings relative to the enormity of investment required for sustainable development .  
Along the same line , it was proposed that small island developing States need to adopt a programme approach instead of a project-by-project approach in sustainable development planning , and to mainstream projects and programmes into comprehensive integrated national sustainable development plans that incorporate the economic , social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
Donors called for the strengthening of small island developing States statistical capabilities so that they may develop suitable indicators of progress in sustainable development , in particular indicators for monitoring the performance of projects and programmes to ensure that external funding is effectively utilized and set targets are attained .  
The Central American Governments must also contend with regional disparities among their countries in terms of human development , economic performance and their respective political and legal frameworks , all of which are obstacles to achieving integrated and sustainable arrangements for economic growth and stable political processes .  
During the past year , the priorities of ALIDES have been advanced through a wide range of initiatives and meetings at various levels of government , encompassing the social sector , public finance and economic growth , environmental protection and sustainable development , and the strengthening of SICA and other regional institutions as a means of pursuing the goals of ALIDES .  
The UNDP policy document entitled Integrating human rights with sustainable human development embraces a holistic vision integrating all human , civil , cultural , economic , political and social rights .  
A policy framework that integrates macroeconomic , financial , structural , social and human issues is imperative if there is to be equitable and sustainable development .  
Ensuring access to basic social services for the unreached , the vulnerable and the most disadvantaged members of society is not only morally imperative but also economically rational , eradicating the worst manifestation of poverty and laying the foundations for sustainable economic growth and productivity gains in the future .  
Given IMOs global regulatory mandate , which encompasses the development of international rules and standards designed to enhance the safety of life at sea and protect the marine environment from pollution caused by ships , the twin fundamentals of sustainable development and poverty alleviation have evolved in recent years as parallel concerns to the Organization .  
Complying with UNIDOs commitment in the position paper to treat industrialization as an effective means of accelerating growth essential to rapid economic and social development , the research wing of the organization prepared a few concept papers , focusing on the crucial role of agro-industry in income generation and employment creation contributing to sustainable livelihood patterns .  
The Seminar was also to review the political , economic and social conditions in the small island Non-Self-Governing Territories and to identify areas in which the international community could increase and enhance its participation in the programmes of assistance and adopt a comprehensive and integrated approach to ensure the political and sustainable socio-economic development of the Territories concerned .  
At the second Consultative Group Meeting for the Reconstruction and Transformation of Central America , co-hosted by the Inter-American Development Bank and the Government of Sweden and held in Stockholm , from 25 to 28 May 1999 , the Governments of the region , the principal donors and civil society representatives renewed their commitment to democratic change and sustainable human development as the best means of reducing social and ecological vulnerability to future disasters .  
The Central American Governments must also contend with regional disparities between their countries in terms of human development , economic performance and their respective political and legal frameworks , all of which are obstacles to achieving integrated and sustainable arrangements for economic growth and stable political processes .  
One of the key aspects of operational activities for development is facilitating the transfer of technology and expanding the access to technological information , and the creation of information flows on affordable and sustainable technology which is suitable to a specific country , establishing information networks with relevant institutions and business firms .  
The independent expert welcomed the decision of the Economic and Social Council , contained in its resolution 1998 / 4 of 7 May 1999 , to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti that would submit recommendations to the Council on how to ensure that international community assistance to the efforts to support the Government of Haiti in achieving sustainable development is adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
This common approach both preventive and reactive is comprised of multiple and coordinated international , regional and national efforts that contribute to sustainable peace in areas prone or affected by conflict .  
Moreover , the special combination of inputs technical assistance and emergency supplies on the one hand and materials for construction and water equipment on the other ( benefiting approximately 110,000 people ) has made possible the implementation of an integrated emergency and rehabilitation programme whose overall objective is to facilitate a smooth and sustainable transition from emergency to development , through effective and direct involvement of the beneficiaries themselves . 
The favourable response with which the United Nations system and other governmental and non-governmental organizations greeted the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa led us to believe that the international community would , in a meaningful way , join in the activities undertaken by Africa to resolve conflicts , consolidate democracy and ensure economic and social development .  
An enabling political environment conducive to human rights , good governance and a vibrant civil society are essential for sustainable development .  
Well over a year ago , the Secretary-General outlined in an earlier report recommendations that , if pursued by the international community with adequate political will , would have advanced the course of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa beyond its current stage . 
With the acceleration in the pace of globalization in the early 1990s came the expectation that growth and development based on global market forces would be more rapid , more sustainable and more widely shared than in the past , allowing developing countries to narrow the gap with industrial countries and the poorest sections of society to close the income gap with the rich . 
As the principal forum of the United Nations for the integrated treatment of development and interrelated issues in the areas of trade , finance , investment , technology and sustainable development , UNCTAD is expected to make a substantial contribution to the pursuit of the international communitys common development objectives .

Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
Stability and efficiency of the national as well as regional financial markets , increased domestic savings and optimal allocation of resources are a sound basis for sustainable economic growth .  
It is therefore important that developing countries , when implementing economic reforms , increasing export competitiveness and building a favourable investment climate , are placed in a position that allows them to carry out such tax , social , environmental and regulatory policies , which are critical in terms of sustainable development .  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Recognizing that mutually supportive efforts at the national and international levels are imperative in the pursuit of sustainable development , which includes , inter alia , the provision of financial resources and the transfer of technology for the application of cost-effective energy systems and wider use of environmentally friendly , renewable energies ,  
Encourages the Secretary-General to make efforts to promote public awareness activities in all Member States , with the support of international , regional and national institutions , both public and private , regarding the strategic importance of the Global Renewable Energy Education and Training Programme 1996-2005 in attaining the objective of sustainable development ;  
In that regard , foreign direct investment , technical assistance for national capacity-building and export outlets were but a few of the indispensable conditions for the participation of the South in world trade .  Vigorous and sustainable economic growth , which could greatly foster employment and poverty eradication efforts , was vital .  
The UNITAR Fellowship Programme on the Legal Aspects of Debt and Financial Management has been developed to meet a need in providing training to public officials from sub-Saharan Africa in the various legal aspects of debt management with a view to developing sustainable capacity for the efficient management of international debt .  
Economic growth was strongly correlated with poverty alleviation , and thus the most useful approach lay in the creation of a sound macroeconomic foundation for sustainable growth , with open markets , transparent regulatory systems , strong financial oversight and participatory decision-making .  
Greater access to the markets of industrialized countries , international financial stability and technological cooperation on an equitable and sustainable basis were indispensable to improving the conditions of developing countries in the era of globalization .  
Core elements of a new poverty eradication strategy should include a broadly based understanding of the mechanisms of sustainable poverty reduction ; the selection of those public interventions that would have the largest impact on the poor and reduce their vulnerability by reducing income volatility resulting from global and domestic shocks and natural disasters ; and the establishment of outcome indicators .  
ILO encouraged employment policies based on economic growth , enhanced opportunities for lifelong learning and training , flexible job planning to extend working lives , and innovative and sustainable social security and pension policies .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
National , regional and international efforts to find solutions to economic and social problems and to resolve conflicts must be increased if women were to be effectively involved in sustainable national development .  
While his delegation believed that the role of civil society was crucial for the effective realization of sustainable development goals , it would caution against those who sought to have the Commissions process duplicate or otherwise unduly influence issues and negotiations on matters better left in the forums where they were more appropriately addressed .  
His delegation stood behind the Barbados Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States and recognized the many pressing issues that bore upon the small island States progress towards sustainable development , including the public health and economic effects of global warming , the conservation of fish stocks and the strain that increased tourism placed on local infrastructure .  
It had developed a legislative framework for environmental protection and a national concept of sustainable development , and was working on legal , administrative and economic instruments to ensure sustainable development .  
Progress towards sustainable development required the establishment of an international legal framework for managing deteriorating natural resources , enhanced coordination among international institutions in the environmental field , global guidance for the emerging environmental agenda and the pursuit of feasible solutions for the implementation of Agenda 21 .  
This policy should include , as a minimum , culmination of the process of adapting the substantive and procedural legal framework to the requirements of international norms governing collective bargaining and trade union freedom , and the review of State institutions in order to ensure that the planning process throughout the country will include educational , preventive and promotional dimensions , with the necessary budgetary appropriation to make them sustainable .  
As regards education and health , in addition to the twin challenges of continuing to expand coverage and ensure that the amount of money actually spent is no less than the amount budgeted , there is the challenge of making sure that the new schemes for the provision of services are sustainable and that the quality of services is improved , inter alia by ensuring that they are better tailored to the multicultural and multilingual characteristics of Guatemalan society .  
His Governments long-term sustainable development strategies were aimed at upgrading the living standard of the citizens of Fiji , eradicating poverty , empowering women and youth , increasing employment and protecting the environment , in particular from land degradation and the trans-shipment of hazardous and toxic material across the oceans .  
It had enacted a law on the sustainable use of Fijis limited renewable and non-renewable land and sea resources and readjusted its sectoral policies with a view to ensuring sustained natural resource utilization ; the development of human-resource-based industries ; the improvement of social services in the fields of health , education and housing ; poverty alleviation ; rural and urban development ; and disaster management .

Encourages multilateral institutions , Governments and the private sector , including corporations engaged in international activities , to strengthen partnerships to advance sustainable development through , inter alia , supporting the stable functioning of the international finance and trade system and investment flows ;  
Mr . Robertson ( New Zealand ) , speaking also on behalf of Australia and Canada , said that the central message of the Cairo Conference reinforced at the twenty-first special session of the General Assembly was that population issues were development issues and that the Cairo agenda should be considered as part of a global framework for sustained and sustainable development . 
At the programme level , UNIDO had developed a portfolio of integrated services to address the challenges of industrial growth in Africa , focusing on the three core dimensions of sustainable industrial development : a competitive economy , productive employment and a sound environment .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;

Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Stresses the importance of international economic , financial and technical cooperation and assistance , both bilateral and multilateral , in supporting the efforts of the Central American Governments to continue to implement the programme for the sustainable development of the region ;  
Again stresses the need for the international community to maintain its cooperation , both bilateral and multilateral , with the Central American countries and to provide them with the necessary financial resources , in a sustained manner and on soft terms , with a view to promoting effectively sustainable human development and the consolidation of peace , freedom and democracy in the region ;  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;

The Caribbean region and sea possessed a number of unique features which justified according them priority attention : exceptional biological diversity , highly fragile ecosystems and heavy reliance by most of the countries of the region on the coastal land and marine environment in order to achieve sustainable development .  
The relationship between the environment and mankind had been discussed at Rio , where it had been recognized that States had common but differentiated responsibilities and that sustainable development required adequate scientific , technical and financial resources .  
Regrettably , the United Nations system continued to face constraints already addressed in earlier sustainable development efforts , including lack of financial and human resources , lack of institutional capacity , and vague mandates and roles of agencies , as mentioned by the Secretary-General in his report ( A / 54 / 131 ) .  
In accordance with article 19 of the Convention , there was an urgent need to consider modalities for advance informed agreement outlining appropriate procedures in the field of safe transfer , handling and use of any a living modified organism resulting from biotechnology that might have adverse effects on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
Even though it was true that primary responsibility for the implementation of Agenda 21 lay with each individual country , it was also true that international cooperation was an important complementary factor in taking advantage of the real benefits of sustainable development .  
The Council reaffirms its resolve and determination to face the challenges and to overcome them with a deep sense of faith in God and an unshakeable confidence in the capability and potential of its people and of their union to achieve their hopes and aspirations for a resplendent future of comprehensive , sustainable development safeguarded by social justice and abounding in prosperity and growth .

These measures include the reconstruction of homes destroyed in the war , as well as the building of new homes and communal and social infrastructure ; they also include fiscal and other measures , and encouraging balanced economic growth and development in such areas .  11 .  In 1997 , the National Programme for the Development of the Islands , and the Islands Act were adopted , based on the principle of sustainable development .  
The National Programme for Sustainable Development , which is being prepared , includes the social , demographic , economic , environmental , educational , ethical and strategic and political aspects of sustainable development , and is aimed at the definition of guidelines for the general development of the country to emphasize the right of every individual to his or her own dignity and development , in accordance with international conventions signed by the Republic of Croatia .  
The primary components of the draft sustainable energy and climate change strategy include : promoting strategic innovations in the delivery of sustainable energy services in rural areas of developing countries ; increasing the use of market-based policies to achieve climate change objectives ; and encouraging the participation of developing countries in climate change negotiations by promoting their capacity to identify , negotiate and implement key issues .

The main thrust of Namibias national action programme to combat decertification was that the social , economic , legal and political environment should be reconciled with the natural environment in order to enhance the sustainable use of natural resources .  
The first principle was the necessity to preserve outer space exclusively for peaceful uses and to promote international cooperation in the use of outer space for such purposes , taking into account the imperative of achieving continued economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular developing countries .  
Safety and security are basic human rights and essential to economic development , therefore it is imperative that scarce resources be invested in programmes likely to protect such rights in a responsible and sustainable way .  
The basic aim of integration of our countries at the present stage is to complete the creation of a Customs Union as a prerequisite for boosting our national economies , raising the standard of living of our peoples and achieving sustainable democratic development .  
Assisting Governments in the development of coherent and effective legal regimes at the global , regional and national levels which address major environmental issues in the context of sustainable development ;

As a result , Bahrain has been able to build an open and developed economy that has made it possible for the country to realize comprehensive and sustainable human development , as reflected in its remarkable ranking in the human development index for five consecutive years .  
There must , therefore , be a constructive dialogue between developing and developed countries , a dialogue based on common interests , genuine interrelations and mutual responsibilities aimed at ensuring sustainable development and social justice .  
May I conclude my statement by expressing my conviction that , in order to increase life expectancy , improve health-care indicators and the quality of social life , and successfully confront the very specific problems of older persons , it is crucial to have an international economic order that is just , fair and sustainable and makes it possible for these challenges to be met , regardless of the difficulty of surrounding circumstances .  
In conclusion , may I express my delegation ' s sincere hope that the ongoing deliberations on the implementation of the outcome of the Summit will help generate the renewed political will at the national and international levels that is so needed to attain the noble objectives of sustainable human development .  
In the four years since the Summit , the developing countries have enjoyed little in the way of the technical and financial cooperation for development that was committed and certainly they have not engaged the path to rapid , broad-based sustainable development.It is in fact somewhat difficult to undertake a review of progress made in follow-up activities when the economic picture today is bleaker than it was at the time of the Summit .  
Let me refer to the European Union Common Position of 2 December 1996 , and reiterate on this occasion that the main objective of the European Union in its relations with Cuba is to encourage a process of gradual and peaceful transition to pluralistic democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , as well as sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people .  
Continued financial assistance from the international community for the Bethlehem 2000 project is needed for the creation of a strong , self-sufficient and sustainable economic infrastructure for Bethlehem that would provide a sound underpinning for social and political stability , which is a prerequisite for peace in the region .  
Factors that have a direct or indirect impact on peace , such as the environment , natural resources , sustainable development , quality of life , technology and international relations , are studied in terms of their real impact on peace and not as isolated topics .  
In a world still governed by a narrow realism , sometimes sterile but always destructive , it is clear that those who envisage a better future for humanity will have much to do to definitively set in motion the dynamic of change that is so necessary for sustainable human development .  
In my delegation ' s view , the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is a fundamental means of ensuring the peaceful and sustainable use and development of the oceans and their resources , through , in particular , the promotion of international cooperation , the equitable and efficient utilization and preservation of living marine resources , and the protection and preservation of the marine environment .  
Hence , gaining a growing number of adherents across cultural , social and economic lines , democracy is increasingly being recognized as an appropriate response to a wide range of human concerns , and as an ingredient for both sustainable development and lasting peace .  
The Fourth Committee welcomed the outcome of the Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of Outer Space , held in Vienna from 19 to 30 July 1999 , and it endorsed the practical benefits and potential offered in all areas of human activity by space technology , the peaceful application of which can contribute to increasing the quality of live and to sustainable economic and social development .  
An enabling political environment conducive to human rights , good governance and a vibrant civil society are essential for sustainable development .  
This fact has always prompted us to restate the principle of full respect for the delicate balance between the major organs of the international Organization as set out in the Charter , in particular the inherent role of the General Assembly in considering principles of cooperation aimed at relieving human suffering , including addressing the causes of conflict and the strengthening of lasting peace and sustainable development .  
An integral part of promoting sustainable human development is respect for all social and economic rights , as well as cultural , civil and political rights .  
Notwithstanding the difficult economic and social conditions existing in many African countries and the environmental and desertification-related problems , the continent is doing all it can to create conditions for sustained economic growth and sustainable development in Africa .  
Iraq was one of the pioneers in adopting organized scientific planning to mobilize and develop human and financial resources so as to achieve sustainable economic growth aimed at bringing about the prosperity of human beings and at maintaining their right to their natural resources and their environmental rights .  
However , it is always worth remembering that sustainable development is conditional upon a rapid stabilization of the worlds population , which keeps on growing , particularly in the poor countries , where growth rates are highest , and requires , despite the progress that has been made in the last five years , the mobilization of sufficient resources from the international community , and from the donor countries in particular , to enable the poor countries to overcome their financial limitations . 
In 1994 , at the historic International Conference on Population and Development the largest intergovernmental conference on population and development ever held we pledged our collective efforts to addressing the critical challenges and interrelationships between population and sustained economic growth in the context of sustainable development .  
What we all have in common is the wish and the request of peoples to have a better standard of living than they had in the past , real sustainable development and sustained growth in their countries and for their human rights and freedoms to be fully protected and observed .  
This clearly shows how we intend to move forward in our future efforts and that we are serious about seeking to complement social and economic policy with sustainable development initiatives.A concrete proposal which we are currently pursuing is the idea that the outer island health centres should have solar-power electricity .  
Recalling that small island developing States are recognized as a special case for both environment and development because they are ecologically fragile and vulnerable , and because they face particular constraints in their efforts to achieve sustainable development and because their specific physical circumstances often create difficulties in benefiting from global economic development and thus achieving sustainable development ,  
At the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , the international community reiterated its recognition of the specific constraints faced by small island developing States and the need for particular support in their efforts to advance sustainable development due to their small size and remoteness , ecological fragility , vulnerability to climate change and economic vulnerabilities .  
Strengthening of national capacity for the development of a methodology or guidelines for sound practices and techniques suitable for small island developing States , for achieving the integrated management and sustainable development of the coastal and marine areas under the sovereignty or national jurisdiction of small island developing States , building on existing experience in that area ;  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
Renewed commitment by small island developing States to the completion of national sustainable development strategies , and also , as appropriate , of subregional and regional strategies , ideally before the target date of 2002 as agreed at the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held in 1997 , so as to enable implementation to be put in place as soon as possible ;  
At its sixth session , the Commission recalled that a vulnerability index that takes account of the constraints arising from small size and environmental fragility , as well as the incidence of natural disasters on a national scale , and the consequent relationship of those constraints to economic vulnerability , would assist in defining the vulnerability of small island developing States and in identifying the challenges to their sustainable development .  
In addition to improving coordination , United Nations system agencies should be more proactive in seeking the views of small island developing States across the full range of sustainable development issues in order to ensure that they take due account of both national differences and local sensitivities , in particular , sensitivities in relation to such areas as traditional knowledge and the special place of local and indigenous communities .  
I have a clear duty also to insist that the intellectual debate on how to strengthen the sustainable development prospects for a uniquely fragile and vulnerable group of countries is informed by the most current thinking , produced by those who fully understand the complex circumstances of the countries for which they prescribe solutions .  
We believe that the Barbados Programme of Action , which calls for actions to be implemented at the national , regional and international levels , provides for an integrated and comprehensive basis for the sustainable development of small island developing States .  
Mr . Snijders ( Suriname ) : Before the Rio Conference and the adoption of Agenda 21 , successive Governments and the people of the Republic of Suriname , 90 per cent of which is covered by tropical rainforest , were able to recognize the need to pursue sustainable economic development , while at the same time safeguarding the environment.Thus they recognized their moral obligation to conserve the rainforest and a sound environment for future generations .  
Following the adoption of Agenda 21 and the Barbados Programme of Action , the Government of Suriname acknowledged the necessity of strengthening its capacity for the sustainable management of its natural resources through , inter alia , the creation of appropriate institutional mechanisms to design and enforce sound environmental policies capable of countering the pressures and challenges arising from the promotion of economic development .  
The United Nations Global Conference on the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States , held in Barbados in 1994 , was aware of the enormous challenges facing these States when it adopted the Programme of Action , now considered the starting point for the sustainable development of small island developing States , whose ability to protect themselves against natural disasters is indeed limited .  
They also take into account our national priorities in such fields as social development strategies for the twenty-first century , health and environment in the context of sustainable development , development of human resources in the field of meteorology , proper management of water resources , integrated environmental management against pollution caused by industrial activity , protection of the atmosphere and the enhancement of the capacity of the States environmental research centre .  
These factors do indeed have a key role to play in terms of successful and sustainable development , and it goes without saying that human and institutional capacities are a prerequisite for addressing environmental , economic and social issues in the decision-making process simultaneously . 
The United Nations system itself must continue to play the role of catalyst and stimulant in implementing the Barbados Programme of Action ; it must make more effective use of existing resources and improve the coordinating machinery for focused , agreed implementation activities in priority areas for the achievement of the sustainable development of small island developing States .  
Island States must elaborate suitable national and regional sustainable development strategies and create domestic political , economic , social , environmental and legal conditions that promote the implementation of these strategies .  
In this regard , it is imperative that the developed countries ensure the transfer of technology and technical assistance and reverse the downward trend of official development assistance if they really want to help the developing world to attain sustainable development .  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
Developing countries priorities are to eradicate poverty , with international support for achieving poverty reduction targets as agreed in United Nations conferences and summits , and improve standards of living , including meeting basic needs and lessening the burden of external debt , while taking all possible steps to avoid environmental damage and social inequity , for the furtherance of sustainable development .  
Engage industries and economic sectors , in both public and private sectors , and all other major groups at the national and international levels , as appropriate , in activities relating to sustainable consumption and production with the objective of developing optimal strategies and or programmes , including targets and timetables , at the appropriate levels for more sustainable consumption and production , including cleaner production and affordable eco-efficiency .  
Increase efforts to address the critical issues of fresh water and sanitation in human settlements in developing countries through , inter alia , the transfer of environmentally sound technologies and the provision of financial resources for implementation , as elaborated in Agenda 21 , as a priority of the international agenda on sustainable consumption and production ;  
Some delegations stated that cleaner production and eco-efficiency , based on improved skills , technologies and efficient use of energy and resources , were essential to sustainable development in both developed and developing countries .  
To develop environmentally , socially and culturally compatible forms of tourism and to continue the development and implementation of voluntary initiatives in support of sustainable tourism development , bearing in mind that such forms of tourism and initiatives should meet , or preferably exceed , relevant local , national , regional or international standards ;  
To support national efforts by countries , especially developing countries and countries with economies in transition , and major groups towards sustainable tourism development through relevant capacity-building activities and programmes as well as multilateral and bilateral financial and technical assistance , and appropriate technologies in all aspects of sustainable tourism development , including environmental impact assessment and management and education in the field of tourism ;  
To undertake a comprehensive survey and assessment of the results of implementing existing voluntary initiatives and guidelines relating to the economic , sociocultural and environmental sustainability of tourism , to be reported to the Commission on Sustainable Development in order to identify best practices with respect to raising awareness of sustainable tourism development ;  
It was emphasized that a global framework and plan of action for sustainable tourism must be coupled with implementation and decision-making at the local level , as well as at the regional and national levels .  
Promoting broad-based sustainable development through tourism while safeguarding the integrity of local cultures and protecting the environment requires an effective partnership between key stakeholders at the local , national , regional and international levels and participation at all levels of tourism planning , development and assessment .  
On fisheries and other marine living resources , participants stressed the crucial importance in much of the world of ensuring continuing sustainable supply of food from the oceans and seas ( a matter of particular moment for many communities in developing countries ) as well as the need to protect marine biological diversity .  
In its discussions , the Committee considered the pending issues pertaining to a sustainable energy future , and identified the seven most critical issues that require urgent attention during the preparatory process , particularly by the Open-ended Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Energy and Sustainable Development and by the Commission .  
The Commission may wish to express its recognition of outstanding development issues and constraints related to sustainable energy development , which should facilitate sustainable energy policies to be formulated and implemented , especially at the national level within a regional context .  
Innovative and new approaches for financing development of sustainable energy , including renewable sources of energy is required and essential while continuing to pursue efforts to increase official development assistance , ensure continued replenishment of the Global Environmental Facility and encourage domestic and foreign private investments .  
For many developing countries , human , technical and financial resources are still not adequate , imposing severe restraints on their domestic capacity to meet the requirements of developing and using sustainable energy systems .  
In addition , the design and development are lacking of a common strategy for energy-related activities in the system aimed at promoting a balanced and mutually reinforcing approach to the economic , social and environmental aspects of sustainable energy development and of fostering partnership for sustainable energy development with relevant actors outside the United Nations system .  
Mr . Nebenzia ( Russian Federation ) said that his country attached great importance to international cooperation for the sustainable development of human settlements and the improvement of the social and economic conditions of urban and rural populations.In that context , the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements played a vital role as guarantor of the implementation of the decisions taken at the Habitat II Conference .  
Similarly , at the national level , there was a growing awareness that sustainable development , as well as the prevention and peaceful settlement of most contemporary conflicts , depended on effective guarantees of human rights .  
In the light of the immense potential of space remote sensing in providing vital input for soil conservation , water resources , management , forest monitoring , land management , coastal and river basin protection , agriculture and drought management , and flood mapping and sustainable integrated development , action must be initiated to promote intensive cooperation among various countries within the region to enable them to benefit from each others expertise .  
Calls upon States to adopt unilateral , bilateral , regional and multilateral measures so as to contribute to ensuring the application of scientific and technological progress in the framework of international security , disarmament and other related spheres , without detriment to the environment or to its effective contribution to attaining sustainable development ;  
FAO has developed frameworks and guidelines for the implementation of the approach , including documents entitled Our land our future : a new approach to land use planning and management ( 1996 ) ; Negotiating a sustainable future for the land , structural and institutional guidelines on natural resource management in the twenty-first century ( 1997 ) ; and The future of our land : facing the challenge , guidelines for integrated planning for sustainable management of land resources ( 1998 ) .  
The farming systems approach to development is considered to be potentially useful in improving planning and analytical capacity in identifying , developing and implementing ways to improve the productivity and therefore welfare of those involved in agriculture in a manner that is equitable and sustainable .  
A subsequent project identified the major causes for erosion and the high sedimentation of the Rewa River , and elaborated a detailed programme combining legal aspects , flood control , river regulation and appropriate land management practices for sustainable development of agricultural lands .  
Under the Commissions work programme on indicators for sustainable development and work programme on changing consumption and production patterns , a preliminary core set of indicators have been developed for consumption and production patterns , based on an expert group meeting held at the United Nations in March 1998 .  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasizing also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
The major challenge facing the international community is to assist Governments , especially those of developing countries , to promote tourism development within the framework of sustainable development in order to maximize the potential economic and social benefits from tourism without damaging the environment or cultural assets .  
The international community also has an important role in assisting developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , economies in transition and small island developing States , through the provision of financial and technical assistance to governments at all levels , to develop a range of meaningful and effective planning guidelines , codes of good practice , regulatory frameworks and policy provisions aimed at achieving sustainable tourism .  
The experience is that these soft forms of tourism can be just as destructive as mass tourism , if they are not planned , developed and managed in a sustainable manner , so as to ensure that there are no adverse effects on the natural environment or the local sociocultural fabric , and that the local community is involved in all development and management phases .  
The main adverse impacts of tourism on the environment are connected to pressure on natural resources , harm to wildlife and habitats ( with associated loss of biological diversity ) , the generation of pollution and wastes , and social and cultural pressures related to the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity .  
A number of initiatives have been taken by Governments , in all parts of the world to : ( a ) develop national strategies or master plans for sustainable development of tourism ; ( b ) develop appropriate regulatory mechanisms and tools , such as environmental assessment and the development of building regulations and environmental standards for tourism ; ( c ) create terrestrial and marine protected areas ; and ( d ) support voluntary initiatives by the tourism industry .  
WTO has also been active , focusing in particular on planning at the national and local levels and on indicators for sustainable tourism , and addressing sustainable tourism in a number of regional forums . 4 A number of other international organizations have developed activities for sustainable tourism ; in particular , UNESCO has addressed , inter alia , tourism in World Heritage Sites and cultural tourism . 
Examining the challenge of averting internal population displacements , the workshop recognized that prevention is a multifaceted undertaking , involving a range of related tasks : eliminating poverty and promoting sustainable development ; ensuring respect for human and minority rights ; establishing equitable and democratic forms of government ; encouraging the peaceful resolution of disputes ; ending social injustice and averting the growth of ethnic or communal antagonisms .  
Emphasizing the necessity for the developing countries , in particular African countries and least developed countries , for a domestic industrial transformation of their commodity production with a view to enhancing productivity and stabilizing and increasing their export earnings , thus promoting the sustainable economic growth of developing countries in their integration into the global economy ,  
The Bah International Community , with over five-million members from all strata of society organized as approximately 17 , 000 local communities and 175 national and regional communities , is committed to peace and engaged in a wide range of activities.These activities include but are not limited to fostering grass-roots participation in sustainable development initiatives , advancing the status of women , eliminating racism , and promoting and protecting human rights . 
At the regional level , ongoing activities conducive to the sustainable management of coastal and marine resources include training of personnel , acquisition of equipment and facilities , production of stock assessment data and other resource inventories , upgrading of skills for management of marine parks , studies on pollution , information exchange and sharing of experience from within and outside the regions , and production of ICAM plans using regional guidelines .  
Small island developing States also have been the recipients of formal and informal training efforts to improve their capacity to implement sustainable coastal and marine resource management from regional and international institutions .  
ICAM is often seen as an environmental rather than a sustainable development programme ; thus , it has often received limited funding from national budgets ; further , many small island developing States do not have the environmental tools ( for example , indicators for integrating environmental considerations with economic development ) for decision-making , which would allow Governments to estimate the true cost of environmental degradation ;  
Development of a policy and adoption of effective methods for the sustainable development of EEZs ; the small land area of small island developing States has resulted in efforts to extend their activities towards the sea ( for example , reclamation of land , marine-based tourism , exploitation of minerals and oil ) ; these plans will have significant impacts on the fragile and vulnerable marine ecosystems of these States if not implemented with the utmost precaution , based on a systematic approach .  
Enhancing the capability of small island developing States to ( i ) assess and monitor fish catch and the processing and marketing of fish by foreign and domestic fishing companies ; ( ii ) develop a legal framework for sustainable fisheries activities ; and ( iii ) develop management plans and policies for assessing , monitoring and exploiting both the living and non-living resources in the EEZ ;  
Completion and implementation as called for under article 6 of the Convention on Biodiversity , of comprehensive national biodiversity strategy and action plans that , by individual country , ( i ) assess the state of knowledge on biodiversity ; ( ii ) identify vulnerable and endangered ecosystems and species ; ( iii ) identify activities and processes that endanger biodiversity ; and ( iv ) contain strategies for the protection and sustainable use of island biodiversity .  
Most small island developing States would derive tremendous benefits from the introduction of environmentally sustainable technological innovations in the areas of the development of renewable energy , freshwater and marine resources ; telecommunications and information technology ; waste management and natural disaster mitigation ; and sustainable land resources management .  
Given the serious lack of resources and qualified personnel in small island developing States , a realistic short-to-medium term strategy for building scientific and technological capacity to manage the effective transition to sustainable development would be to concentrate on subregional measures , wherever feasible .  
Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote the role and capacity of small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries within the framework of a dialogue between the private and the public sector .  
Recognizes that effective , equitable , development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ;  
The foregoing national measures need to be supplemented by measures at the regional level , including ( a ) the implementation of a sustainable marketing strategy at the regional level , and ( b ) the adoption of uniform incentives at the regional level to reduce competition among small island developing States to attract foreign capital .  
The contribution of those living in extreme poverty could be of decisive importance in current thinking on sustainable human development and the right to development , especially since the concept of development is no longer viewed only from an economic standpoint , but also in social and cultural terms .  
I should therefore like to assure you once again that I am determined to proceed with the effective implementation of a whole range of political , structural , economic and military reforms that are required in order to consolidate peace and promote sustainable development .  
The present section summarizes , by region and by sea , the main priorities and challenges , developments in decision-making , and activities at the national level to promote integrated coastal zone management , marine environment protection , and sustainable use and conservation of marine living resources .  
The major challenges of the region are to secure a healthy sea environment at a time when economic recovery is being pursued ; completion of effective regulatory and institutional frameworks , particularly for integrated coastal zone management and sustainable fisheries ; and enhancement of public awareness and cooperation between stakeholders .  
During the period under review , a number of small island developing States in all regions have been affected by adverse economic developments which have impaired their financial capacity to implement even priority sustainable development measures.This is particularly true for the Pacific small island developing States , where a combination of internal and external factors have impinged adversely on their economic performance .  
This will require that the Programme of Action be firmly placed on the political agenda at the national , regional and international levels and be fully recognized by Governments and civil society in all small island developing States and the international community as the framework for sustainable development activities in small island developing States .  
Stressing that any credible strategy for the reduction of the natural disaster effects of future El Nio occurrences must be based on effective dialogue and cooperation between the scientific and technological areas of the United Nations system and its operational responsibilities in the fields of disaster management , humanitarian assistance , sustainable development , technical cooperation and capacity-building , including data-collection , monitoring and early warning systems , at all levels ,  
The main users will be authorities and government officials concerned with environmental management and sustainable development , the programming , coordination and management of the use of natural resources and energy , human settlements , in particular ministries of housing and urban planning and local governments , and international and regional transport .  
Annual regional courses in connection with management of multiple uses of water , rights to water use and regulation of water-related public utility companies ; and the management of sustainable development at the local level ; ( iii ) Projects .  
To help strengthen the capacities of developing countries in sustainable human development through TCDC , the Unit supported a number of strategic initiatives aimed at increasing the sharing of experiences in critical areas and strengthening networking among centres of excellence .  
During its first session , the Commission on Enterprise , Business Facilitation and Development recognized the crucial role played by small and medium enterprises ( SMEs ) in stimulating broad-based , equitable and sustainable development , as well as the role of the changing global economic environment and the pressures this puts on SMEs .  
In the light of the above , the Commission , at its third session ( 23-27 November 1998 ) , agreed to convene an expert meeting on the Development of sustainable local services and national and international support measures including financial and non-financial services , human resource development , access to information and an assessment of access to technologies , to improve and promote SME development in developing countries .  
There are also few successful examples of DFIs that have proven able to operate profitably with SMEs - among these , the Corporaci \ n Andina de Fomento ( CAF ) , a private multilateral financial institution which promotes sustainable development and regional integration by attracting capital resources for the provision of multiple financial services to the public and private sectors of the shareholding countries . 
I have the honour to refer to Economic and Social Council resolution 1999-4 of 7 May 1999 in which the Council decided to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti with the mandate of submitting to the Council at its substantive session of 1999 recommendations on how to ensure that international community assistance to the efforts to support the Government of Haiti in achieving sustainable development was adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
As you are aware , the Economic and Social Council , by its resolution 1999-4 of 7 May 1999 , decided to create an Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti with the mandate of submitting to the Council , at its substantive session of 1999 , recommendations on how to ensure that international community assistance to the efforts to support the Government of Haiti in achieving sustainable development was adequate , coherent , well coordinated and effective .  
A consensus was emerging on the fundamentals of sustainable human development , as illustrated by the fact that the Bretton Woods institutions had adopted an approach to development inspired by the United Nations , while the United Nations had moved far in supporting responsible macroeconomic policies on the part of Member States .  
While SADC welcomed debt-relief initiatives , including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ( HIPC ) debt initiative , it believed that the international community should start writing off the external debt of those countries that had made visible and sustainable progress in the implementation of tough structural adjustment measures and political reforms , so that they could invest the resources thus freed up in social sectors .  
Intensify efforts to implement legislative and administrative measures as well as to promote public education , with special attention to youth , about the need for sustainable production and consumption patterns ; foster sustainable natural resource use ; and work concertedly to prevent environmental degradation within their countries ;  
Affirming that developed countries have a major responsibility in the context of growing interdependence to create and sustain a global economic environment that is favourable to accelerated and sustainable development ,  
As part of this strategy of transformation which entails moving from reconstruction to sustainable development , we shall continue our efforts to integrate the region effectively into the global economy by implementing an agenda for competitiveness and sustainable development , based on upgrading our human resources , on making our institutions more effective and our infrastructure more appropriate and on scientific and technological progress . 
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Finally , the active involvement of the Bretton Woods institutions both in the final event and in the preparatory process was crucial : only through the coordinated efforts of the United Nations and the Bretton Woods institutions would the common objective of poverty reduction and sustainable development be achieved .  
If it was to achieve its enormous potential , that process must be accompanied by a new , just , equitable and sustainable world order , which included the active participation of the so-called third world countries in the global decision-making processes , a profound transformation of the international monetary system , a comprehensive approach to development , and a bridging of the increasing gap between the richer countries and the vast majority of poorer countries .  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences ,  
Urges also the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , provision of basic social services , poverty eradication , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of youth , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , political freedom , popular participation , respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
Also calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
The Conference agreed that an acceptable definition of the concept of sustainable development in agriculture was one in which the development satisfied the following conditions : ( a ) that it lead to the production of sufficient food ; ( b ) that it did not harm the environment ; ( c ) that it was acceptable to society ; ( d ) that it was an economically viable approach ; and ( e ) that it met the needs of the present without sacrificing the ability of future generations to meet theirs .  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financing environment and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasizing also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Emphasizing that a favourable and conducive international economic and financial environment , and a positive investment climate are necessary for the economic growth of the world economy , including the creation of employment , in particular for the growth and development of developing countries , and emphasizing also that each country is responsible for its own economic policies for sustainable development ,  
Governments should consider a range of economic instruments , such as fiscal instruments and internalization of environmental costs , to promote sustainable consumption , taking into account social needs , the need for disincentives for unsustainable practices and incentives for more sustainable practices , while avoiding potential negative effects for market access , in particular for developing countries .  
The current meeting would be another milestone in the quest for sustainable development , which represented a basic precondition for peace and collective human security for global economic order .  
Goals and targets agreed upon by the international community in relation to sustainable development , such as the adoption of national sustainable development strategies and increased support to developing countries , must be implemented in a timely fashion .  
The North must be gracious and generous , and give enough of what has been acquired from global resources to assist poor and weak countries to help propel them into the orbit of sustainable and irreversible social and economic growth .  
Each session of the General Assembly provides us with a unique opportunity to develop a unified approach and to coordinate our actions at the global level for the sake of a truly democratic , secure and sustainable development of humanity .  
We are of the view that illegal , unregulated , unreported fishing activities have a severe adverse impact on the effectiveness of measures for the sustainable management and exploitation of marine living resources .  
The quest for a unilateral security advantage for a few or the assertion of the right to an exclusive standard of national security is contrary to the spirit of a durable and sustainable system of international security in todays world .  
It also recognized that economic growth in general , supported in the context of sustainable development , is essential to ongoing social development and that welldesigned social policies have a beneficial effect on economic and social development .  
Among the main laws are the law on educational reform within the framework of sustainable human development which covers social , economic , political and cultural aspects intended to promote peoples growth as individuals and members of society .  
The annual assistance flow of around 200-million dollars has alleviated human suffering in the short run and prevented major humanitarian disasters but has not provided the foundation for sustainable development .  
Promoting community development , improving access to security of land tenure , housing and basic services , and fully integrating people living in poverty into economic , social and political life , which are crucial to sustainable development ;  
Equity demanded that the transfer of capital and technology to the emerging economies should be driven not only by the need for cheap and abundant labour , but by a desire to create viable and sustainable production and fair access to international markets .  
It had identified strengthened industrial capacity and clean and sustainable industrial development as the two main priority areas of its technical assistance to the developing countries .  
In Israel , public participation is considered crucial to the sound development of sustainable agriculture through linkages between government ministries , local authorities , the private sector , academic institutions and scientists .  
Several comprehensive programmes on sustainable farming systems are being promoted by national authorities in developed and developing countries , by regional and international institutions and NGOs .  
The dialogue segments launched in 1998 have since been recognized as a unique participatory model for effectively engaging major groups and Governments in a genuine dialogue on specific sustainable development issues .  
However , while economic growth has remained positive on average , the rate of growth has not been sustainable because it was based on external factors such as good weather and favourable commodity prices .  
Capacity 21 was another UNDP innovative initiative , which dated from 1993 and was aimed at facilitating the integration of economic , social and environmental considerations into national programmes for sustainable development .  
However , his Government was confident that with the support of civil society and the assistance of the United Nations specialized agencies , its efforts would lead to sustainable human development and improve the basic standard of living of its population .  
Urged countries to engage in raising awareness of the ecological , social , cultural and economic roles that planted and natural forests might fulfil in the rehabilitation and sustainable management of forests in environmentally critical areas ;  
A peaceful , stable and enabling political , social and economic environment is the essential foundation which will enable States to give adequate priority to food security and poverty eradication as well as sustainable and equitable development ;  
The major objective of SARD is to enhance food security ( defined as access to the food required for a healthy and productive life ) in an environmentally sound way so as to contribute to sustainable natural resource management .  
The widespread dissemination of technological information and innovative institutional practices to all stakeholders is required to enhance the ability of developing countries to introduce sustainable agricultural practices .  
A participatory democratic political system with transparency and accountability supported by rule of law and efficient administrative institutions , is required both for sustainable development and for dealing positively with globalization forces .  
Thus , it should be stressed that sustainable participatory development would not , then , be fully achieved , as it remains conditional on political , economic and social , environmental and cultural sustainability .  
At present , it is obvious that the world needs sustainable economic and social development based on strategic approaches to balanced and rational use of natural and water resources .  
To promote regional cooperation for the development and practical application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes in the interest of the sustainable social and economic development of the African continent ;  
Some have forged ahead and developed integrated , multisectoral approaches to sustainable development which necessitated the establishment of national focal points or coordinating bodies for the implementation of the outcomes of global conferences / summits .  
The major issue addressed had been the peaceful use of nuclear energy , including maritime transport of such energy , radioactive materials , nuclear safety and technical cooperation and the liability and role of nuclear energy in sustainable development .  
Raising the priority of adequate shelter and sustainable urban development in international cooperation in light of their profound links with all aspects of social development , economic growth and environmental protection ;  
National and regional sustainable development strategies allow for a more effective use of national and regional human , institutional , financial and natural resources , as well as cooperation at the regional and interregional levels .  
Noting that the consistent use of accurate place names is an essential element of effective communication worldwide , and supports socioeconomic development , sustainable development and national infrastructure ,  
Policy and institutional reforms to create a sound socioeconomic and political environment to transform the social and productive basis for development into one in which sustainable , equitable and genderbalanced development can take place .  
The State institutions responsible for labour issues should be modified to ensure a planned approach throughout the country which includes educational , preventive and promotional elements , and has a budgetary allocation sufficient to make it sustainable .  
He stressed that early entry into force of the 1995 Fish Stocks Agreement would be a major boost towards the goal of sustainable and responsible fisheries , and he emphasized that cooperation and coordination were essential also at the national level .  
To develop a legally binding framework for regulating the actions of transnational corporations ( TNCs ) , respecting the international labour , human rights , and sustainable environmental standards set by the United Nations and its relevant specialized agencies .  
Good governance , namely transparent and democratic management of public affairs by accountable national institutions , was as important as an international environment favourable to sustainable development .  
Because Kosovos health indicators are the worst in Europe , WHO is leading the process of reform from the existing centralized and specialistoriented system towards a comprehensive , horizontal and sustainable primary care approach .  
The three Es competitive economy , sound environment and productive employmentare not isolated targets , but interrelated parts that require a combined approach to achieve sustainable industrial development .  
The biggest deterrent to violent conflict is the promotion of sustainable human development and a healthy democratic society based on strong rule of law and civic institutions , including adherence to all human rights economic , social , political and cultural .  
The biggest deterrent to violent conflict is the promotion of sustainable human development and a healthy democratic society based on strong rule of law and civic institutions , including adherence to all human rights economic , social , political and cultural .  
Finally , he said that Governments , organizations and the entire international community must work together to create favourable internal and external conditions for gradual economic growth and successful , socially oriented sustainable growth for all States .  
It was essential that the Conference should be based on a global approach to development , that reflected not only basic economic aspects but also the social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
The focus should be placed on the social , economic and environmental pillars of sustainable development , as expressed in broad themes recognized as the main challenges before the international community .  
Rich in biodiversity , the countries of the Rio Group had made huge efforts at the national , regional and subregional level to protect their environment and to balance economic , social and environmental factors in promoting genuine sustainable development .  
Flows of private capital to certain developing countries must not be counted as contributions towards sustainable development , as the main driving force behind them was the profit motive , and not the wellbeing of future generations .  
Innovative research , such as that which contributed such key concepts to current development thinking as sustainable human development ( SHD ) and global public goods will be strengthened ;  
That was why the European Union supported the debt cancellation measures for heavily indebted poor countries decided on under the enhanced HIPC initiative , which aimed to cut their debts to a sustainable level .  
Was aware that sustainable energy policy interventions can make important contributions to economic welfare , to social welfare , and to protecting the local , regional and global environment ;  
Endorse the core set of indicators thus developed as a valuable starting point for countries that may wish to organize and elaborate their own national programmes for the testing , development and use of national level indicators of sustainable development ;  
Basic human services must not be destroyed ; subsidies and transfers necessary to guarantee humane minimum standards for the poor must be maintained ; and funds needed for sustainable economic recovery must be set aside .  
There is a pressing need for a substantial increase in the level of funding and its effective use to coordinate coherent and sustainable approaches to statistical capacitybuilding .  
For countries mainly indebted to private foreign creditors , a primary goal of solutions to debt-servicing crises is sustainable borrowing from international financial markets under normal terms of access .  
The focus of this dialogue will be aligned with the issues that are on the agenda of this meeting , that is , need for a global partnership to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , reconfirming the need for an integrated and strategically focused approach to the implementation of Agenda 21 and addressing the main challenges and opportunities faced by the international community in this regard .  
Underlining the importance of the World Summit on Sustainable Development 24 / to be held in 2002 to review the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development , to reinvigorate the global commitment to sustainable development and , as a critical opportunity to advance international cooperation for sustainable development on the basis of concrete commitments at the highest level ,  
Decides that the next session of the Governing Council / Global Ministerial Environment Forum should undertake in depth discussion of the report with a view to providing its input on future requirements of international environmental governance in the broader context of multilateral efforts for sustainable development to the tenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory body for the World Summit on Sustainable Development at its meeting at the Ministerial level in May 2002 as a contribution to the World Summit on Sustainable Development ;  
In conclusion , we hope that todays very broad discussion with the family of United Nations organs and agencies , relevant institutions and Member States will be a step forward to the successful implementation of a fully integrated and broad-based subregional approach aimed at addressing the multifaceted problems confronting the region and promoting durable peace and sustainable development in West Africa .  
We wish to design the strategic guidelines for the development of East Timor as the most effective means to correctly allocate both human and material resources and to obtain genuine sustainable development for the newly emerging independent nation .  
It is imperative that the international community continue to provide technical and financial assistance and to assist the people of East Timor in creating an enabling environment for sustained economic growth and sustainable development .  
A genuine and sustainable peace can be achieved only when proper living conditions are insured for all our inhabitants and when there is a sufficient level of economic development for everyone to meet his basic needs , when fundamental human rights are respected and when social and political differences are resolved through democratic channels .  
I would note , however , that although there is clearly an urgent need for demonstrable progress in this area and we know that this issue of return is of key symbolic and political importance it remains UNMIKs and our firm policy that return should take place in secure and sustainable conditions .  
To do this , we need to address four major objectives : first , consolidate the secure and stable environment that presently exists ; secondly , steer East Timor through the creation of democratic institutions and successful , peaceful elections ; thirdly , put in place the building blocks for the management of public finances and policy-making ; and fourthly , establish the framework for a sustainable and effective Government administration .  
The continued commitment and patience of the East Timorese and the confirmed strong support of the international community will be essential during this complex period and beyond independence if East Timor is to have a sustainable and democratic future .  
In the declaration it adopted at the Summit meeting in September of last year , the Council reaffirmed its determination to give equal priority to the maintenance of international peace and security in every region of the world , while paying special attention to the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , in view of the special needs of the continent and the specific characteristics of the conflicts raging on its territories .  
The overall goal is to find what Mr . Brahimi called a home-grown solution one which is credible , legitimate and sustainable and leads to a broad-based Government which is responsible , representative , stable and accountable ; enjoys both internal and external stability ; respects the human rights of the Afghan people ; and will never again allow the country to be used as a breeding ground for terror or drug trafficking .  
The year 2004 could be seen as a target year by which time concrete progress should have been made in the identification and elaboration of issues of direct concern to families and in the provision of practical guidelines for national , regional and global actions as part of a sustained long-term effort to strengthen the economic and sustainable livelihood of families .  
In my report to the Security Council , I underscored the need for a viable and sustainable financial mechanism and noted that a financial mechanism based on voluntary contributions will not provide the assured and continuous source of funding required for the operation of the Special Court ( S / 2000 / 915 , para .  70 ) .  
Governments , relevant United Nations agencies , Bretton Woods institutions and civil society organizations ( including unions , the private sector , mass media and universities ) should all be actively involved in identifying the most effective ways to achieve sustainable social outcomes for children .  
Its innovative programmes in the field of sustainable development , for example the BIOTRADE initiative and the greenhouse gas emission trading rights programme , could sow the seeds of a future development model featuring economic growth compatible with life , human values and nature .  
UNFPA is also working collaboratively with key United Nations agencies and other relevant partners in the follow-up to UNCED through the Task Manager system , including global initiatives in the areas of basic social services , ageing , gender , youth , health , human rights , education , HIV / AIDS , food security and sustainable development to highlight the linkages between population and reproductive health , a higher quality of life , poverty reduction and the provision of an enabling environment .  
The main challenge lies both for developed and developing countries in the development , utilization and dissemination of renewable energy technologies , such as solar , wind , ocean , wave , geothermal , biomass and hydro power , on a scale wide enough to significantly contribute to energy for sustainable development .  
In order to promote energy for sustainable development there is a need for favourable access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , in particular to developing countries , through supportive measures that promote technology cooperation and that enable transfer of necessary technological know-how as well as building up of economic , technical and managerial capabilities for the efficient use and further development of transferred technology .  
The Working Group underlined the importance to realizing the right to development of strengthening good governance at the national level including through building effective and accountable institutions for promoting growth and sustainable human development , while recognizing of course that responsibility for determining and implementing good governance practices rests with the State concerned .  
The first was the need to preserve outer space exclusively for peaceful purposes and to promote international cooperation for such purposes , the objective being to achieve continued economic growth and sustainable development for all countries , in particular the developing countries .  
In that sense , Peru endorsed the United Nations Programme on Space Applications but believed that the measures covered by the Programme could be carried out only through effective international cooperation based on access to technology , the elaboration of specific projects for space activities and the transmission of processed information that would have a practical and direct effect on the sustainable development of States . 
The work of the Conference was organized around three technical committees , established to deal with a range of specific issues pertinent to cartography , surveying , land management , GIS technology and spatial data infrastructure in support of sustainable development , as defined by an agenda item of the Conference .  
The focus of this dialogue will be aligned with the issues that are on the agenda of the fourth preparatory committee meeting that is , need for a global partnership to achieve the objectives of sustainable development , reconfirming the need for an integrated and strategically focused approach to the implementation of Agenda 21 , and addressing the main challenges and opportunities faced by the international community in this regard .  
The importance that regional workshops undertaken within the Framework be accompanied by concrete and sustainable subregional and national activities , as well as by training and awareness programmes for government officials and key professional groups such as the police , prison officials , educators , judges , lawyers , and parliamentarians , was also recognized .  
For developing countries , official development assistance ( ODA ) is a main source of external funding , and substantial new and additional funding for sustainable development and the implementation of Agenda 21 will be required .  
The Commission could emphasize that the Earths atmosphere must be considered , with the oceans and the land surface , as one of the three basic interacting domains that comprise the global life-support system , and that sustainable development is inextricably linked with the impact that variations in the atmosphere itself can have on human activity , ecosystems and natural disasters . 
It was generally agreed that it is important for countries to establish an enabling environment at both the international and domestic levels in order to promote sustainable development , including economic growth , social development and environmental protection .  
Monitoring the implementation of sustainable development goals through the assessment of data collected at the national , regional and international levels is one of the main objectives of the Division for Sustainable Development . 16 As decided by the Commission on Sustainable Development in 1993 , the Division invites Governments and organizations to submit the relevant information to the Commission . 
In 1997 , the General Assembly recommended that the Commissions approved programme of work on sustainable development indicators result in a practicable and agreed set of indicators , suited to country-specific conditions , including a limited number of aggregated indicators .  
Representatives of national councils on sustainable development who met at a forum , organized in conjunction with the eighth session of the Commission would have welcomed a longer lead time and more thorough regional consultations in advance of the meeting to consolidate better their respective positions on the issues considered at the Commission .  
The further implementation of Agenda 21 is still impaired by insufficient clarity at the conceptual level and insufficient integration of the social , economic and environmental aspects of sustainable development .  
Reaffirming that alternative development as a process to prevent and eliminate the illicit cultivation of plants containing narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances by adopting rural development measures that are specifically designed for that purpose and that are carried out in the context of sustained national economic growth and sustainable development efforts in countries taking action against drugs , recognizing the particular socio-cultural characteristics of the target communities and groups , within the framework of a comprehensive and permanent solution to the problem of illicit drugs ,  
Within that global objective , the Commission would concentrate on six areas of comparative advantage : trade and development ; regional integration and cooperation ; macro-economic policies linked with poverty reduction strategies , in particular the strengthening of social sectors such as health and education ; reliable and sustainable transport ; food security and sustainable rural development strategies ; and institutional capacity-building , good governance and the rule of law .  
The leaders attach special importance to the subject of Arab economic integration and are establishing measures to promote this aspect of joint Arab action so as to achieve a link between shared interests and mutual benefits , as well as strengthen the economic capabilities of their States by adopting an Arab plan that will enable the achievement of full sustainable development and increase joint economic action through positive interaction with the realities of the global economy and the phenomenon of globalization .  
The objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the LDCs and ultimately to put LDCs on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .  
Through its constructive partnerships with Government authorities and civil society at the local and national levels , the Human Rights Division of UNOA is actively helping to create sustainable mechanisms and processes that contribute to enabling institutions to protect human rights and for Angolans to know and exercise them .  These partnerships involve various activities and projects that are almost exclusively funded through voluntary contributions .  
Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources , in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation , and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms , as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms , combating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
The role of developing countries in establishing or enhancing favourable conditions for a sustainable enabling environment for both domestic and international investments , including improving the legal , economic and social environment for investment .  
This will require the operationalization by all relevant actors of common policy goals set out in the international development targets and the Millennium Declaration agreed to by all United Nations Member States , and , when possible , common country approaches and strategies based on developing countries national priorities and development plans , including strategies for sustainable development .  
The high-level international conference should issue a political declaration expressing a firm political will and an undertaking on the part of all governments and of the entire international community to take collective action in addressing the issue of financing to ensure sustainable development for all .  The conference should define the political principles to be applied at both the national and the international level , as well as the collective objectives and goals to be attained and the means needed to accomplish this .  
The provision of increased financial resources , inter alia , through innovative approaches , as well as technical assistance and transfer of environmentally sound technology at the international and national levels , was highlighted in the final report of IFF . 8 It was also stated that such support is particularly needed for capacity-building , and for creating participatory and innovative mechanisms for financing sustainable forest management . 
Also emphasizes the need for new financial flows to debtor developing countries from all sources , in addition to debt relief measures that include debt cancellation , and urges creditor countries and the international financial institutions to increase concessional financial assistance on favourable terms , as a means of supporting the implementation of the economic reforms , combating poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development ;  
Special emphasis on LDCs and assistance in the progressive integration in the global economy by upgrading competitiveness , enhancing productive capacity , stimulating innovations and increasing the level of incomes through a process of industrialization that is compatible with sustainable development ;  
Aware also that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that the eradication of poverty in developing countries depends on the implementation of policies directed towards conservation and the sustainable use of biological resources ,  
Political environment : It was broadly acknowledged that conflict prevention and resolution and good governance ( including a reliable , effective , and transparent legal and administrative system ) are indispensable elements for sustainable and people-centered development .  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
The key tasks were : to ensure security during the transitional period and arrangements for East Timors post-independence security ; to establish a credible system of justice in which fundamental human rights are respected ; to achieve a reasonable level of reconstruction of public services and infrastructure ; to establish an administration that is financially sustainable ; and to manage a political transition to independence , culminating in the adoption of a constitution and democratic elections ( see S / 2000 / 738 , para .  68 ) .  
UNTAET essentially faced many challenges with regard to public administration , among which was , first , the rapid establishment of a functioning administrative apparatus within a context of decimated human and material infrastructure , and second , moving East Timorese into positions of responsibility as soon and as much as possible to create a sustainable East Timorese administration ( Timorization ) .  
To do this , we must : ( i ) maintain the integrity of ecosystems and the continued health of the planets life-support system which sustain the productivity , adaptability of renewal of all life ; ( ii ) maintain biological diversity in the variety of life on which ecological processes depend processes that provide a stream of current and future benefits to human beings ; and ( iii ) ensure sustainable population dynamics ( size of population , growth rate and distribution ) , as it often exerts pressures on the environment .  
First , where countries have established or are well on the way to establishing an enabling environment for sustainable development and poverty reduction , including effective public management systems , they can absorb a full range of enhanced assistance , including budget support and predictable long-term commitments , aimed at achieving major development goals .  
Aware that the conservation of wild flora and fauna and of genetic resources is essential for the maintenance of biological diversity and sustainable development , these being of fundamental importance , in particular , for local and indigenous communities with traditional lifestyles based on biological resources , and that concerns have been expressed with respect to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , including technical and economic cooperation among developing countries , represents a viable strategy for developing countries to pursue individually and collectively sustained economic growth and sustainable development and to ensure their participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Urges , in the context of the expansion of the technical and economic cooperation among developing countries modalities , donor countries , the organizations and agencies of the United Nations development system , including regional commissions as well as other development partners to intensify their efforts to support South-South initiatives designed to benefit especially the least developed countries , landlocked developing countries , transit developing countries and small island developing States with a view to expanding their intra-trade and intra-investment opportunities and achieving sustainable development and more equitable integration into the global economy ;  
As development thinking shifts towards sustainable human development and parallel good governance and economic development , South-South initiatives are required to move easily from technical collaboration to joint efforts in social and economic development .  
In conclusion , anti-poverty policies are more likely to be effective , sustainable , inclusive , equitable and meaningful to those living in poverty if they are based upon international human rights .  
The achievement of such consensus and hence the fulfilment of important commitments , including those aimed at bringing about the necessary structural changes for sustainable social and productive development , public participation , strengthening of the political system and modernization of the democratic State could provide the opportunity to reactivate the peace process and make sure that it is irreversible .  
With a view to achieving sustainable development of production , the agreements established the need for legal , institutional and financial reforms in order to consolidate a democratic , inclusive , decentralized and participatory State .  
In the present report , I have stressed that conflict prevention lies at the heart of the mandate of the United Nations in the maintenance of international peace and security , and that a general consensus has emerged among Member States that comprehensive and coherent conflict prevention strategies offer the greatest potential for promoting lasting peace and creating an enabling environment for sustainable development .  
The objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the LDCs and ultimately to put LDCs on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
It requires new investments in regional and national agricultural and fishery research and rural infrastructure , extension of better farming and fishing practices and innovative and sustainable technologies , as well as marketing advice , structured and effective finance and greater tenure security , including access to and control over land by female farmers irrespective of their marital status .  
We request the international community to strongly support poverty eradication , and welcome the ongoing consultations by the Secretary-General on the establishment of a world solidarity fund for poverty eradication to finance and realize , inter alia , the social policies and programmes of the Habitat Agenda to address challenges of poverty eradication and sustainable development in developing countries , especially the least developed countries , bearing in mind the voluntary nature of the contributions .  
The General Assembly may also wish to take note of the decision adopted by the Council of the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) at its last meeting recognizing fully that the issue of land degradation is integral to the pursuit of sustainable development and poverty alleviation and synergies among the global environmental conventions and deciding to designate land degradation ( desertification and deforestation ) as a GEF focal area as a means for enhancing GEF support for the successful implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification .  
We further express our determination to maximize the benefits of globalization with a view to the realization of civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights and the right to development , through strengthening cooperation to create increased opportunities for trade , economic growth and sustainable development , global communications through the use of new technologies and increased intercultural exchange through the preservation and promotion of cultural diversity , which may contribute to the eradication of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance ;  
The Group was convinced that the industrialization strategy developed through the integrated programmes constituted one of the best means of ensuring the sustainable industrial development of developing countries and of alleviating poverty and ensuring productive employment .  
Slovakia fully supported the continuation of UNIDOs successful transformation in order to increase the impact , relevance and usefulness of the Organization in its task of promoting responsible and sustainable industrial development , as a means of achieving economic well-being and social development while ensuring environmental sustainability .  
It sought a partnership between the industrialized and the developing countries and economies in transition in which there would be no losers , creating stable conditions for effective international cooperation to eradicate poverty worldwide and bring sustainable development for all .  
UNIDO should systematize successful experiences and models of sustainable industrial development , taking account of the specific conditions in each country , so that strategic alliances with other international or regional bodies could be established .  
Gravely concerned at the illicit manufacture , transfer and circulation of small arms and light weapons and their excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread in many regions of the world , which have a wide range of humanitarian and socio-economic consequences and pose a serious threat to peace , reconciliation , safety , security , stability and sustainable development at the individual , local , national , regional and international levels , 2 bis .  
The Ministers noted with appreciation enhanced CEI cooperation in the fields of promoting sustainable social , economic and ecological development , infrastructure and private sector investment , SME development , transborder and interregional cooperation ( such as the enhanced Szeged Process ) , human resource development , cultural as well as scientific and technological cooperation ( such as the Italian-Slovenian transfrontier television project ) , including in the field of geodesy , combating organized crime , protection of minorities , womens entrepreneurship and youth affairs .  
In that regard , Finland has actively supported the heavily indebted poor countries ( HIPC ) initiative with the aim to have the developing countries commit themselves to the exercise of sustainable economic policies , alleviation of poverty and respect for human rights in return for a reduced debt burden .  
It is vital to restore North-South dialogue with two fundamental objectives : promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development as the priorities of cooperation and correcting the imbalances in the operation of the international economic system , which places developing countries at a clear disadvantage in their relationship with developed countries .  
The Government of Mexico considers that the international agenda should envisage at least five goals : greater and more effective participation by developing countries in international economic decision-making ; a truly open multilateral trade system reflecting the development needs of all nations ; a new international financial architecture releasing resources for productive investment ; an effective prevention and response capacity to deal with international financial crises ; and sustainable and integrated worldwide economic growth .  
The strategies and guidelines for social policy set out in the National Development Plan include initiatives to reverse the causes of extreme poverty in the shortest possible time and will be sustainable in the long term ; their basic objective is to help to meet the immediate needs of the marginal population and at the same time to support it , within a context of empowerment , so as to expedite its incorporation in productive life , breaking the vicious and inter-generational circle of poverty .  
At the national level , his Group and China supported the following recommendations made by the experts : raising awareness of the role and value of traditional knowledge and its contribution to the development process ; promoting , where appropriate , the commercialization of traditional knowledge-based products and services , involving indigenous and local communities in that endeavour , consistent with the sustainable use of biological resources ; and exploring suitable instruments , including sui generis systems for the protection of traditional knowledge .  
The representative of Lesotho pointed out that in developing countries , local and farming communities had , over the years , developed knowledge systems for the sustainable use of biodiversity , including the selection and breeding of plant varieties for agricultural purposes .  
The Commission had placed emphasis on raising the value of traditional knowledge , on promoting sustainable use of genetic resources , and on ensuring equitable benefit sharing in the commercialization of traditional knowledge based products , and it had recommended that the international community explore minimum standards for an internationally recognized sui generis system . 
The previous report noted that the situation was worsening year by year , and described challenges in the area of sustainable human development resulting from the chronic instability of the countrys political , economic , social and security environment .  
The Plan of Action for the Decade provides for the establishment , upon the initiative of Governments or other relevant institutions , of national focal points or committees for human rights education , which should include a broad coalition of governmental and non-governmental actors and be responsible for developing and implementing a comprehensive , effective and sustainable national plan of action for human rights education .  
The Programme of Action states that the objective of the policy framework is to create an overall enabling environment for national and international actions to eradicate poverty and overcome the structural bottlenecks in the least developed countries and ultimately to put least developed countries on a path of accelerated growth and sustainable development that provides opportunities for all , particularly the poorest , and enables these countries to integrate beneficially into the global economy based on the principle that human beings are at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development .  
As regards FDI and other private external flows , the Programme of Action recognizes that a stable economic , legal and institutional framework is crucial in order to attract foreign investment and to promote sustainable development through investment .  
The national programmes of action identified the difficulties and constraints faced by least developed countries and the required national and international support measures to eradicate poverty , overcome the structural bottlenecks in least developed countries and put these countries on the path of accelerated growth and sustainable development .  
They agreed that it was vital to address the problem in a comprehensive , integrated , sustainable and efficient manner , and recommended a series of practical actions to be taken by OAU member States at the national and regional levels .  
For the majority of the CEE region countries not so affected by direct desertification but faced by land degradation and so on , the major tasks are , inter alia , to establish and maintain the optimum proportions of arable land , meadows , pastures , forests and water areas in accordance with the principles of sustainable development and the capacity of the environment , to decrease over-cultivation of agricultural land through selective afforestation , bio-corridors or establishment of grasslands .  
The Refugee Education Trust , an independent fund established in December 2000 with strong support from United Nations agencies , donors , Governments and non-governmental organizations , is a mechanism designed to provide sustainable post-primary education , motivating refugee children to continue and complete primary schooling in the hope that they may return to their communities as teachers , professionals and leaders after obtaining the necessary skills at the post-primary level . 
Calls upon the international community to seek to make the option of remaining in ones country viable for all people , to which end efforts to achieve sustainable economic and social development , ensuring a better economic balance between developed and developing countries , should be strengthened ;  
The analytical studies confirmed that weak infrastructures and inefficient transit operations result in high transport costs and are major impediments to trade expansion and sustainable development in many landlocked and transit developing countries .  
The Money Matters Institutes mission is to foster dialogue among leaders of financial services , international institutions and policy makers in developing countries to encourage the most realistic role for private capital in financing sustainable development , and to generate the requisite supporting data about emerging economies so as to facilitate this purpose .  
The economic and social problems of the region remained acute and the rate of growth of gross domestic product ( GDP ) required to place Africa on the path of sustainable development had not been attained .  
The United States was committed to continuing and increasing support for sustainable economic growth and human development , accompanied by steady poverty reduction .  
We also draw the attention of the Committee to the initiative put forward to the President of the Russian Federation at the Millennium Summit with regard to ensuring energy supplies for the sustainable development of humankind , a radical solution to the problems posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to the problem of global environmental improvement .  
Reaffirms the commitments made by heads of State and Government at the World Summit for Social Development , contained in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development1 and the Programme of Action , 2 which established a new consensus to place people at the centre of the concerns for sustainable development and pledged to eradicate poverty , promote full and productive employment and foster social integration so as to achieve stable , safe and just societies for all ;  
On the domestic front , his Government had sought to improve the legal and economic instruments of environmental management and to promote a sustainable development by giving priority to investment in pollution prevention and various progressive environmental technologies ; and it would be working to improve the efficiency of the energy sector after accurately assessing the costs involved . 
The forthcoming International Conference on Financing for Development would be instrumental in reshaping the world economic order and making it more equitable , by inter alia , coming up with a sustainable solution to the debt crisis and reforming the international financial architecture .  
The World Summit on Sustainable Development would give the international community a unique opportunity to undertake a holistic and realistic assessment of the real challenges in the field of sustainable development and devise effective means to meet those challenges .  
This required revival of global economic growth , in a sustainable and more equitable manner , coupled with open markets and technical assistance for developing countries , and the removal of barriers to free exchange and investment within the developing world .  
The rapid expansion in global energy demand and the growing awareness of the need for sustainable development has put increasing focus on the environmental consequences of burning fossil fuels .  
It is gratifying to note that the Commission on Sustainable Development has recognized the value of nuclear energy in the context of sustainable development and has agreed that the choice to use appropriate energy sources should be left to the countries concerned .  
In my view , the benchmark for a sustainable democracy is the extent to which a State acts in accordance with universal and indivisible human rights : the civil and political rights , as well as the economic , social and cultural rights defined in international human rights law .  
On the subject of the environment and sustainable development , the Group of 77 and China were indeed pleased with the adoption at the first substantive session of the United Nations Forum on Forests of a multi-year programme of work and a plan of action .  They also wished to emphasize the necessity of providing the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification with adequate , predictable and stable financial resources .  
In that regard , the Union had identified the possible main themes for the Summit , which might serve as a preliminary basis for discussion in the future : protection of the natural resources that were the base of economic and social development ; integration of the environment and poverty eradication ; making globalization serve sustainable development ; and improving governance and participation .  
The goal of sustainable development for all required that a solution be found to the debt problem of the developing countries , the liberalization of the trade polices of the industrialized countries be encouraged , especially in sectors of interest to the countries of the South such as agriculture and textiles , the prices for raw materials stabilized , development assistance increased and the transfer of technology promoted , so as to reduce the growing gap between North and South which was the greatest threat to the developing countries .  
The endeavour to reverse the marginalization of developing countries , to promote their sustained economic growth and sustainable development and to facilitate their integration into the world economy had led the international community to search for integral and balanced global arrangements .  
They considered that the lack of access to modern and sustainable energy is a major cause of environmental and health hazards in vast areas of the developing world and a major impediment to quality of life , while recognizing both the fundamental role of energy as the largest component of gross domestic product in several countries and the very rapid changes taking place in that sector . 
Energy is central to achieving the interrelated economic , social and environmental aims of sustainable human development , and energy services play a crucial role in providing efficient access to energy in support of development .  
The issue of sustainable development should be addressed , since increased burning of firewood by the rural population , which lacks access to modern commercial energy , leads to environmental problems .  
Affirm that effective and meaningful public participation of civil society , including international and national non-governmental organizations and the private sector , is an essential component of successful and sustainable social and economic development and an important element for the promotion of human rights ;  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Express their determination to prevent and attenuate the adverse effects of globalization and to develop to the maximum the benefits of globalization by strengthening cooperation , with a view to improving and expanding opportunities for trade , economic growth and sustainable development and , through the use of new technologies , increasing cultural exchanges , thereby preserving and promoting cultural diversity ;  
After surveying Member States to determine the order of priority in which they would classify the various recommendations in the Vienna Declaration on Space and Human Development adopted by UNISPACE III , the Committee had decided to set up 11 open-ended action teams corresponding to recommendations in priority areas that included disaster management , environmental monitoring strategy , management of Earths resources , promotion of sustainable development , space-based navigation and positioning systems , capacity-building and increasing public awareness of the importance of space activities . 
If international cooperation failed to expand , it would be difficult for many developing countries to create a reliable scientific and educational base for the sustainable development of space technology .  
Stressing that the achievement of the national priorities in the political , economic , social , cultural , environmental , public safety and regional integration fields , which are set out in the programme of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America , is essential for reducing the regions vulnerability to natural disasters and for promoting sustainable human development ,  
Recognizes the difficulties of heavily indebted middle-income developing countries in meeting their external debt and debt-servicing obligations , and notes the worsening situation in some of them in the context , inter alia , of greater liquidity constraints , which may require debt treatment through various national and international measures designed to assist those countries in making their debt burden sustainable in the long term and in combating poverty effectively ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment of interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and welcomes the efforts made to implement the 20 / 20 initiative , which emphasizes that promoting access for all to basic social services is essential for sustainable and equitable development and is an integral part of the strategy for the eradication of poverty ;  
The organization developed an approach using lay people to develop indicators for sustainable development ; public round tables were held , and long-term thinking was encouraged .  
Recognizing the importance of continuing international support to the national efforts of the Governments and civil societies of Belarus , the Russian Federation and Ukraine , as the most affected countries , to mitigate and minimize the persisting negative effects of the Chernobyl disaster on the sustainable development of the affected areas as a result of the radiological , health , socio-economic , psychological and environmental consequences of the disaster ,  
The international community ought therefore to help poor new democracies like Nepal to accelerate their sustainable economic development and social progress and thus help their quest to consolidate democratic polity , human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
Recognizing that the main role of UNIDO lies in providing technical cooperation to the developing countries , in particular the least developed countries , and the countries with economies in transition , in relation to those support functions in which the Organization has a competitive advantage , such as strengthening of industrial capacities and cleaner sustainable industrial development and also giving assistance to those countries to participate effectively in international trade ,  
Encourages all States , the United Nations system and other actors to take advantage of the International Year of Freshwater to raise awareness of the strategic importance of achieving sustainable development and use of the freshwater resources of the world , which are essential for satisfying basic human needs , health and food production , economic and social development and the preservation of ecosystems , and to assign high priority to the formulation and implementation of action-oriented policies and programmes for the sustainable use of freshwater for social and economic purposes ;  
Recognizes the difficulties of heavily indebted middle-income developing countries in meeting their external debt and debt-servicing obligations , and notes the worsening situation in some of them in the context , inter alia , of greater liquidity constraints , which may require debt treatment through various national and international measures designed to assist those countries in making their debt burden sustainable in the long term and in combating poverty effectively ;  
Reaffirms the importance of agreeing on a mutual commitment of interested developed and developing country partners to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget , respectively , to basic social programmes , and welcomes the efforts made to implement the 20 / 20 initiative , which emphasizes that promoting access for all to basic social services is essential for sustainable and equitable development and is an integral part of the strategy for the eradication of poverty ;  
Stressing also that there is a need for an enabling national and international environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Urges the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , poverty eradication , provision of basic social services , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of young people , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , the needs of local indigenous communities , political freedom , popular participation and respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
Recognizes that the overall thrust of the new strategic vision of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements ( Habitat ) and its emphasis on the two global campaigns on secure tenure and urban governance are strategic points of entry for the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , especially for guiding international cooperation on adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Believe that the strengthening of democratic institutions throughout the Latin American and Caribbean region , the advances made in peace processes in some countries of the region and greater public awareness have helped to incorporate the environmental dimension into the development process and to make people-centred sustainable development the first priority of the political , economic and social programmes of the States of Latin America and the Caribbean .  
Recognize the importance of the transparent and jointly responsible participation of civil society , including the main groups identified in Agenda 21 , in the design , implementation and follow-up of sustainable development policies and of regional and international commitments on these matters , and that it is essential to strengthen the cultural , educational and environmental training base that makes it possible to engage civil society in the achievement of sustainable development .  
Recognize that the viability of sustainable development in the region requires a stable , predictable , open and inclusive international economic system , in which the environmental dimension is acknowledged as an opportunity for investment and trade .  
Recognize also the special needs of regional and subregional ecosystems , including arid and semi-arid , mountain , forest , marine , aquatic and island ecosystems , which are rich and diverse but generally fragile as well , together with the importance of ensuring their conservation , protection and sustainable use .  
Recognize also that indigenous and local communities embodying traditional lifestyles relevant to the conservation and sustainable use of natural resources constitute an important group for the sustainable production and consumption of goods and services , and that they should therefore participate in the design of policies and actions to achieve sustainable development ; that the use and enjoyment of natural resources in the places in which they live should be approached with respect ; and that their knowledge , innovations and practices should be legally protected and that continual feedback which benefits all concerned should thus be established . 
Recognize that gender equality has been fundamental in advancing efforts to achieve sustainable development and that the full participation of women in policy formulation and implementation should be strengthened at the local , national , regional and global levels .  
To promote the reinforcement of open public and private institutions and clearly defined standards that will help all individual and collective actors to forge their own development process and strengthen institutional links among economic , social and environmental policies with the participation of the population , as set forth in Agenda 21 , through national sustainable development councils .  
To promote more efficient ways of addressing the issue of sustainable development in multilateral forums through the use of flexible , suitable mechanisms for rationalizing efforts and the use of resources more fully and through the promotion of synergies among the relevant conventions , as set forth in Agenda 21 , by national sustainable development councils , among others , in order to articulate economic , social and environmental policies with the participation of the population .  
To recommend that the participants in the International Conference on the Financing of Development to be held in Monterrey , Mexico , in March 2002 , address the need to explore innovative and more effective mechanisms for financing the protection of national public goods that afford global benefits and that they propose means of linking the environmental dimension with countries fiscal policies in order to effectively incorporate financial sectors into the effort to achieve sustainable development goals .  
To underline the fact that given the existing complementarities among trade , investment , environmental quality , social well-being , growth , the benefits of the sustainable use of natural resources and the formation of an open and inclusive world economic system , the environmental dimension constitutes an opportunity rather than a barrier to investment and trade .  
To foster cooperation aimed at achieving the conservation and sustainable management of the regions natural ecosystems for the purpose of deepening world commitments to conserve biodiversity in situ and to work to establish sustainable development plans in those ecosystems which incorporate , at the local level , the agreements that figure in all the relevant conventions and that provide for the creation and reinforcement of protected areas and biological corridors and for the promotion of sustainable production activities . 
To underscore the importance of a healthy population for the achievement of sustainable development because of the impact of health on quality of life and productivity levels ; to emphasize the need to devote greater attention to strengthening the health sector , including the improvement of synergy between environment and health policies ; to call upon the international community to assist in strengthening national capacity in this area , bearing in mind the formidable challenges in this sector , notably the increasing prevalence of HIV / AIDS .  
To emphasize that the achievement of sustainable development and the improvement of the quality of life will require more effective integration of environmental , social and economic components of public policies , programmes and projects at the local , national , regional and international levels .  
Welcoming the New Partnership for Africas Development , which embodies a common African vision of the future and a shared conviction of the pressing duty to eradicate poverty and to place African countries , both individually and collectively , on a path of robust growth and sustainable development , thereby fully integrating Africa into the global economy and political system ,  
Recognizing the importance of industrialization as a key element in promoting sustained economic growth and sustainable development in Africa , in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions , as well as the outcomes of major United Nations conferences , and also its role in facilitating efforts for the eradication of poverty through the enhancement of agro-based industries , promotion of competitiveness , productive employment , capacity-building , gender mainstreaming and effective and efficient management systems ,  
Urges the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , poverty eradication , provision of basic social services , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of young people , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , political freedom , popular participation and respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
Stressing also that there is a need for an enabling national and international environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development ,  
Urges the adoption of comprehensive approaches to human resources development which combine , among other factors , economic growth , poverty eradication , provision of basic social services , sustainable livelihoods , empowerment of women , involvement of young people , the needs of vulnerable groups of society , the needs of local indigenous communities , political freedom , popular participation and respect for human rights , justice and equity , all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development ;  
Reiterating that mutually supportive efforts at the national and international levels are imperative in the pursuit of sustainable development , which includes , inter alia , the provision of financial resources and the transfer of technology for the application of cost-effective energy and the wider use of environment friendly , renewable energies ,  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Stressing that South-South cooperation , as an important element of international cooperation for development , offers viable opportunities for developing countries in their individual and collective pursuit of sustained economic growth and sustainable development , in accordance with relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences , and for ensuring their effective and meaningful participation in the newly emerging global economic system ,  
Ensure access for all youth to all types of education , wherever appropriate , providing alternative learning structures , ensure that education reflects the economic and social needs of youth and incorporates the concepts of environmental awareness and sustainable development throughout the curricula ; and expand vocational training , implementing innovative methods aimed at increasing practical skills , such as environmental scouting ( para .  25.9 ( d ) ) ;  
Enhance mass media to spread information about sustainable development issues , specifically ideas for how to make a positive change from the personal to the international scale , and to become an educational tool through channels such as interconnected radio , television and the Internet ;  
The role of science and engineering in the current policy-making process at national and global levels regarding the three pillars of sustainable development social , economic and ecological is insufficient .  
Sixty scientific academies of the InterAcademy Panel on International Issues ( IAP ) in May 2000,5 stressed that scientific , technological and health capabilities can produce substantial progress over the next two decades towards a sustainable human future and that this progress will demand a threefold effort by the scientific and technological community : to promote the use of existing knowledge more widely and effectively ; to generate new knowledge and beneficial technologies ; and to work with Governments , international organizations and the private sector to promote a worldwide transition to sustainability .  
Participants in the World Conference of Scientific Academies , Tokyo , process are encouraged to examine these documents , as they provide a very valuable and detailed picture of the scientific and technological communitys views and commitments on a wide range of issues critical to sustainable development .  
A crucial role in the global governance of sustainable development that has found widespread acceptance since the 1992 Rio Conference has been played by the instrument of authoritative statements based on scientific assessments .  
More generally , science and technology are equally fundamental to pursuing solutions to human health and social issues , ranging from key human health questions such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) to sustainable transportation .  
The international scientific and technological community can provide assistance at the strategic level by contributing to the decision-making cycle in respect of : ( a ) proactively seeking opportunities , generating early warning , and finding new ways of understanding complex interdependent aspects of sustainable development ; ( b ) engaging extensively with policy formulation and implementation , by providing reliable information for setting policy goals ; and ( c ) helping policy evaluation by monitoring implementation , providing assessments of change , learning from experience , and integrating new information .  
Over the next five years , the scientific and technological community is committed to significantly enhancing the active participation of scientists and engineers within : national sustainable development commissions ; all levels of government , as advisers to heads of State , heads of international agencies , parliaments etc . ; and private sector boards of directors . 
Recognizes that the overall thrust of the new strategic vision of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme ( UN-Habitat ) and its emphasis on the two global campaigns on secure tenure and urban governance are strategic points of entry for the effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda , especially for guiding international cooperation in respect of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
Thus , while providing information on the status of the UNCCD process , the reports should also contribute to the strengthening of the institutional and human capacities of national focal points and national coordinating bodies , thereby improving their ability to coordinate the work and to stimulate the further steps required for effective implementation of the UNCCD as an integral part of national efforts to promote sustainable development and global environmental protection .  
In identifying international cooperation as one of the critical social and economic dimensions in the effort to achieve sustainable development , particularly in developing countries , chapter 2 of Agenda 21 underlines the importance of the international economys providing a supportive international climate for realizing environmental and development goals by promoting sustainable development through trade liberalization and making trade and environment mutually supportive ( para .  2.3 ) .  
Although there had , indeed , been progress in raising awareness and in the codification of environmental law , the internal and external conditions were no more favourable for sustainable development than they had been in 1992 : poverty had increased , environmental degradation had worsened and the accelerated pace of globalization was creating problems of sustainability and equity .  
While the Johannesburg agenda was challenging and daunting , it offered a real chance to demonstrate the power of collaboration and to work for the common good , provided that all relevant actors in the United Nations system , Governments , businesses , urban and rural communities , rich and poor countries joined forces to overcome humanitys tremendous challenges and chose the path of sustainable development .  
The sustainable development and environmental protection objectives that the international community had set in Rio were still far from being achieved : environmental degradation continued on a global scale ; poverty remained a source of concern ; the gap between rich and poor countries continued to widen ; and overall consumption , production and pollutant and toxic substance emission practices remained inconsistent with a pattern of sustainable development .  
Tunisia was a signatory of most of the international conventions on environmental protection and had been among the first countries to implement the Rio Summit recommendations at the national level by setting up an institutional and legal framework for protection of the environment , establishing a national sustainable development committee , developing a national Agenda 21 programme and mainstreaming environmental protection into the various economic and social plans . 
He had called for a new solidarity based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibility , in other words allowing for an adequate apportionment of the burden , bearing in mind the special responsibility of some countries which historically had accounted for a large portion of global resource use to ensure that the developing countries had the means for sustainable development .  
Concerning finance , the Ministers had highlighted the importance of meeting the targets for official development assistance , the need to encourage private sector participation in the promotion of sustainable development through appropriate incentives , ensuring that additional funds were available to the Global Environment Facility , the need for debt relief for highly indebted poor countries , and ensuring market access in developed countries for the exports of developing countries .  
Clearly , the preparatory process was already highlighting the concerns of the poor countries with respect to capacity-building , harnessing science for development , transferring technology and the inescapable need to set aside for sustainable development a level of funding in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility through concessional loans or foreign direct investment .  
In the next stages of the preparatory process , the emphasis of the debate would no doubt shift to the relationship between the environment and deepening poverty ; yet the Rio Summit had already exhausted and resolved the issue by stating in Agenda 21 that the economic , social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development were equally important .  
In that regard , it was highly advisable to avoid , during the first substantive session of the Preparatory Committee in January 2002 , perpetuating a culture which would lead either side to establish an unwarranted and inappropriate order of priority among the three pillars of sustainable development , namely , economic growth , social development and environmental protection .  
Poverty , which poses a fundamental challenge to sustainable development in the Arab world , requiring rational utilization of available resources , the creation of a suitable climate for investment both locally and regionally , the establishment of a mechanism of social solidarity at the national level , the achievement of integration among Arab States in various areas and the granting of priority to Arab labour to help curb unemployment and the spread of poverty ;  
Globalization and its consequences , which may limit the possibility of achieving sustainable development in the Arab region , and the need to set up the Arab region in line with its own economic and institutional conditions and create a strong Arab regional bloc based on the regions cultural , civilizational and economic constituents ;  
First : Achieving sustainable development in the Arab world requires the establishment of an integrated , common Arab strategy for improving the economic , social , health and living conditions of the Arab population and preserving the environment in the Arab region that takes into account historical and present conditions in the region and anticipated future changes and world developments with a view to realizing the following objectives :  
Implementing integrated policies for poverty reduction , primarily by facilitating adjustment to economic reform policies , raising professional qualification and general and technical education levels , creating work opportunities for nationals of Arab countries , rationalizing and making proper use of available resources , promoting social solidarity , creating practical solutions to the debt problem and strengthening the role and participation of the private sector and civil society in the formulation and implementation of sustainable development programmes ;  
Encouraging investment in and attracting capital to the Arab region , bearing in mind the social , economic and environmental objectives in sectoral plans , policies and programmes ; fostering new opportunities for bringing about sustainable development ; and limiting adverse effects on health and the environment ;  
An increase in the resources of the Global Environment Facility to match the level of official assistance to developing countries , in view of the Facilitys important role as a basic financing tool for environmental and development activities ; the allocation of more resources to assistance in the implementation of programmes under the relevant multilateral conventions ; the granting of fair and equal opportunities to all developing countries to take advantage of the Facility ; and the simplification of procedures for obtaining from it financing for sustainable development projects ;  
Combining , as appropriate , the increased use of renewable energy sources , more efficient use of energy , the use of advanced fossil fuel technologies and other [ Sustainable ] advanced technologies [ ] [ and nuclear technologies ] and the sustainable use of traditional energy resources , which could meet the growing needs of energy services [ in the longer term ] to achieve sustainable development ;  
Provide a forum for continued policy development and dialogue among Governments , which would involve international organizations and other interested parties , including major groups , as identified in Agenda 21 , to foster a common understanding on sustainable forest management and to address forest issues and emerging areas of priority concern in a holistic , comprehensive and integrated manner ;  
Increased application of United Nations global agreements at the national and local levels , including those within the Istanbul Declaration and the Habitat Agenda that promote sustainable human development in an urbanizing world , capacity-building and institutional development , as well as those included in Agenda 21 and under section 1.7 , Social and economic dimensions , of the Rio Declaration ; 
Implementation of small-scale productive activities , determined and designed by participating institutions , to provide people living in poverty in environmentally sensitive areas with opportunities for income generation through sustainable utilization of local resources .  
Strengthening the institutional and technological capacity to promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development by increasing the ability of policy makers to formulate and implement relevant legislation and environmental management plans ;  
Continuing to make available financial resources from all sources , including new and additional resources on an adequate and predictable basis and technical or other resources and facilitating and financing access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies on favourable terms , including concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , and supporting LDCs efforts in environmental protection in the context of sustainable development ;  
The decentralization that is occurring in many tropical countries can bring benefits to many poor rural people in heavily forested areas , including greater access to forest resources , but weak local technical capacity , limited national support and organizational problems among small-scale loggers undermine prospects for sustainable forest management .
