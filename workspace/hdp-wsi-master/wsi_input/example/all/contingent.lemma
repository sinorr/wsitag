He said that , we should diligently summarize and promote these good experiences , establish a system to encourage competition and diligence and honesty in managing state affairs , and a contingent of national civil servants that regard the serving of the people as their goal , that maintain close links with the masses , that are capable and highly efficient , that are of honest and devoted to their duties , so as to strengthen the vigor and vitality of the government agencies .  
The ideological and political quality , the mental state and the work of cadres at this level have a direct bearing on the implementation of the party 's line , principles and policies , influence local reform , development and stability , and influence party-people and cadre-people relations .  On the whole , the situation of the contingent of the leading bodies and leading cadres of over 2,000 counties ( cities ) across the country is good .  
It is imperative to build up a contingent of ideological and political workers at the grassroots level who maintain a close tie with the masses , care for the well-being of the masses , and are good at doing the mass work .  
Third , we should set a rigid requirement for recruiting judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel and help those who are not suitable for their work to leave .  We should carry out a special task to reform organizations and consolidate those people who have not been recruited in accordance with regulations and who are not suitable for their jobs .  In this way , we can continuously strengthen the invigoration and fighting capacity of the contingent of judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel .  
In light of local situation and their own condition , they should spare no effort in formulating regulations concerning the construction of the grassroots contingent of judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel .  They should set forth their goal , task , and concrete measures .  They should strengthen their leadership over the task .  
The ministry points out that with the focus on improving teachers ' moral characters and work styles , we should realistically strengthen the construction of the contingent of teachers and make ceaseless efforts to improve teachers ' ideological and political quality and professional ability .  
Efforts should be concentrated to eliminate the conspicuous public security problems which take place in and around the campuses of some schools , to deal resolute blows to unlawful activities preventing the youngsters from healthy and sound up-growth , to set up a contingent of outstanding after-school activities counselors , and to actively push primary and middle schools to invite part-time vice presidents and instructors in charge of legal systems .  Schools should strengthen the construction of party , Communist Youth League , and Young Pioneers organizations .  
Last year , it resolutely punished criminal elements who attempted to subvert state power and split the country .  In the struggle against the cult organization " Falungong , " the judicial contingent strictly applied the Criminal Law and relevant judicial explanations and sternly cracked down on criminal activities of organizing and using cult organizations to undermine enforcement of laws , cause deaths , and obtain state secrets illegally .  
In addition , the judicial contingent also tried a number of criminal cases of major impact , sternly punished criminal activities that harmed the order of the market economy , thereby protecting legal rights and interests of various economic sectors in the midst of reform and opening up , and ensuring healthy development of our country 's economy .  
It has set up a number of specialized laboratories for nuclear and chemical protection research and experiments .  It has a high-level contingent of scientists and researchers .  Over the years , it has attained a number of scientific research achievements that are up to advanced world standards in the field of nuclear and chemical protection .  
Comrade Mao Zedong said during the rectification campaign in Yanan : Only when we master Marxism can our contingent be consolidated , can our cadres be enhanced in quality , and can we have the ability to meet and to have control over a future bright world .  
The organization work is an important component part of our democratic and political building ; and to make the party 's organization work to effectively serve the country 's central task of economic construction and to provide both a firm and powerful organizational guarantee and a personnel support for the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , we must adapt the party 's organization work to the needs of the situation , improve work methods , and strive to enhance the quality of both leading bodies and the contingent of cadres .  
The issues of belief and conviction involve many major issues including our guiding thought , social system , cadres ' contingent building , as well as people 's thinking that have a bearing on the rise and fall and success and failure of our party .  Faced with tough challenges in the new millenium , and at a time of comprehensively pushing forward our cause into the new century , we need a strong spiritual force even more .  
Only by paying close attention to building a contingent of qualified personal as a fundamental task will it be possible for us to implement the grand strategy of strengthening our armed forces through science and technology .  
advance toward the target of turning ourselves into well-disciplined young people who have a lofty ideal , a sound moral integrity , and a profound cultural knowledge ; come together to form a mighty contingent of young talents ; and compose a more magnificent song of youth in the new century .  
According to the requirements for improving quality , optimizing structures , and pulling the efforts of both full-time and part-time workers , we should set up a contingent of ideological and political workers who have political integrity , professional ability , a strict sense of discipline , and correct work styles .  
Relevant military and civilian personnel generally think that frequent exercises not only have rigorously trained the front-support contingent participating in sea battles , but also have strengthened the military-government and military-people relationships in coastal regions and raised the national defense awareness of the masses in these regions .  
Various logistical supports have also been strengthened .  At present , our reserve forces ' rapid mobilization capability and fighting ability have been greatly improved .  Reserve forces have become a strong contingent of the armed forces of our country .  
In addition , we should firmly uphold the concept that " our cause is of utmost importance " and adhere to the principle of training cadres who have both ability and political integrity and the principle of making our cadre contingent more revolutionary , younger in average age , better educated , and more competent professionally .  The party 's line and policy concerning cadres should be fully and properly carried out , and the established standard should be strictly complied with in selecting and promoting young cadres .  
Third , cadre appointments must be based on the principle of incorruptibility .  Outstanding candidates selected through democratic procedures and proved to be honest and upright in their behavior by the assessment of the organization should be appointed to key positions without hesitation so that they may play a exemplary and guiding role in the cadre contingent and encourage all cadres to maintain the spirit of working hard in making progress .  
Over the past several years , the unit has trained an outstanding contingent of professional backbone personnel for sea transportation ; has become capable of fulfilling sea transportation tasks under all sorts of complex conditions ; and has successfully accomplished sea training or sea support tasks on countless occasions .  
In the bill calling for examination and deliberations , State Council Premier Zhu Rongji and Central Military Commission Chairman Jiang Zemin stated : Since coming into force , the " Regulations " has played a key role in further revolutionizing or rendering our army 's officers ' contingent younger in average age , more knowledgeable , or more professional and in mobilizing enthusiasm or creativity on the part of the broad masses of officers as well .  
The minimum length of service of officers in peacetime has been stipulated and the upper age limit for the active service of officers ranking at the level of principal regiment commander has been relaxed , so as to give better play to the role of talent and improve the stability of the officer contingent .  
Leaders and Party commissions at all levels should pay greater attention to the construction of ranks of high-quality military professionals , set up and complete a mechanism of cultivating , attracting , using and encouraging these professionals , and strive to build up a contingent of high-quality military professionals within a reasonable structure , a sufficiently large number of these people and a scientific configuration .  These people should provide a powerful personnel and intellectual guarantee for satisfactory preparation for the military struggle in the new period and thus accelerate military modernization construction .  
They should train and bring up a contingent of high-quality leaders of different types at various levels who are firm in their political stand , manifest new pioneering spirit and possess modern scientific , educational and managerial knowledge as well as a contingent of specialty technicians and economic managerial personnel urgently needed in our region .  
- - Building a contingent of highly qualified instructors and training a batch of qualified personnel specializing in various disciplines for higher levels .  Various units charged with the task of building key projects have all along taken training a rationally structured contingent of highly qualified instructors as the focus of their principal endeavors ; have mapped out or implemented a series of policy measures for absorbing or training qualified personnel for higher levels ;  
In recent years , relevant mass organizations such as various democratic parties and associations of industry and commerce have gradually experienced political transitions where new leading members have replaced old ones , united and mutually beneficial national relations have been further consolidated , and major progress has been made in relations between religion and socialist society ; the most fundamental reason for all of this is that a high-quality contingent of non-party leaders has been cultivated .  
China fully put into play the extensive knowledge of its vast satellite engineering contingent .  Under fairly poor conditions , we constantly attacked key technologies , scoring a series of major achievements in satellite engineering , and at the same time constantly perfecting and strengthening all kinds of fundamental work in satellite engineering .  
Article 37 All units shall do a good job in selecting , assigning , training , or appointing military scientific research personnel ; introduce or refine an incentive mechanism ; give full scope to enthusiasm or creativity on the part of research personnel ; and work hard to build a high-quality contingent of military scientific research personnel , including both full-time and part-time personnel , who are known for political integrity , professional proficiency , a rigorous style , and a rational structure .  
Now that the case has been cracked within a short period of time , this has once again borne out that our public security contingent is one capable of fighting a tough battle and one worthy of the trust of the party and the people and deserving such a title as a strong shield of the republic .  
An important experience we have accumulated in administrating military units at grass-roots level lies in sticking to " one group and two contingents . "  Practice has shown that every military unit with a solid contingent of party members is strong .  This unit can stand forward at crucial moments and confront difficulties and dangers .  
The party organization of this unit is strong in uniting and inspiring people .  Now that party members account for a considerable percentage of the military and armed police forces , if this contingent is satisfactorily administered , we will provide a solid foundation for the party 's absolute leadership over the military and provide a reliable guarantee for assuring the completion of every task .  
It is very difficult see the embodiment of the advanced nature in party members like these .  Promoting this educational campaign for maintaining the advanced nature of party members is of great significance for implementing the requirement of focusing the minds of party members on the correct theory , spurring the real work of the military , solving existing problems in the contingent of party members , advancing the military 's party-building in the new period and pushing forward the military modernization construction .  
This is certainly not saying something frightening just to scare people .  In doing a good job in rural work , we must not only depend on correct theory , line , guidelines , and policies , but also on a rural grassroots cadre contingent of a quality capable of withstanding severe tests , with good ideological and work style , and genuinely bent on pursuing the masses ' interests .  
It is necessary to transform work style , practice the leadership accountability system , ensure that all work measures are in place , and gain new and marked achievements in public order work ; we must succeed in markedly lowering the crime rate , improving the public order precautionary setup , further strengthening the masses ' sense of security , markedly improving the all-round quality of the political-legal contingent , and achieving a big improvement in judicial backup work .  
To carry out the struggle to " strike hard " and put things , it is necessary to build a contingent of political and legal workers into a strong contingent of political and legal workers who are up to standard in politics , highly disciplined , perfect in work styles , proficient in professional work , and firm in administering justice .  
and have a full range of technical means for law-enforcement .  Sixth , we must revise and perfect relevant laws and regulations , build a stronger law-enforcement contingent , and improve the level of law-enforcement .  A task of top priority is to conscientiously tackle the outstanding problem that the law is neither fully observed nor enforced .  
At the same time , comprehensive auditing will be conducted and strengthened in the fields of budgetary management , equipment , capital construction , reform items , and the enforcement of economic and financial discipline .  The internal auditing institutions will be improved and reinforced .  Efforts will be made to build a high-quality contingent of auditors who work honestly , diligently , and efficiently .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirement of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up the building of our ranks , constantly improve the ideological and political quality , the scientific and cultural level , and the professional skills of party-member cadres , and train and bring up a contingent of high-quality party-member cadres .  
We must build , in accordance with the requirement of " enforcing laws strictly and rendering warmhearted service " that was set by General Secretary Jiang , our contingent of political and legal workers into a strong contingent of political and legal workers who are up to standard in politics , highly disciplined , perfect in work styles , proficient in professional work , and firm in administering justice .  
She pointed out that the achievements gained in the customs ' scientific and technological work are the results of the exploration and innovation made by the vast number of customs ' scientific and technological personnel as well as their selfless dedication .  The advanced customs scientific and technological collectives and individuals who were commended today are the outstanding representatives of the contingent of scientists and technicians .  They are the invaluable human resources of the customs sector and deserve the commendation and handsome rewards .  
As an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation noted , the motherland is rich in resources and has a vast market that is full of potential .  It also has an abundant supply of labor , low wages , cheap land , a huge contingent of scientific and technological personnel , and an industrial productive system that is complete in range and large in scale .  
Doing a good job in selecting and promoting female cadres and recruiting more female party members is a need in our efforts to fulfill the new tasks under the new situation , to meet the " three represents " requirement , and to build a strong high-quality cadre contingent and to reinforce the party rank and file , and is also an important component part of our work in developing socialist democratic politics and promoting social progress .  
Under a huge banner with a slogan , " Emulate Wang Wei 's spirit and toughen the strong amphibious contingent , " officers and men of the " hard bone sixth company " carried out the most practical and lively education in fostering lofty ideals and conviction .  
The important thinking of " three represents " has provided scientific theoretical guidance to building a contingent of army cadres , so we must put into effect this important thinking in a comprehensive way in the training and selection of cadres to guarantee that the barrels of guns are always held in the hands of the reliable persons loyal to the party .  
Therefore , to ensure that our contingent of army cadres is on the mark politically is the top priority for upholding the principle of the party 's absolute leadership over the army , which has a direct bearing on the prosperity or decline and success or failure of the party 's cause , the prolonged peace and stability of the country , and the overall requirement that the army is " capable of winning the battle " and " will not become morally degenerate . "  
It is especially necessary to take effective policy measures to build and develop a contingent of high-level personnel and versatile personnel who can meet the needs of the new period , with the focus on training and absorbing capable personnel for making innovations , management and operation and on further creating a favorable environment for capable personnel who have returned from studying abroad to do pioneering work .  
Third , the reserve cadre contingent was strengthened to a new degree .  According to the working guideline of " replenishing leading bodies and strengthening reserve force , " through the procedures of democratic recommendation and strict evaluation by the party organizations , outstanding young cadres were added to the reserve cadre contingents at various levels .  These promising young cadres have good political quality and strong work ability , and they are now selected as candidates for leading positions at a higher level .  
It is necessary to continue the activities of creating judicial organs that satisfy the people and being judicial officers who satisfy the people so that the judicial administrative contingent at the grass-roots level will be built into a strong force that is politically up to standard , keeps a strict sense of discipline , maintains a good work style , become more proficient professionally , and enforces laws rigorously .  
Thanks to all these efforts , batches after batches of high-end cadres with high educational backgrounds have been recruited into the military , and have gradually become a main force in the contingent of cadres of our army .  However , there still exists a wide gap between our army and foreign armies in the cultivation of high-quality talent .  For example , officers holding master 's degree and above make up a relatively low proportion in our army ;  
most cadres are deficient in combined capabilities and have a relatively poor scientific and technological quality ; and in particular , there is a shortage of top-notch technological personnel .  It is just as Chairman Jiang has pointed out : " At present , the quality of the cadres contingent of our army has yet to totally suit the demands of our military strategic requirements for the new period , and this is an issue that has to be settled urgently . "  
We must conduct a law-enforcement inspection drive while carrying out the struggle to strike hard and put things in order , make a special endeavor to resolve the pronounced problems facing the contingent of political and legal workers , resolutely purge the tiny number who have brought disgrace to the contingent , and vigorously commend and foster advanced models .  
This professional contingent of helpers and educators are required to hold themselves responsible for the party and the people , enjoy a profound understanding of policy as well as a fairly high theoretical level , have an intimate knowledge of the harms of the evil cult , understand the mentality of " Falungong " practitioners , and are good at doing a patient and painstaking ideological and political work .  
Referring to the situation where cadres still lack a democratic and legal system , the 13th Party Congress consequently proposed to regard the establishment of a state public functionary system as the focus for reforming the personnel system of cadres to conduct scientific management of the contingent of cadres according to law ; thus transforming the previous outdated unitary management pattern and allowing the establishment of a new-type personnel system of cadres based on the principles of attaching importance to solid performance , encouraging competition , and exercising democratic and separated supervisions .  
To carry out Chairman Jiang 's important directive on striving to construct a contingent of high-quality cadres , the General Department of Staff and the General Political Department decided to , starting this year , replace the old system of directly promoting excellent soldiers to the officer level with a new system in which particularly excellent soldiers are selected to be sent to military academies or universities .  These soldiers can be promoted if they pass an examination at the end of the training program at academies or universities .  
Recently , " Nanfang Zhoumo " , a weekend magazine in Guangzhou , was " purged " on a large scale because its reportage deviated from the standards laid down by the central authorities .  The contingent of editors and reporters was changed substantively .  The leading body of the editorial office was changed ; several editors and reporters were dismissed or disciplined ; other editors and reporters had to be reexamined and reassessed .  
Without such a guide , the revolutionary contingent would still be disunited and weak , could hardly realize its objectives as planned , and may even lose their way and digress towards the wrong direction , despite the enormous potentiality to change the current situation and the relatively mature revolutionary situation .  
It is necessary to deeply study and implement Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " , conduct more intensive education on the correct world and life outlook and correct values among law enforcement and police officers and judicial personnel , and make greater effort to build a high-quality law enforcement contingent with firm political stand , profession proficiency , good work style , and noble moral standards of being honest and uncorrupt  
The brigade 's new equipment is technology intensive and requires complicated operations .  In connection with this reality , the brigade made the training of a contingent of personnel capable of tackling key scientific and technological problems a core issue in resolving training problems and the improvement of quality and performance an important way to shortening the cycle for transforming new equipment into combat strength .  
During the entire course - - from testing , launching , organizing , and directing to technical support - - participants served both as instructors and students and tackled one key problem after another .  They not only successfully accomplished the live ammunition launching mission but also blazed a new trail for teaching special theories in operating new equipment and training .  In addition , it has tempered the backbone contingent .  
Fourth , carry forward the spirit of science and democracy , enliven academic thinking .  Continue to carry out the " double-hundred policy , " encourage creative thinking , create a benign academic environment , discover and foster a large batch of outstanding young scientists , build a strong contingent of scientists and technologists with sufficient quantity and high quality , encourage them to scale up the peaks of science and technology and to occupy a position for our country in the high-tech realm of the world .  
To meet the requirements of the " three represents , " we should implement , in an all-round manner , the principle of fostering a contingent of more revolutionary , younger , better educated and professionally more competent cadres and that of giving equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity .  We should deepen the reform of the personnel system so as to produce a contingent of high-caliber cadres who are capable of assuming important responsibilities and withstanding the test of trials and tribulations .

We should deepen the reform of personnel system so as to produce a contingent of high-caliber officials who are capable of assuming important responsibilities and withstanding the test of trials and tribulations .  
Overall , the contingent of staff of industrial and commercial administration departments we have today is good and a batch of excellent law enforcers who are brave to enforce the law , defy violence and brute force , and do not hesitate to lay down their lives have come to the fore .  
make great efforts to build a contingent of high-caliber cadres in accordance with the guiding principle of fostering a contingent of more revolutionary , younger , better educated , and professionally more competent cadres and the principle of attaching equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity ;  
The exhibition has also received favorable comments from various circles .  With deep feeling for the party , the entire contingent of working personnel has worked very hard in the past few months , displaying a strong sense of devotion to their work and a strong sense of responsibility .  I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks and sincere regards to you .  
He stressed that , under the party 's leadership , the vast numbers of Chinese intellectuals - - who are loyal to the motherland and the people , who are dedicated to working hard for the revitalization of the motherland and the happiness of the people , and who work with the scientific attitude of seeking truth and breaking new grounds and with the precious quality of scaling the heights - - are a contingent of personnel who have withstood tests , accomplished a great deal of work , and are totally trustworthy .  
They are required to build up qualified party branches ; and foster a contingent of cadres and backbone members who enjoy a strong devotion to their work , a sound work style , a fine quality , and a good ability to make innovations .  
Over the past 20-odd years , the Chinese Government has overcome various difficulties .  It has successfully transformed a contingent of leading cadres who were quite old and whose educational levels were quite low into another contingent of leading cadres who are " relatively young " and " knowledgeable . "  Immediately afterward , it has vigorously launched another round of reform in the systems governing cadres and personnel which aims to be more democratic in the process of hiring officials .  
give ever wider publicity to and strengthen theoretical research in comprehensive management of public security , gradually establish and perfect a spending support mechanism , vigorously strengthen the building of the contingent of workers engaged in comprehensive management of public security , improve work styles in real earnest , and make sure that the various measures for comprehensive management of public security are implemented down to village ( residential ) households and individuals .  
we must comprehensively implement the principle of fostering a contingent of more revolutionary , younger , better educated , and professionally more competent cadres and that of giving equal importance to both professional competence and political integrity , deepen the reform of personnel system , and strive to produce a contingent of high-caliber cadres capable of assuming important responsibilities and withstanding the tests of trials and tribulations ;  
By recruiting qualified personnel from the public and reinforcing its professional contingent , the government is bound to drastically alter its way of thinking , way of doing things , and service quality and this will give a forceful impetus to Hong Kong 's robust economic recovery and help turn Hong Kong into an international commercial metropolis .  
The central leadership holds that the appointments of new principal leaders to the State Sports General Bureau are proper , and the new leaders can support each other with their own strong points .  Zhang Bolin also put forward some requirements for the future work of the State Sports General Bureau : Enhance the sense of political responsibility , continue to advance the reform and development of sports ; consolidate and expand the results of " three stress " education , do a good job in party building and contingent building ;

Third , we must work hard to build up a contingent of high-quality community workers ; and while giving full play to the role of existing committee cadres , we should also adopt effective measures to promptly replenish the contingent of community cadres .  Particularly , we should promote to the leading posts of communities a number of outstanding young cadres who have sound political qualities , a fairly high educational level , and a relatively strong work ability and who love the community work , so as to enhance the vigor and vitality of community leading bodies .  
He said : Our contingent of professional literary and artistic workers is the backbone force in our country 's cultural building while the fine works can reflect in a centralized way both the epochal spirit and cultural standard of a country . 
Fourth , the building of the contingent of minority cadres should be intensified , the sources of grassroots cadres in the minority areas should be expanded in a planned way , and the practical problems in cadre building should be conscientiously resolved to stabilize the rank of grassroots cadres . 
The party and the government attach great importance to economic development and social progress in areas inhabited by ethnic minority , and attach great importance to training and fostering a contingent of ethnic minority cadres with both moral integrity and ability , taking this as a major measure for safeguarding the unity of the motherland , realizing national regeneration and the common prosperity of all ethnical groups .  
At the same time , marked results were achieved in developing the contingent of ethnic minority leading cadres .  A large number of ethnic minority cadres with high political quality and courage for doing pioneering work were selected and appointed to leading posts at various levels .  
It is necessary to strive to cultivate an ideological and political contingent that is politically strong , that is professionally competent , that has strict discipline , and that is correct in work style to support their work , to show care in their daily life , to raise their quality , and to even better give play to their roles .  
It is necessary to build a contingent of ideological and political workers who are politically strong , professionally competent , highly disciplinary , and upright , according to the requirements of improving quality , optimizing the structure , and integrating full-time workers with part-time workers .  
Many comrades have even given their precious lives !  However , when measured by the standard of the requirement of the " three represents , " our police contingent still lags far behind in terms of its political , ideological , and professional quality , as well as in its discipline and work style .  
When analyzing the current ideological status of the police contingent , Luo Gan noted : Today , some of our police officers have had a distorted outlook on the world , life , and values ; with shaken ideals and convictions , some have become increasingly indifferent to the aim of their work but have developed a strong desire for privileges ;  
Luo Gan stressed : We should persistently arm the mind of the vast numbers of public security officers with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping Theory , and the gist of a series of important speeches made by Comrade Jiang Zemin ; constantly enhance their consciousness and firmness in implementing the party 's basic line ; and see to it that the police contingent can always retain its political color of being loyal to the party , to the motherland , to the people , and to the law .  
According to the demands of the CCDI and the Central Commission for Judicial , Procuratorial , and Public Security Work , as revealed by people in the know , after September there will be a cleanup and rectification of the law enforcement contingent aside from the successive announcement of the outcome of major and important cases with an impact .  A large number of discipline violators and unqualified personnel in industrial and commercial administration , taxation , customs , and other departments will be dismissed or laid off .  
The selection of the chief justice will be conducive to building a contingent of high quality judges and establishing a scientific judge system .  According to open , equal , competitive and selective principles , outstanding judges of high quality will be selected and appointed as the chief justice .  
In the historical conditions in which the world is at a big turning point and in which tremendous changes are taking place in China , the key to fulfilling the grand , trans-century objectives set at the 15th CPC National Congress and advancing the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics in an all-round way lies in building a contingent of high-quality cadres who can meet the requirements of the " three represents . "  
For more than 20 years of reform and opening up , especially since the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee , the reform of the personnel system relating to cadres , under the leadership of the party Central Committee , has developed and deepened step by step with the progress of the reform of the economic and political systems , scoring tremendous achievements .  This has provided a systematic guarantee for training a contingent of cadres who can fit in with the needs of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization .  
Jiang Zemin pointed out : We should firmly implement the strategy of rejuvenating the country by applying scientific and technological advances and promoting education , make great efforts to promote scientific and technological innovations and advances , earnestly do a good job in building the contingent of qualified personnel , and provide a powerful motive force for economic development and social progress .  
According to the current conditions in ideological and political work in the state security organs , Xu Yongyue put forward eight measures for reinforcing and improving ideological and political work , strengthening ideal and belief education , building and managing the cadre contingent , and consolidating leading bodies and grass-roots party organizations .  
Wang Zhaoguo emphasized that strengthening the training of young and middle-aged leading cadres among the democratic parties and establishing a contingent of high-caliber cadres of democratic parties is a strategic task with a vital bearing on the overall situation of multiparty cooperation , a basic guarantee for upholding and perfecting the system of multiparty cooperation and system of political consultation under the leadership of the CPC , as well as the pressing need for bringing into play the role of parties participating in the administration of state affairs and an effective measure for further realizing political handover .  
The current national work conference of procuratorial organs on promoting the building of grass-roots procuratorates will play an effective role in further deepening reforms in the procuratorial work , intensifying judicial supervision , guaranteeing fairness in law enforcement , promoting the building of grass-roots procuratorial organs , and bringing into the new century a contingent of high-quality procurators who will live up to the hopes of the party and the people and have a high degree of professional proficiency .  
Wei Jianxing required that party committees at all levels effectively strengthen their leadership over procuratorial work , show a clear-cut attitude for supporting the procuratorial organs in performing their functions , greatly support the activities of being good among the grass-roots procuratorates , help them solve existing problems and difficulties , comprehensively strengthen basic construction at the grass-roots level , greatly promote the personnel and institutional reforms in procuratorial organs , optimize the structure of the procurator contingent , continuously enhance the overall quality of the procurator contingent .  
Xiao Yang said that money worship , hedonism , out-and-out egoism , the concept of special privileges , and some other negative and decadent ideas may certainly affect and corrode the contingent of judges under the current circumstances where the economic strategies at home and abroad are under restructuring and continuous changing and where contradictions and struggles in the ideological arena are getting sharper with each passing day .  
He emphasized in particular the need to strengthen the development of backbone cadres of professional and technical personnel , devote major efforts to train academic leaders and aces in the world frontiers of science and technology , train a large number of top-notch scientists , engineering and technical experts , scientific and technical management experts and other types of experts , and optimize the composition of our contingent of professional and technical personnel so that China can achieve a new leap in its science and technology , including national defense science and technology .  
Remarkable changes have been noticed in the ideological thinking , discipline , and work style of the country 's police contingent ; the unifying force and the competitive effectiveness of the contingent have both been enhanced on a constant basis ; and the vast numbers of public security personnel and police officers have stood the test of severe and complicated struggles , and have made outstanding contribution to safeguarding the state security , to ensuring a sound social and political stability , and to maintaining a stable public order .  
He expressed his concern for the sustainability of China 's medium-term fiscal policies , considering in particular the contingent liability of the financial sector as well as possible expenditures for the social security net , pension funds , infrastructure construction and environmental protection in future .  
We should seize opportunities , and accelerate the pace of upgrading our civil air defense projects .  Within a relatively short time , we should strive to establish and develop an organizational and command system that is unified and highly efficient , a protective engineering system that is rationally structured , a telecommunications and alarm system that is sharp and reliable , a contingent of specialized personnel who are highly competent , an effective system for dispersing the population , and a system for facilitating modern scientific research and cultivating talents .  
In addition , we must strengthen the development of the contingent of cadres and try hard to build a contingent of fiscal and financial cadres who are smart and capable , highly efficient , honest , and pragmatic .  
Organizations under the association should play a more positive role in carrying out grass-roots family planning work in urban and rural areas , ensuring reproductive health , supporting and developing poor areas , rendering community service , and building democracy , the legal system , and spiritual civilization .  In addition , they should cultivate a contingent of high quality association workers , and further expand international exchanges and cooperation .  
The coming five to 10 years will be an important period of China 's economic and social development as well as an important period for the development of the personnel work .  In terms of guiding ideology , the personnel departments at all levels should have a good grasp of the following four aspects : 1 ) A huge contingent of high-quality talents should be built up closely around the theme of economic development and , in particular , high-level talents should be cultivated and absorbed at a faster speed .

Finally , in the smaller translation and editorial units at the United Nations Office at Nairobi and the regional commissions , the total absence of posts at the P-5 level , except those occupied by managers overseeing all conference services at those duty stations , means that all prospects of advancement to the P-5 level of any translator or editor , however competent , is contingent on a transfer to one of the three larger conference centres .

Third , we should set a rigid requirement for recruiting judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel and help those who are not suitable for their work to leave .  We should carry out a special task to reform organizations and consolidate those people who have not been recruited in accordance with regulations and who are not suitable for their jobs .  In this way , we can continuously strengthen the invigoration and fighting capacity of the contingent of judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel .  
In light of local situation and their own condition , they should spare no effort in formulating regulations concerning the construction of the grassroots contingent of judicial , procuratorial , and public security personnel .  They should set forth their goal , task , and concrete measures .  They should strengthen their leadership over the task .

The organization work is an important component part of our democratic and political building ; and to make the party 's organization work to effectively serve the country 's central task of economic construction and to provide both a firm and powerful organizational guarantee and a personnel support for the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , we must adapt the party 's organization work to the needs of the situation , improve work methods , and strive to enhance the quality of both leading bodies and the contingent of cadres .  
The issues of belief and conviction involve many major issues including our guiding thought , social system , cadres ' contingent building , as well as people 's thinking that have a bearing on the rise and fall and success and failure of our party .

Relevant military and civilian personnel generally think that frequent exercises not only have rigorously trained the front-support contingent participating in sea battles , but also have strengthened the military-government and military-people relationships in coastal regions and raised the national defense awareness of the masses in these regions .  
Various logistical supports have also been strengthened .  At present , our reserve forces ' rapid mobilization capability and fighting ability have been greatly improved .  Reserve forces have become a strong contingent of the armed forces of our country .  
In addition , we should firmly uphold the concept that " our cause is of utmost importance " and adhere to the principle of training cadres who have both ability and political integrity and the principle of making our cadre contingent more revolutionary , younger in average age , better educated , and more competent professionally .  The party 's line and policy concerning cadres should be fully and properly carried out , and the established standard should be strictly complied with in selecting and promoting young cadres .  
Third , cadre appointments must be based on the principle of incorruptibility .  Outstanding candidates selected through democratic procedures and proved to be honest and upright in their behavior by the assessment of the organization should be appointed to key positions without hesitation so that they may play a exemplary and guiding role in the cadre contingent and encourage all cadres to maintain the spirit of working hard in making progress .

The minimum length of service of officers in peacetime has been stipulated and the upper age limit for the active service of officers ranking at the level of principal regiment commander has been relaxed , so as to give better play to the role of talent and improve the stability of the officer contingent .  
Leaders and Party commissions at all levels should pay greater attention to the construction of ranks of high-quality military professionals , set up and complete a mechanism of cultivating , attracting , using and encouraging these professionals , and strive to build up a contingent of high-quality military professionals within a reasonable structure , a sufficiently large number of these people and a scientific configuration .  These people should provide a powerful personnel and intellectual guarantee for satisfactory preparation for the military struggle in the new period and thus accelerate military modernization construction .  
They should train and bring up a contingent of high-quality leaders of different types at various levels who are firm in their political stand , manifest new pioneering spirit and possess modern scientific , educational and managerial knowledge as well as a contingent of specialty technicians and economic managerial personnel urgently needed in our region .  
- - Building a contingent of highly qualified instructors and training a batch of qualified personnel specializing in various disciplines for higher levels .  Various units charged with the task of building key projects have all along taken training a rationally structured contingent of highly qualified instructors as the focus of their principal endeavors ; have mapped out or implemented a series of policy measures for absorbing or training qualified personnel for higher levels ;  
In recent years , relevant mass organizations such as various democratic parties and associations of industry and commerce have gradually experienced political transitions where new leading members have replaced old ones , united and mutually beneficial national relations have been further consolidated , and major progress has been made in relations between religion and socialist society ; the most fundamental reason for all of this is that a high-quality contingent of non-party leaders has been cultivated .  
China fully put into play the extensive knowledge of its vast satellite engineering contingent .  Under fairly poor conditions , we constantly attacked key technologies , scoring a series of major achievements in satellite engineering , and at the same time constantly perfecting and strengthening all kinds of fundamental work in satellite engineering .

Now that the case has been cracked within a short period of time , this has once again borne out that our public security contingent is one capable of fighting a tough battle and one worthy of the trust of the party and the people and deserving such a title as a strong shield of the republic .  
An important experience we have accumulated in administrating military units at grass-roots level lies in sticking to " one group and two contingents . "  Practice has shown that every military unit with a solid contingent of party members is strong .  This unit can stand forward at crucial moments and confront difficulties and dangers .  
The party organization of this unit is strong in uniting and inspiring people .  Now that party members account for a considerable percentage of the military and armed police forces , if this contingent is satisfactorily administered , we will provide a solid foundation for the party 's absolute leadership over the military and provide a reliable guarantee for assuring the completion of every task .  
It is very difficult see the embodiment of the advanced nature in party members like these .  Promoting this educational campaign for maintaining the advanced nature of party members is of great significance for implementing the requirement of focusing the minds of party members on the correct theory , spurring the real work of the military , solving existing problems in the contingent of party members , advancing the military 's party-building in the new period and pushing forward the military modernization construction .  
This is certainly not saying something frightening just to scare people .  In doing a good job in rural work , we must not only depend on correct theory , line , guidelines , and policies , but also on a rural grassroots cadre contingent of a quality capable of withstanding severe tests , with good ideological and work style , and genuinely bent on pursuing the masses ' interests .  
It is necessary to transform work style , practice the leadership accountability system , ensure that all work measures are in place , and gain new and marked achievements in public order work ; we must succeed in markedly lowering the crime rate , improving the public order precautionary setup , further strengthening the masses ' sense of security , markedly improving the all-round quality of the political-legal contingent , and achieving a big improvement in judicial backup work .  
To carry out the struggle to " strike hard " and put things , it is necessary to build a contingent of political and legal workers into a strong contingent of political and legal workers who are up to standard in politics , highly disciplined , perfect in work styles , proficient in professional work , and firm in administering justice .  
and have a full range of technical means for law-enforcement .  Sixth , we must revise and perfect relevant laws and regulations , build a stronger law-enforcement contingent , and improve the level of law-enforcement .  A task of top priority is to conscientiously tackle the outstanding problem that the law is neither fully observed nor enforced .  
At the same time , comprehensive auditing will be conducted and strengthened in the fields of budgetary management , equipment , capital construction , reform items , and the enforcement of economic and financial discipline .  The internal auditing institutions will be improved and reinforced .  Efforts will be made to build a high-quality contingent of auditors who work honestly , diligently , and efficiently .  
It is necessary , in line with the requirement of maintaining the advanced nature , to vigorously step up the building of our ranks , constantly improve the ideological and political quality , the scientific and cultural level , and the professional skills of party-member cadres , and train and bring up a contingent of high-quality party-member cadres .  
We must build , in accordance with the requirement of " enforcing laws strictly and rendering warmhearted service " that was set by General Secretary Jiang , our contingent of political and legal workers into a strong contingent of political and legal workers who are up to standard in politics , highly disciplined , perfect in work styles , proficient in professional work , and firm in administering justice .  
She pointed out that the achievements gained in the customs ' scientific and technological work are the results of the exploration and innovation made by the vast number of customs ' scientific and technological personnel as well as their selfless dedication .  The advanced customs scientific and technological collectives and individuals who were commended today are the outstanding representatives of the contingent of scientists and technicians .  They are the invaluable human resources of the customs sector and deserve the commendation and handsome rewards .  
As an official of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation noted , the motherland is rich in resources and has a vast market that is full of potential .  It also has an abundant supply of labor , low wages , cheap land , a huge contingent of scientific and technological personnel , and an industrial productive system that is complete in range and large in scale .  
Doing a good job in selecting and promoting female cadres and recruiting more female party members is a need in our efforts to fulfill the new tasks under the new situation , to meet the " three represents " requirement , and to build a strong high-quality cadre contingent and to reinforce the party rank and file , and is also an important component part of our work in developing socialist democratic politics and promoting social progress .  
Under a huge banner with a slogan , " Emulate Wang Wei 's spirit and toughen the strong amphibious contingent , " officers and men of the " hard bone sixth company " carried out the most practical and lively education in fostering lofty ideals and conviction .  
The important thinking of " three represents " has provided scientific theoretical guidance to building a contingent of army cadres , so we must put into effect this important thinking in a comprehensive way in the training and selection of cadres to guarantee that the barrels of guns are always held in the hands of the reliable persons loyal to the party .  
Therefore , to ensure that our contingent of army cadres is on the mark politically is the top priority for upholding the principle of the party 's absolute leadership over the army , which has a direct bearing on the prosperity or decline and success or failure of the party 's cause , the prolonged peace and stability of the country , and the overall requirement that the army is " capable of winning the battle " and " will not become morally degenerate . "  
It is especially necessary to take effective policy measures to build and develop a contingent of high-level personnel and versatile personnel who can meet the needs of the new period , with the focus on training and absorbing capable personnel for making innovations , management and operation and on further creating a favorable environment for capable personnel who have returned from studying abroad to do pioneering work .  
Third , the reserve cadre contingent was strengthened to a new degree .  According to the working guideline of " replenishing leading bodies and strengthening reserve force , " through the procedures of democratic recommendation and strict evaluation by the party organizations , outstanding young cadres were added to the reserve cadre contingents at various levels .  These promising young cadres have good political quality and strong work ability , and they are now selected as candidates for leading positions at a higher level .  
It is necessary to continue the activities of creating judicial organs that satisfy the people and being judicial officers who satisfy the people so that the judicial administrative contingent at the grass-roots level will be built into a strong force that is politically up to standard , keeps a strict sense of discipline , maintains a good work style , become more proficient professionally , and enforces laws rigorously .  
Thanks to all these efforts , batches after batches of high-end cadres with high educational backgrounds have been recruited into the military , and have gradually become a main force in the contingent of cadres of our army .  However , there still exists a wide gap between our army and foreign armies in the cultivation of high-quality talent .  For example , officers holding master 's degree and above make up a relatively low proportion in our army ;  
most cadres are deficient in combined capabilities and have a relatively poor scientific and technological quality ; and in particular , there is a shortage of top-notch technological personnel .  It is just as Chairman Jiang has pointed out : " At present , the quality of the cadres contingent of our army has yet to totally suit the demands of our military strategic requirements for the new period , and this is an issue that has to be settled urgently . "  
We must conduct a law-enforcement inspection drive while carrying out the struggle to strike hard and put things in order , make a special endeavor to resolve the pronounced problems facing the contingent of political and legal workers , resolutely purge the tiny number who have brought disgrace to the contingent , and vigorously commend and foster advanced models .  
This professional contingent of helpers and educators are required to hold themselves responsible for the party and the people , enjoy a profound understanding of policy as well as a fairly high theoretical level , have an intimate knowledge of the harms of the evil cult , understand the mentality of " Falungong " practitioners , and are good at doing a patient and painstaking ideological and political work .  
Referring to the situation where cadres still lack a democratic and legal system , the 13th Party Congress consequently proposed to regard the establishment of a state public functionary system as the focus for reforming the personnel system of cadres to conduct scientific management of the contingent of cadres according to law ; thus transforming the previous outdated unitary management pattern and allowing the establishment of a new-type personnel system of cadres based on the principles of attaching importance to solid performance , encouraging competition , and exercising democratic and separated supervisions .  
To carry out Chairman Jiang 's important directive on striving to construct a contingent of high-quality cadres , the General Department of Staff and the General Political Department decided to , starting this year , replace the old system of directly promoting excellent soldiers to the officer level with a new system in which particularly excellent soldiers are selected to be sent to military academies or universities .  These soldiers can be promoted if they pass an examination at the end of the training program at academies or universities .  
Recently , " Nanfang Zhoumo " , a weekend magazine in Guangzhou , was " purged " on a large scale because its reportage deviated from the standards laid down by the central authorities .

The leading body of the editorial office was changed ; several editors and reporters were dismissed or disciplined ; other editors and reporters had to be reexamined and reassessed .  
Without such a guide , the revolutionary contingent would still be disunited and weak , could hardly realize its objectives as planned , and may even lose their way and digress towards the wrong direction , despite the enormous potentiality to change the current situation and the relatively mature revolutionary situation .  
It is necessary to deeply study and implement Comrade Jiang Zemin 's important thinking on " three represents " , conduct more intensive education on the correct world and life outlook and correct values among law enforcement and police officers and judicial personnel , and make greater effort to build a high-quality law enforcement contingent with firm political stand , profession proficiency , good work style , and noble moral standards of being honest and uncorrupt
