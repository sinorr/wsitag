China is a big country having a cultural origin for 5,000 years .  Under the conditions that the market economic structure was established not long ago , the cultural industry has not taken shape , and the cultural market mechanism has not been perfected , the challenges from opening up China 's cultural markets to the outside world are self-evident , and the opportunities objectively exist too .  The crux of the issue is how the government and enterprises will meet with the challenges and seize hold of the rare historical opportunities .  
To meet the need of the continuous development of reform , opening up and modernization drive , the NPC Standing Committee timely made revisions on related laws , such as the Income Tax Law , the Highway Law , the Criminal Law and the Company Law . As a result , those laws have become more suitable to objective reality and can play more active roles in regulating social and economic activities .

Efforts need to be intensified to reform the system of selecting and promoting grassroots cadres in rural areas and to make correct selection and to select well cadres who meet the basic conditions of possessing good political qualifications , of being able to honestly perform official duties , of having good management capabilities , and of enjoying support from party members and from the masses .  
The purpose of formulating a relatively complete civil code on the basis of the existing single-item laws being relatively perfect is to better meet the needs for the development of a socialist market economy and further protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and legal persons .  
The most crucial issue in socialist modern commercial construction is to proceed from the ideology of serving the people whole-heartedly , use modern means to meet consumer demand to the greatest extent , sell genuine goods at reasonable prices , and practice fair transactions , thereby giving enterprises the greatest economic returns .  
And it is being unfolded at a time when various contradictions in reforms and construction are interwoven ; a structure , mechanism , legal system , and management system that meet the demands of the development of socialist market economy await gradual establishment and perfection ; and numerous negative corruption phenomena are prone to occur .  
Only when we continuously develop socialist culture and improve socialist spiritual civilization continuously can we provide a powerful spiritual dynamic force and intellectual support to economic development and overall social progress and can we continuously meet the increasingly growing spiritual and cultural needs of the people .  
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the second-generation collective leadership with Deng Xiaoping as the core carried forward and developed the thought of Mao Zedong on cultural building .  In order to meet the new needs of reform and opening up and socialist modernization building , they put forth and constantly developed our party 's thinking about the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
The reason for China needing a communist party and the reason for the communist party succeeding in mounting China 's social and political stage and displaying great historical roles is exactly because that the communist party can meet the needs of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture , and fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people in China .  
To accelerate the achievement of national modernization , to strengthen comprehensive national capability and international competitiveness , and to meet the opportunities and challenges presented by the new century , it is imperative to earnestly implement the CPC 's education policy , to vigorously develop education , to comprehensively advance personal quality education , and to promote the comprehensive development of children and youths , in an effort to train high quality workers and specialized personnel of various levels and fields meeting the requirements of modernization construction .

In the new historical period , our party must always meet the requirements in the development of the advanced social productive forces in China , adhere to the advancing orientation of China 's progressive culture , and faithfully represent the fundamental interests of the broadest majority of the Chinese people , and a basic and decisive condition for this is that the party must persistently arm the minds of the entire membership and rally the people with the correct ideal and belief .  
All provinces and autonomous regions in the western region must conform their ideology and actions to the policy decisions and work arrangements of the central authorities .  Not only should they fully understand and firmly grasp this rare historical opportunity , enhance their sense of urgency and mission , meet difficulties head-on , and forge ahead with vigorous efforts ; but they should also see clearly that the development gap in the western region is a result of historical reasons formed over a long period of time ;

Judging from the present situation , our social welfare services are inadequate to meet the growing demands of the broad masses .  The imperative task at present is to mobilize and rely on the public to expedite the socialization of social welfare .  This is a task of great importance in building and improving our social security system as well as in promoting social stability and progress .  
Third , to verify the situation of personnel structure and personnel change of the central budget units , and understand in detail the manning quota of the budget units , the actual number and structure of the staff , and the situation of actual average expenditure per person for every outlay in order to provide basic numbers for determining the standard of a fixed number of staff and fixed quotas which meet the real situation .  
Jiang Zemin indicated : Both China and Vietnam are socialist countries under the leadership of the communist party .  In the face of the present complicated and changeable international situation , we two countries should seize the current favorable opportunity , meet the challenges head-on , step up cooperation , and strive for common development .  
It is necessary to continue to learn from and spread the management experience of advanced enterprises , such as Hangang and Yaxing ; gradually introduce and consummate management systems and management standards that meet the requirements of market economy at such stages as production , procurement , and sales of an enterprise and in such areas as quality , costs , finance , and capital ; and develop a scientific and democratic decisionmaking system .  
He pointed out : To promote socialization of social welfare is an inevitable requirement of the socialist market economy system ; a measure to meet the challenge of aging of the population , to meet the urgent need of speeding up the establishment and improvement of a senior citizens ' welfare service system , and to meet the objective demand of the progress of modernization and particularly urbanization ; and an effective way to rapidly alleviate the current contradictions between supply and demand in social welfare .

Some people , violating party and state policy , insert their relatives and friends into the party and government organs , where they can all eat the " fiscal meal " ; thus the great majority of local fiscal funds are wasted on personnel , with the result that they are unable to make ends meet and their finances are all used up in idleness and eating , and this leads to unhealthy trends which persist despite repeated prohibition , thus increasing the masses ' burden and causing dissatisfaction among them .  
However , the United States ignored facts and again put forward an anti-China motion at the meeting of the UN Commission for Human Rights to meet the needs of its domestic political and party struggle , in a vain attempt to make use of the so-called human rights issue to interfere in China 's internal affairs and vilify China 's international image .  
Comrade Mao Zedong said during the rectification campaign in Yanan : Only when we master Marxism can our contingent be consolidated , can our cadres be enhanced in quality , and can we have the ability to meet and to have control over a future bright world .

In particular , the construction of command automation has been implemented for a long time in a random and isolated manner without effective mutual access and mutual exchange between different forces , which has seriously impeded the whole system from giving full play to its mass effectiveness and powerfulness and which can not meet the requirements for battle under high-tech conditions . 
We should recommend the non-party cadres who possess both ability and political integrity and meet the requirements of being more revolutionary , younger in age , better educated , and more professionally competent to hold appropriate leading posts in the government and judicial organs at various levels , give support to their work , let them display their special skill and knowledge , and ensure that they have duties , powers , as well as responsibilities .  
It must be noted that with the end of the economy of shortage , low-standard surpluses are reflected in most fields of merchandise , that our economic structure does not meet the needs of the new macroeconomic situation , and that if the economic structure is not promptly readjusted and optimized , it will be difficult to maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development .  
Adopting advanced scientific means is meant to serve for ideological and political education .  First of all , content of political education must meet the needs of the times .

Xiamen now ranks as one of the top-ten economically strong cities in the country .  To meet the need of the state 's safety , Xiamen has initially built an industrial system , which can rapidly covert civilian production to defense technology industry .  Electronic , machine tool , and chemical industrial enterprises constitute a major part of this industrial system .  
The city has developed , in a selected and planned manner , more than 130 projects that can manufacture products both for military and civilian purposes .  To meet the need of military maneuvers , the city has repeatedly made such a conversion in an effort to turn sci-tech achievements into combat capability .  Now a total of 16 high-tech industrial enterprises are able to manufacture military articles to meet various needs at short notice .  
In the meantime , to meet the need of military combat readiness in the new period , they have integrated wartime and peacetime work , coordinated military and civilian affairs , and worked out an overall plan on building regional battlegrounds in cooperation with the troops stationed in the relevant region , by focusing on port , communication , and ship building .  
To meet with the " limited " strategic missile defense task requirements , the US Defense Department 's Ballistic Missile Defense Bureau has made , in line with the mass production principle , unified arrangements for the research projects of the TMD and NMD systems under the BMD plan .  The ultimate purpose is to enable these defense systems to coordinate with each other in combined operations , to jointly deal with a series of threats , and to provide a " nearly seamless defense network for the United States and for its allies " .

In the face of air threat under the modern high-tech conditions , the most practical issues lying before the air defense forces in making sound preparations for the military struggle are to create a new theory of operation , new contents of training , new methods of training , and a new ground antiaircraft operational command system by centering on " winning " the future war with anti-air raid as its main aspect so as to meet the needs of future anti-air raid operations .

Cadres at the detachment level are required to master the knowledge and the command skills on more than three arms of the services within the scope of the brigade , and to meet the requirement of " being proficient in the professional work on their own posts , getting to know the work on nearby posts , and gaining an intimate knowledge of the work on related posts " ;  
Then we should build corresponding mathematical models and set up information-linkage relations among them .  In this way , it will be easy for us to carry out a systematic analysis on as well as a demonstration and proof of complicated commanding problems .  It is also helpful to form connecting ties between various links so as to meet the requirement of stability in command and control .  
To really practice Marxism , it is imperative to meet the requirements of the " three represents " that Comrade Jiang Zemin put forward recently , that is , our party should always represent the development needs of the China 's advance social productive forces , the onward direction of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the largest number of the Chinese people .  
To meet the requirement for " managing officials strictly " , a large number of good cadres are needed who are firmly loyal to the party 's undertakings , extremely responsible for their work , cherish a bitter hatred for unhealthy trends , are righteous , upright , and outspoken , and have the courage to uphold principles when anything comes up .  
To meet the requirement for " being armed in two aspects " , members of party committees at all levels have continuously intensified their study .  However , in both the range and quality of their study and the conversion and application of the study results , they still fall short of the demand for " winning the war " .  More conspicuous are the inadequate study of military theories and military high-tech knowledge and the lack of versatile personnel .  
In the use of personnel , we should persist in the correct guidance of " using personnel to meet the need in war " , train versatile personnel who know both management and command and who have both rich knowledge and practice experience , have the courage to use outstanding young cadres with better education , moral character , ability , and performance , and improve the structure of leading bodies to raise their overall quality .

During the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea in the early 1950s , Chinese military personnel had to fight against poison gas .  To meet the need of such an extremely severe situation , China 's anti-chemical scientific research institute , which was still being organized and established then , urgently began to develop the most needed poison-detecting equipment .  The curtain was then raised on the development of anti-chemical equipment for our armed forces .  
Both the north and the south have made firm steps toward the relaxation of tension and reconciliation on the peninsula .  Viewed from an historical angle , this is just the beginning of the long road toward peaceful reunification .  With the trend of easing tension and the acceleration in cooperation and exchange , the " agreement on truce " signed during the Cold War period can no longer meet the development and changes of the big trend in the international arena .

All Tthese reform all conform to the objective rules of the military 's economic administration under the socialist market economy , and meet the requirements of the national financial reform .

They should also be introduced if they meet relevant requirements .  In short , capable personnel are the basic conditions for doing any work .

Logistics support must be adapted to such circumstances in order to meet the need of frequent level changes in a joint operation .  This calls for a system in which the organs are streamlined , levels reduced , functions clearly defined , and relationship smooth so as to realize an integral operation from strategic logistics to tactical logistics .  
It is impossible to successfully organize such a colossal and complicated support by relying on the army 's logistic department alone .  The only way to meet the operational needs is to rely on the economic strength of the state as a whole to blend operational logistics support into the " vast logistics " for society to effect an army-civilian integral support .  
The existing joint rear service system based on military regions still adopts the past method of combining supply and demand as one and integrating fund and support-in-kind .  This can hardly meet the demand of the " three-dimensional matrix " style operational mechanism of integrated support .  The mechanism for logistical operation must be changed .

However , with the continuous development of the socialist market economy in our country , the task of ensuring the clear definition of property rights , smooth transactions in property rights , and the safety of such transactions has become increasingly important , and the provisions of the general rules of civil law on real right now do not quite meet the requirements of the developing socialist market economy .

the professional quality and work style of law enforcement do not meet the requirements of the socialist market economy and the principle of governing the country according to law .

In particular , in the complicated and changeable international situation and with the increasingly strained cross-strait relations , the CPC must speed up its modernization on the one hand and make preparations to " meet emergencies " on the other , in order to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity and to ensure that its independent foreign policy is preserved .  
The practice in the construction of our country has also proved that if the productive forces develop slowly , it will be difficult to resolve various kinds of contradictions and problems exiting in economic and social life , and it will also be difficult to meet the people 's demands for improving their living standard .

Our double-support work should meet the demand of the important thinking on the " three represents , " take the development of our social productive forces and the enhancement of our troops ' combat effectiveness as our fundamental starting point and standpoint .

Yu Yongbo said : To carry out the spirit of CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin 's instructions that the military should " fight to win " and " never change its nature " and to meet the requirements on our military officers posed by the new situation and tasks , new requirements that military officers must be " loyal to the CPC , and must have firm revolutionary ideal and conviction and possess modern military knowledge " are added to the basic requirements of military officers stipulated in the current regulations .  
To meet the new situation of reform of the system of cultivating and replenishing military officers and the need of the development of troop modernization building , the draft revision includes particular stipulations on the supply of military officers .

At the threshold of the new century , he continued , it is necessary to enact a National Defense Education Law with Chinese characteristics by summing up our past experience with a view to development in the future .

He also claimed that although the previous rectification drive has closed down many places of entertainment , there are still many fire precaution problems in such places , such as skimping on equipment work or reducing the materials , thus failing to meet the fire precaution standards ; and there are even cases of businesses opening without first being checked and accepted by the fire departments .  The most common problem is the blocking of fire exits , which is extremely dangerous .  
Third , it is necessary to always uphold the central task of economic development , sagaciously grasp the trend of the development of productive forces on a global scale while actively promoting the changes and adjustments of relations of production to meet the needs of the development of productive forces , promote institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation , and seize the opportunity to turn the acceleration of development into the conscious action of the whole party .

Pressured by recent developments , he was forced to lift restrictions on the direct exchange of goods and people between the two islands of Jinmen [ Kinmen ] and Mazu [ Matsu ] and coastal Fujian . However , this is not direct " three links " in the real sense of the word and can not meet the strong desire and pressing demand of the people on both sides of the Strait . It also lags behind the objective situation of growing cross-Strait personnel and economic exchanges .  
Being forced by the development of the situation , the Taiwan authorities could not but make such an " opening . "  This was not direct " three links " in real terms , and could not meet the strong desire and the urgent need of the people on both sides of the strait .  Such an action lagged far behind the objective situation in which personnel exchanges and economic and trade exchanges between the two sides are increasing drastically day by day .  
Thus , the Taiwan side may possibly ask for procuring Kidd-class destroyers before the opening of the annual US-Taiwan arms sales negotiations scheduled to be held in April . If this is really true , newly elected President Bush will meet , for the first time , a grim challenge in handling the subtle military balance between " China " and Taiwan .

But with the severe levels of short sight now prevalent among ROC schoolchildren , it would seem that many fail to meet the basic physical requirements , whatever their degree of aptitude .

Furthermore , " Evergreen 's container fleet is young , and its efficiency grows when modern dock equipment is available . "  
In traditional thinking , the bearing and raising of children is a woman 's natural occupation . Most mothers give their all in caring for their husbands and raising their children .

An official at the Council of Agriculture , the governing body for wildlife protection , notes that " the Wildlife Conservation Law was targeted at the needs of a specific moment . All law is open to change , and in the future we might permit planned hunting , and also trade in game .

Ordinary families in which the husband 's and wife 's combined monthly income is only NT $ 80-90,000 not only need to meet their mortgage payments , cover their childcare fees and pay for three meals a day ; like Kuafu chasing the sun they should also be assiduously pursuing one financial goal after another , each higher than the last .

Chung Shi-kai , a professor in the psychology department at National Chengchi University , says that under the current medical system , professionals of every stripe , including doctors of every specialty and nurses , all have legal requirements to meet and tests to pass .

The year before last the show " Splendors of Imperial China " was well received by the American academic and cultural communities , and afterwards many nations extended invitations to the National Palace Museum . The French government worked especially hard to meet the Musuem 's needs , even passing a new law designating measures to protect foreign art works on exhibition there .

Moreover , in cities , interpersonal relations are often fluid and remote , and an untraditional woman is not likely to meet as much outside pressure . However , on the margins of the city or in the countryside , because interpersonal relations are so close , the conservativeness of couples , in-laws , neighbors , and colleagues creates a dense net . There will be tremendous resistance to any change in a marital relationship . Women in rural areas need to resolve these issues .  
However , the government 's performance did not meet the expectations of the citizens of Macedonia , and in the third parliamentary elections , held last October and November , a coalition of moderate-right parties organized only half a year ago-led by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Party / Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity-won 62 of the 120 seats in parliament . With this majority they formed a new government , and the current premier , 32-year-old Ljupco Georgievski , has become the symbol of a new generation of reformers .  
For instance , before we broke ties with one nation , it informed us that it was facing economic collapse , that for eight months government workers had received no pay and that there had been three attempted military coups .

However , to date the exchange center has not been able to balance demand with supply . Lin Chih-sen , a division chief at the IDB , comments that many raw materials derived from waste do not have the same level of purity as original feedstocks , and so do not meet manufacturers ' requirements .

Hao Tien-hsia 's words seem a little sad , and there is no banquet of life that does n't come to an end with the guests scattering to the four winds . But what 's important is what lasts : Kao Yang still has his annual dinner , and though these old friends rarely meet , the warm feelings are still there . It 's just that , with the Li-Ku dinner on the fourth day of the year finished , in our modern industrial society , it 's time to go back to work .

" When people think about students at star schools they think in terms of students who get good grades , but being a high academic achiever is not the same thing as being gifted , " says Cheng . At Kaohsiung High , which is the most selective school in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung testing zone , quite a few of the students find the textbooks hard to follow . They are so difficult and obscure because their editors designed them to meet the needs of a small group of truly gifted students .  
In that way a small minority of gifted students could enter schools where the curriculum is specifically tailored to meet their needs . But it is n't necessary to make entrance exams exceedingly abstruse just so it is possible to distinguish these students . " There are theoretical bases behind both district high school systems and selective high school systems , and both have their strong points , " says Yang Jen-hsiao , principal of NTNU Affiliated High .  
Buddhism and Taoism seemed less useful than Confucianism in resolving worldly problems . Confucianism thus entered a period of creative transformation in order to meet external challenges to the state .

For example , prior to the Song dynasty , The Great Learning was not a very influential work in China .  
Consider the fact that it depends on the central government for less than 10% of its revenues , while the average for Taiwan 's local governments as a whole stands at about 50% .

Vocational education now faces the problem of providing people with skills for which there is insufficient market demand . Supply and demand imbalance  
Sun Yung-ching observes that " in industrial education , time is money . " The central reason why technical and vocational students are unable to meet the demands of industry is that the equipment they need to train on is too expensive . Schools are unable to meet the financial burden of constantly upgrading facilities and industry is unwilling to receive students for training in their plants , on the one hand because of the possible impact on output , but also out of genuine concern that students could damage precision machinery .  
Perhaps the most common ceramic product was the teapot . After Taiwan 's economy started growing by leaps and bounds in the 1970s , enjoyment of fine teas became a popular pastime , and one for which the teapot was indispensable .

Consciousness of the existence of pottery as an art , however , has led potters since the 1990s to look beyond the teapot and explore the other creative possibilities open to them .

Ever since its independence , Algeria 's principal aim has been the establishment of the institutions that make up a solid State , a State that endures beyond the realm of events and individuals , a State that has been given the weighty task of laying the groundwork for an economic and social machinery geared towards recovering and fully developing the nation 's wealth so as to meet the needs of its people .  
Indeed , the need for fundamental review in the role of public administration and development has become urgent because countries have to meet the complex developmental challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the role of non-governmental organizations and the private sector , while focusing on the primary objectives of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice and economic growth .

It is difficult to persevere in the face of harsh and unjustified criticism and insufficient financial resources while engaged in the complex task of revitalizing the United Nations to meet the needs of a world in rapid transformation .

That programme , which is supported by the international financial institutions with which we have worked out clear-cut modalities for negotiation and cooperation , will enable us better to meet an economic and social future that will be more promising and that will better favour the integration of the Haitian economy into the world scene .  
For in fact the resources allocated to cooperation for development have fallen , on the pretext that up to now this has achieved nothing for the beneficiary countries , including our countries in Africa , whose priorities , at both national and continental level , have been to relieve absolute , endemic poverty , to eradicate hunger and malnutrition , to overcome disease and illiteracy , and to meet the needs for housing and sanitation .  
Rural development and prosperity-decentralization in the region have been expedited by building up economic and social basic services to catalyse sustainable rural development and by expanding the quality and quantity of basic services to meet the local demands of the country .

In strengthening and modernizing the United Nations , the emphasis has to be on enhancing legitimacy , addressing inequities in decision-making processes and promoting efficiency and effectiveness better to meet the changing , complex needs of Members .

Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;

As far as the energy-deficient developing countries are concerned , to meet this challenge and to arrest their ever-increasing dependence on imported energy , mainly oil , it will be necessary to accelerate exploration and development of indigenous energy resources and to develop greater capacity for producing commercial primary energy : oil , natural gas , coal , hydropower and other new and renewable sources of energy .  
Many developing countries are already burdened by high oil import bills ; therefore any new and additional supply from indigenous energy resources would greatly contribute towards the relief of this burden .  NULLA major problem facing most developing countries now , and one they will be facing increasingly in the future , is that of mobilizing the capital necessary to meet their growing energy requirements , against a background of stagnant multilateral loans and grants and falling official development assistance .

The Secretary-General strongly believes that adoption of this approach would provide the Secretariat with the adequate , assured and predictable annual level of resources necessary to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters , which the current funding methodology and formula has not .  
In the interest of current government efforts to meet the complex development challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the expanding role of the market and private sector and of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice , protecting the environment and supporting participatory democracy , the need for a fundamental review of the role of public administration in development is urgent and apparent now more than ever .

Decides to establish , within the approved overall budget level for the current biennium , a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts , appointed on the basis of equitable geographical representation after consultations with the regional groups , to meet for two periods of five working days prior to the fifty _ fourth session of the Commission , with a mandate to :  
Accordingly , it is proposed that the budget should include both an annual provision for the normal operational costs of the library and provision to meet the start-up costs of the library , that is , funds for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treatises , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate . 
An important activity , necessitated by the urgency with which accurate information is often requested at the United Nations / specialized agencies desk and the lack of comprehensive tools that would readily provide that information , is the creation of basic ready reference tools ( files , lists and the like ) to meet recurrent queries .  
As a result of this initiative by Ethiopia , leaders of 26 Somali political organizations were able to meet for a high-level consultation in Sodere , Ethiopia , and after eight weeks of intensive , frank and responsible negotiations , agreed on a common course of action to resolve the crisis in their country and to put an end to the misery and suffering of their people .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 3 June 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , giving details of the aerial violations that have accompanied the incursions into Iraq 's territory by the Turkish armed forces and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and to halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
The Commission shall meet annually , each session comprising a senior officials ' segment followed by a ministerial segment , for up to a maximum of seven working days to discuss and decide upon important issues concerning economic and social development in the region , to decide upon the recommendations of its subsidiary bodies and of the Executive Secretary , to examine and approve the programme of work and priorities and to take any other decisions required , in conformity with its terms of reference .  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to promote regional economic cooperation by identifying and addressing major development issues and regional concerns and priorities in trade , investment , financial , information technology , industrial and technological areas , and recommend policy options and measures to achieve tangible results and enhance national capacities to meet new challenges .  
The deliberations of the three committees confirmed once again how the parallel developments in cartographic and in information technology were rapidly bringing to users cost-effective applications in surveying , charting and mapping as a comprehensive set of the tools and effective approaches required to meet the challenge of sustainable development and the priorities of the countries in the region .  
The Civil Affairs Unit continues to coordinate with legal non-governmental organizations to resolve cases where the Government of Croatia does not issue documents according to the agreed procedures , including failure to meet administrative deadlines , refusals to issue passports to men of military age and refusals issued without the adequate explanation required by Croatian law .  
Recognizing that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential in achieving sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , and that North-South and South-South transfer of environmentally sound technologies is essential for sustainable development , and recognizing also that the fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their sustainable development requirements has not materialized ,  
Inability on the part of UNOPS to meet administrative costs or to respond to the financial consequences of extraordinary or unanticipated contingencies could result in claimant demands that alternative financing arrangements be placed before the Executive Board , including that responsibility be shared with or assumed by UNDP , the United Nations , or other UNOPS clients .  
This action has received increased support from different donor sources ; however , additional and increased development assistance is to be directed towards the basic social services with a view to improving primary and reproductive health care , basic education , skills development and literacy in priority , to at least meet the targets set by recent international conferences . 
The Joint Border Commission continues to meet on a regular basis and to focus on resolving the disputed border areas it had previously identified , but the results of its work have thus far fallen short of the expectations and the public statements of intent of the two parties in this regard .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 21 August 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , calling attention to the fact that Turkish military operations in northern Iraq are continuing to violate Iraq 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
In approving the new distribution plan , I have informed the Government that the United Nations accepts the Government 's assurances as a commitment that the necessary additional resources will be available for vulnerable groups in central and southern Iraq . I have also informed the Government that the United Nations will continue to observe the situation of such groups in the context of my responsibilities under resolutions 986 ( 1995 ) and 1111 ( 1997 ) to determine and report on the adequacy of resources to meet the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi population .  
In this connection , the Secretary-General wishes to draw the attention of the General Committee to a letter dated 11 September 1997 ( A / 52 / 340 ) in which the Chairman of the Committee on Conferences informed the President of the General Assembly that the Committee had recommended , on the strict understanding that meetings would have to be accommodated within available facilities and services , that the following subsidiary organs should be authorized to meet during the main part of the fifty-second session : ( a ) Committee for Programme and Coordination ;  
Following the rapid and massive return of refugees in late 1996 and early 1997 , UNICEF focused on quickly expanding essential services in Rwanda , such as health , nutrition , education and social services , to meet the urgent needs of returning children . 
Also invites States to develop comprehensive strategies at the national , regional and local levels to meet the increase in demand for care and support for older persons as individuals , within their families and communities , and within institutions , bearing in mind the changing socio-economic , technological and cultural environment ;  
I am pleased to announce my own plans to visit the continent before the end of the year , to meet with leaders and people there and to make as real as I can America 's commitment to stand with Africans as they realize long-delayed aspirations for true freedom , growing prosperity and simple human dignity .  
The Commission also decided to retain the special bodies for least developed , landlocked and island developing countries , which would continue to meet biennially for a maximum of two days immediately prior to the annual session of the Commission .  
We again stress the need to increase resources from bilateral and multilateral sources to finance alternative development programmes and projects , including in them the social and economic aspects of drug trafficking , in order to meet the needs of the communities involved in the growing of illicit crops .  
In the 115 municipalities covered by the National Reconstruction Plan which were identified as having been most seriously affected by the conflict , social and production programmes designed to help meet the economic and social needs of poor communities were carried out ; these communities benefited from initiatives for agricultural development , social infrastructure , training and technical assistance , credit , establishment of micro-enterprises , social development and environmental management .  
China is in favour of imposing strict and feasible restrictions on anti-personnel landmines and their use , with a view to achieving the objective of an ultimate ban in a step-by-step manner .  In order to meet its legitimate defence requirements , China can not but reserve its legitimate right to use anti-personnel landmines on its own territories before alternative means are found and defensive capabilities established .  
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-servicing obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
It can be achieved only through a multidimensional and integrated approach that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities and public services , enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
The Global Environment Facility , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the Facility instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
To meet this objective , this Advisory Committee of the Secretary-General has encouraged all countries to ensure ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems as part of their national development plans by the year 2000 .  
The Union 's institutional capacity , as indicated by the evaluation report , needs to be further enhanced , particularly for reaching ethnic minorities , through ( a ) the adaptation of communication materials to meet their needs ; ( b ) a decentralized process for developing materials ; and ( c ) upgrading members ' skills in interactive and participatory communication .  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
The European Union expressed the hope that in 1997 sufficient contributions would be announced to meet all the needs provided for in the budget for 1998 , and urged all other States , especially the rich States of the region , to increase the size of their contributions in the light of the Agencys growing needs .  
According to reliable sources available to the Commission , the exiled Rwandan political and military elite located in Nairobi have formed an " invasion group " to plan for the invasion of Rwanda in pincer-movement attacks from the east and the west - the camps in Zaire and United Republic of Tanzania - which would " meet in Kigali " to conquer the country and restore Hutu rule .  
In its deliberations , the Commission noted the interest that various forms of private participation in public infrastructure projects had raised in many States , in particular in developing countries , as the successful implementation of such projects would enable States to achieve significant savings in public expenditure and to reallocate the resources that otherwise would have been invested in infrastructure in order to meet more pressing social needs .  
Modalities for cooperation between the public and private sectors are being developed and the construction industry is reorganizing itself to meet the changing demands of large and complex redevelopment projects , involving mixed uses and integrated infrastructure and finance mechanisms . 
Ultimately , an Organization reformed along these lines and better able to meet global challenges will have to strengthen its ties with and complement regional organizations , not only in the political field but also at the social and economic level .  
There is absolutely no doubt that increased international assistance and initiatives for debt relief or cancellation , increased official development assistance to meet agreed targets , private capital flows , increased foreign direct investment , and improved terms of trade would play a catalytic role in Africa 's efforts to achieve economic development .  
When we speak of reform in the United Nations , we have in mind first and foremost an effective distribution of United Nations resources , the streamlining of the Organization 's administrative and organizational structures , and budgetary and structural reform of the United Nations Secretariat , as well as personnel adjustments to meet the challenges of the modern world .  
The United Nations , as a special and irreplaceable place for 185 States to meet , work together and cooperate , must lay down rules of law recognized universally by all so that international relations can continue in a coherent , equitable and efficient manner .  
We feel that the United Nations system should be made stronger , more effective and more efficient in order to meet the priorities set by all its Members not just the priorities of the economically strong and the militarily powerful but , especially , the priorities of the weak and vulnerable States , which should be prevented from becoming outsiders in the global economy .  
This will enable the Organization to meet the daunting challenges of economic development faced by our global community and those posed by the political and ideological differences afflicting nations today .  
We are seeking to build a modern society capable of accompanying the world on its march forward and of assimilating scientific and technological information ; a society aware of the challenges of our time and working to meet those challenges .  
It is the aim of the Jamaican Government to develop adequate employment opportunities , matched by improvements in the skills and literacy of our human resources , recognizing that an effectively trained , adaptable and flexible work force is critical if we are to meet the demands of the economy .  
In conclusion , my delegation pledges its support to you , Mr . President , including in your capacity as Chairman of the Open-ended Working Group , to take our work forward in a practical and constructive manner towards an outcome which will result in an expanded , more representative , more transparent Security Council , better equipped to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century .  
For most developing countries , continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet the needs for investment capital , foreign exchange , and human development priorities .  
When resources of the central government are insufficient to meet the needs for public services and infrastructure , local authorities and non-governmental organizations can play an important role in raising resources , providing services , strengthening rural / urban linkages , stimulating private investment , and implementing national policies .  
Continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet those needs , to support structural adjustment , and to enable the least developed countries and other low-income countries to benefit from globalization and to generate sustained growth .  
Developed countries , in the mutual interests of donors and recipients , must sustain existing levels of bilateral and multilateral ODA and other official finance to developing countries and improve their quality in order to better meet the growing demand for modern economic infrastructure , health and education , environmental protection and policy reforms .  
For such standards to be effective , they will need to meet three basic standards of their own : they must be " floors " , rather than " ceilings " - that is , they must block downward but not upward movement ; they must be set high enough to make a real impact , rather than at a least-common-denominator level ; and they must be developed through an open and inclusive process that will build a strong consensus for them .  
In this regard , the Habitat Agenda contains numerous suggestions for action , such as ensuring legal protection from discrimination in access to shelter and basic services ; helping the family in its supporting , educating and nurturing roles ; and encouraging social and economic policies that are designed to meet the housing needs of families and their individual members .  
The main obstacles are the lack of effective legislation for the monitoring and control of pollution and the absence of effective cost-recovery systems at the local or national level to meet the costs of treatment , protection of water sources , cleaning up polluted water and other essential measures .  
The challenge today remains the same : to meet an enormous projected global demand for resources , especially energy , through the use of new products , technologies and consumption patterns which will provide rising standards of living for all while minimizing economic costs and risks to human health and the environment .  
There is a growing need to integrate urban needs with those of the surrounding rural , or once rural areas ; to assess changes in the peri-urban areas in response to rapid urbanization ; to prepare strategies to meet the concentrated demands for food , energy and various material goods ; to ensure that urban development proceeds in an environmentally sound manner ; and to involve all stakeholders in urban development projects .  
Decides that the preparatory process for the special session of the General Assembly should be funded through the regular budget of the United Nations , bearing in mind the need to keep financial costs to a minimum , and that Governments should be invited to make extrabudgetary contributions to meet those costs ;  
Also in its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission reaffirmed the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States by undertaking advisory services and training programmes ; by carrying out field studies at the regional , subregional , national and local levels , also drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions ; by developing comprehensive strategic plans for technical cooperation ; and by preparing model assistance projects .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 51 / 63 , reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and stressed the need to continue to improve the operational activities of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States , at their request , for support in crime prevention and criminal justice .  
It is expected that about two thirds of the increases in agricultural production required to meet projected increases in effective demand will come as a result of improved yields from land currently under cultivation in developing countries , much of which is irrigated .  
The continued existence of the problem of internal displacement combined with the ongoing need to search for solutions require that the capacity of the Representatives mandate and of the United Nations human rights machinery in general be strengthened in order to meet these challenges in a comprehensive and effective manner .  
In addition to being flexible , any new system of desirable ranges should meet a number of operational requirements ; such a system , inter alia , should produce predictable and verifiable results , be easy to administer and be transparent .  
The overall humanitarian situation in Tajikistan has remained critical .  A dramatic deterioration of the social and industrial infrastructure and a decline in the provision of social , health and education services , the lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes , and a sharp drop in the real income of most families have combined to render large sectors of the population in Tajikistan unable to meet even their basic food needs .  
The safety of space NPS at all stages of their operation and in the event of foreseeable accidents will be ensured by safety systems and NPS structural elements designed to meet safety requirements , and by special comprehensive administrative and technical measures to prevent accidents and eliminate the effects of accidents .  
It has been increasingly recognized that positive measures are important and can be indispensable elements to assist developing countries to meet the multilaterally agreed targets of an MEA , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility .  
As far as global problems are concerned , there is a considerable potential for generating win-win scenarios if foreign investors also transfer best environmental practices and technologies in order to enable developing countries to meet their commitments under MEAs . 
According to the Secretary-General 's interim report , this will be achieved in two ways : in the 15 governorates of central and southern Iraq , the Government will distribute the goods according to its current food rationing system , but will be observed to ensure the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies and . . . the adequacy of revenues to meet Iraq 's humanitarian needs ( para . 26 ) ; while in the three northern governorates distribution will be by the United Nations according to current modalities and existing resources ( para .  20 ) .  
To meet the rapidly evolving tasks of the Programme , a new approach to its financing is required which , in the view of the High Commissioner , must be based on increased funds from the regular budget , expanded partnerships with United Nations agencies and programmes , including UNDP and the World Bank , NGOs and academic institutions , and on a greater contribution by Governments interested in receiving technical assistance .  
That delegation also expressed the view that the safety of those spacecraft at all stages of their operation and in the event of foreseeable accidents would be ensured by safety systems and nuclear power source structural elements designed to meet safety requirements and by special comprehensive administrative and technical measures to prevent accidents and eliminate the effects of accidents .  
With regard to project activities , the Committee was informed that a reserve is maintained for each project in accordance with United Nations administrative instructions ( ST / AI / 285 ) for technical cooperation trust funds , which stipulates in Part IV , B , that " a cash reserve at the level of 15 per cent of the annual estimated expenditures " is to be maintained during the implementation of the trust fund activities to cover eventual shortfalls and will be utilized to meet the final expenditure of the trust fund , including liquidating liabilities .  
Also invites States to develop comprehensive strategies at the national , regional and local level to meet the increase in demand for care and support for older persons as individuals , within their families and communities , as well as in institutions , bearing in mind the changing socio-economic , technological and cultural environment ;  
Sharp reductions in the level of assistance for social welfare , health care and education ; insufficient energy supplies for hospitals , schools and residences ; and reduced real income for most families have hindered the ability of Tajikistan 's population to meet its most basic human needs .  
Although increased private flows have led to investments in industry and technology in some developing countries and economies in transition , many other developing countries have been left behind , slowing the process of technological change in those countries and limiting their ability to meet their commitments under Agenda 21 and other international agreements .  
Donor Governments should strive to meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance as soon as possible ; and interested developed and developing country partners , having agreed on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes , should take into account a gender perspective .  
Notes with appreciation the strengthened training programmes , inter alia , people management training , upgrading of substantive skills , information technology , communications and training in all six official languages on an equal basis , and requests the Secretary-General to continue to invest in the Organization 's future capacity by sustaining and expanding these programmes in order to meet organizational needs and individual career development aspirations ;  
Decides to establish a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts , appointed on the basis of equitable geographical representation after consultations with the regional groups , to meet for a period of 10 working days prior to the fifty _ fourth session of the Commission , with a mandate to : 
Notes with appreciation the strengthened training programmes , inter alia , people management training , upgrading of substantive skills , information technology , communications and training in all six official languages on an equal basis , and requests the Secretary-General to continue to invest in the Organization 's future capacity by sustaining and expanding these programmes in order to meet organizational needs and individual career development aspirations ;  
While the Committee appreciates the need to upgrade the system , especially in the aftermath of the damage to existing facilities resulting from a fire at UNFICYP headquarters , the Committee believes that the system should be at a level sufficient to meet the operational needs of the mission and that the introduction of " stand-alone " or highly specialized , sophisticated and expensive equipment , entailing additional training and staff resources , as indicated in paragraph 11 of the same annex , should be avoided or kept to a minimum . 
Canada noted that the outline was very comprehensive , but that a manual that concentrated on basic issues would be better suited to meet the needs of both developed and developing countries .  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Therefore , the members of such groups should either be covered by the conditions applicable to popular armed resistance groups , thereby subjecting them to the provisions and obligations of international humanitarian law to a certain extent , or should be regarded as groups that fail to meet the international requirements for classification as legal combatants , either as members of a regular army or a legitimate resistance movement , in which case , being totally beyond the pale of the law , there would be no point in placing them under any obligation . 
The indicators meet certain essential criteria : they are considered to be ethical , useful , scientifically robust , representative , understandable and accessible .  
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) has implemented HIV / AIDS prevention projects in sub-Saharan Africa , to meet the combined objectives of industrial development and the prevention of the spread of HIV / AIDS . UNIDO is supporting improved access to and affordability of products used in prevention programmes condoms , latex gloves , syringes , HIV-1 / 2 test kits through development of local manufacturing capability . 
The technological advances that were often readily available to potential terrorists called for a higher degree of political cooperation , and new challenges would undoubtedly emerge that would require innovative legal approaches and techniques to meet them , and joint efforts with other international and regional bodies . 
His Government ( a democratically elected one , as the international and regional organizations that had supervised the electoral process had duly reported ) had enacted just such domestic legislation , and had met , and would continue to meet , its corresponding international obligations .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
A number of delegations expressed their concerns in regard to the serious financial situation of the Centre , with many noting that the financial resources available to the Centre were inadequate and that the Centre required enhanced financial as well as human resources if it were to meet its challenges at the global , regional , national and local levels .  
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
Other objectives include the provision of timely and authoritative information by the Spokesman for the Secretary-General to media representatives , the provision of timely and adaptable information materials through the United Nations information centres to meet regional and local needs , the establishment of an international broadcasting system and monitoring of international trends and events as reflected in the media , as well as coverage of the Organization and the Secretary-General by major media networks .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 26 May 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , giving details of the aerial violations that have accompanied the fresh incursions into Iraq 's territory by the Turkish armed forces and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and to halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
In the mid-1990s , private flows have been exceeding official sources : ODA has shrunk to an all time low of 0.27 per cent of GNP , and a growing portion is going to meet humanitarian needs ( rising from US $ 1-billion in 1990 to US $ 3-billion in 1993 , peaking in 1994 ) and debt relief .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 31 May 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , giving details of the aerial violations that have accompanied the fresh incursions into Iraq 's territory by the Turkish armed forces and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and to halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
It can only be achieved through a multidimensional and integrated approach , that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities , public services , and enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 12 June 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , giving details of the aerial violations that have accompanied the continuing incursion into Iraq 's territory by the Turkish armed forces and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and to halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
Although the distributional impact of harmonized national carbon taxes may be uneven , it could be complemented by allocating the revenue to a trust fund to be used to finance projects for those countries which are overburdened with carbon taxes . 29 The rates should be chosen to meet the carbon emission abatement objective and should be periodically adjusted as more is learned about global warming .  
Referring to Recommendation No .  3 of the Committee 's eighth session , in which the Committee invited the Director-General to examine the possibility of establishing an international fund intended to facilitate the restitution of stolen or illicitly exported cultural objects in cases where the countries concerned are unable to meet the related financial costs ,  
The inventory of financial needs and the data base of financial sources would have the following characteristics in order to ensure their effective use : ( i ) available to participants in the CCD consultative processes ; ( ii ) disseminated through various channels , including the Internet ; ( iii ) packaged to meet the needs of customers ; and ( iv ) frequently updated .  27 .  Inventory of financial requirements .  
Unfortunately and I repeat , unfortunately the persistent reluctance of the countries of the North to respect their commitments to the developing countries by granting additional financial resources , increasing public development aid to 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and transferring eco-technologies under favourable conditions , is considerably restricting the capacity of these countries to meet the requirements of sustainable development . 
The Fund has maintained a solid financial standing and has been utilized by operational organizations of the United Nations system on 48 occasions to meet urgent relief requirements .  
In resolution 1997 / 15 , the Commission decided to establish a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts to meet prior to the fifty-fourth session of the Commission with a mandate to : ( a ) gather all relevant information from Governments , non-governmental organizations and any other relevant sources on the obstacles existing to the effective and full protection of the human rights of migrants ; and ( b ) elaborate recommendations to strengthen the promotion , protection and implementation of the human rights of migrants .  
Recognizing also that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , and fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements ,  
Strongly urge the industrialized countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources to meet their commitments under and the requirements of Agenda 21 and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent gross national product ( GNP ) as official development assistance immediately , and also to ensure that within that target 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of GNP is earmarked for least developed countries ;  
As established in Agenda 21 , the global partnership for sustainable development must be based on the transfer of new and additional resources to developing countries to meet their immense needs and enable them to achieve sustainable development .  
Furthermore , irrational phenomena still existed in the world economic system which were hampering the development efforts of developing countries , including the stagnation of international cooperation in such areas as finance , debt , trade and the transfer of technology ; the protectionism still practised by some of the major developed countries in international trade and economic activities ; and the emphasis placed by those countries on the role of private capital and market mechanisms , while minimizing the responsibility of their Governments to meet their commitments with regard to official development assistance .  
The assembled leaders renewed their commitment to ensure that all people , at all times , have physical and economic access to sufficient , safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life .  
A network of educational facilities providing education and training in space science and technology at the postgraduate level should be developed to meet the increasing need in the region for adequately educated and trained human resources .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Although humanitarian agencies have continued to transport modest quantities of medical and other non-food supplies across the Guinean border , those operations have been insufficient to meet the growing needs of a collapsing primary health care system .  
Pursuant to various legislative mandates , the United Nations Programme in Public Administration and Finance has sought to meet the expressed needs of developing countries in improving their administrative and financial management systems for development .  
To them the end of the cold war simply dictated changes in the positioning of strategic and tactical nuclear weapons and the taking of steps to develop new nuclear-weapon systems to meet the geopolitical requirements of the new international system .  
The expansion of demand from the public sector is hindered by budgetary constraints : insufficient public funds are available to meet the needs for environmental infrastructure building / upgrading and clean _ up in developed and developing countries .  
The growing space industry and the many associated service and scientific organizations require a steady flow of enthusiastic , trained and competent young engineers and scientists to meet the challenges of the future .  
In today \ x { e5b8 } global marketplace , where the supply is produced in one location to meet a demand elsewhere and in which profits from such illegal transactions can be hidden in numerous jurisdictions , enhanced international cooperation is key .  
The Committee decided that in the future it would meet in private half an hour before starting consideration of a country report , in order to pinpoint the main problems to be addressed during public discussion .  
Noting the importance of adherence to internationally accepted norms and principles as well as the need to promote , as required , national and international legislation to meet actual and potential humanitarian challenges ,  
A critical element is the availability of public resources to finance and support publicly provided services and to stimulate and complement private and voluntary provision , as appropriate , and their more effective and efficient use to meet stated objectives .  
The Government 's social security policy is to meet the basic and special needs of the disadvantaged , including the financially vulnerable , the elderly and the severely disabled .  
Noting the importance of adherence to internationally accepted norms and principles and the need to promote , as required , national and international legislation to meet actual and potential humanitarian challenges ,  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
In conclusion , he said that he wished to reiterate that UNEP needed a solid financial base in order to discharge its strengthened mandate and meet the growing environmental challenges worldwide .

At the special session of the General Assembly in 1997 to review the implementation of Agenda 21 , it was acknowledged that considerable progress had been made at the national level but that , at the same time , there was an urgent need to address the lack of fulfilment of the international commitments voluntarily entered into by developed countries either to assist developing countries or to meet their own obligations on account of their historical industrialization as well as their current unsustainable patterns of production and consumption .  
To establish the increasingly necessary restrictions on the activities of certain non-State sectors currently acting as they please within the international framework , with a view to making them meet the national and international standards ensuring the protection of the basic rights , including human rights , of the most vulnerable sectors , in particular local workers , indigenous peoples , national or ethnic minorities and migrant workers ;

The launching of the 650-million " H shares " of Shenzhen Expressway Stock Company , Ltd , right afterward was recently a great success , with raised capital surpassing 400-million HK dollars .  
The circular states : Personnel departments at all levels should provide preferential policies to meet the personnel needs of state-owned large and medium-sized key enterprises that conform to the state industrial policy , the units that undertake the state 's key construction and scientific research projects for the Ninth Five-Year Plan period , the agriculture , water conservancy , energy , transportation , and telecommunications units that the state strengthens on a priority basis , the units of the pillar industries , and the national defense and military units .  
China is a big country having a cultural origin for 5,000 years .  Under the conditions that the market economic structure was established not long ago , the cultural industry has not taken shape , and the cultural market mechanism has not been perfected , the challenges from opening up China 's cultural markets to the outside world are self-evident , and the opportunities objectively exist too .  The crux of the issue is how the government and enterprises will meet with the challenges and seize hold of the rare historical opportunities .  
To meet the need of the continuous development of reform , opening up and modernization drive , the NPC Standing Committee timely made revisions on related laws , such as the Income Tax Law , the Highway Law , the Criminal Law and the Company Law . As a result , those laws have become more suitable to objective reality and can play more active roles in regulating social and economic activities .  
main measures to be taken should meet the requirements of strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control , optimizing the economic structure , properly scheduling key state projects , truly improving the people 's livelihood , actively increasing employment , ensuring social insurance work , and ensuring sustainable development .  
and the major measures should meet the requirements for strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control , optimizing the economic structure , planning state key construction projects well , effectively improving people 's living standards , actively promoting employment , and succeeding in social security work and sustainable development .  
He said : In future , we will further arm the entire party with Deng Xiaoping Theory so that our party will always meet the requirements for the development of the advanced social productive forces , march in the direction toward an advanced culture , be the loyal representative of the fundamental interests of the greatest majority of the Chinese people , lead the entire country and people to cope with various difficulties and challenges , and victoriously stride into the 21st century .  
We should increase our support of expenditures in the public welfare area to ensure that science and technology , education , social security , agriculture , ecological conservation , and other key areas and fields have the necessary funds to meet their expenditure needs .  We should increase our financial support for the establishment of a disaster prevention system , for projects designed to protect natural forests and to return grain plots to forestry , for poverty relief work , and for raising the peasants ' income .  
Departments of spiritual promotion and cultural education must organize and guide a large batch of artistic workers and scientific promotion workers to go deep into the frontline of the socialist reform and modernization construction .  They should absorb nourishment and find materials there , create high-quality spiritual products and meet people 's demand for improving their quality of spiritual civilization .  
Efforts need to be intensified to reform the system of selecting and promoting grassroots cadres in rural areas and to make correct selection and to select well cadres who meet the basic conditions of possessing good political qualifications , of being able to honestly perform official duties , of having good management capabilities , and of enjoying support from party members and from the masses .  
The purpose of formulating a relatively complete civil code on the basis of the existing single-item laws being relatively perfect is to better meet the needs for the development of a socialist market economy and further protect the legitimate rights and interests of citizens and legal persons .  
The most crucial issue in socialist modern commercial construction is to proceed from the ideology of serving the people whole-heartedly , use modern means to meet consumer demand to the greatest extent , sell genuine goods at reasonable prices , and practice fair transactions , thereby giving enterprises the greatest economic returns .  
And it is being unfolded at a time when various contradictions in reforms and construction are interwoven ; a structure , mechanism , legal system , and management system that meet the demands of the development of socialist market economy await gradual establishment and perfection ; and numerous negative corruption phenomena are prone to occur .  
Only when we continuously develop socialist culture and improve socialist spiritual civilization continuously can we provide a powerful spiritual dynamic force and intellectual support to economic development and overall social progress and can we continuously meet the increasingly growing spiritual and cultural needs of the people .  
After the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , the second-generation collective leadership with Deng Xiaoping as the core carried forward and developed the thought of Mao Zedong on cultural building .  In order to meet the new needs of reform and opening up and socialist modernization building , they put forth and constantly developed our party 's thinking about the building of socialist spiritual civilization .  
The reason for China needing a communist party and the reason for the communist party succeeding in mounting China 's social and political stage and displaying great historical roles is exactly because that the communist party can meet the needs of advanced social productive forces , advanced culture , and fundamental interests of the broadest masses of people in China .  
To accelerate the achievement of national modernization , to strengthen comprehensive national capability and international competitiveness , and to meet the opportunities and challenges presented by the new century , it is imperative to earnestly implement the CPC 's education policy , to vigorously develop education , to comprehensively advance personal quality education , and to promote the comprehensive development of children and youths , in an effort to train high quality workers and specialized personnel of various levels and fields meeting the requirements of modernization construction .  
It is necessary , on the basis of centering on personal quality education , to intensify the reform of the school-running system and to encourage social forces to operate schools , so as to meet the need of economic development and comprehensive social progress for diverse personnel and to meet needs of the capital city 's reform , opening , and modernization construction .  
In the new historical period , our party must always meet the requirements in the development of the advanced social productive forces in China , adhere to the advancing orientation of China 's progressive culture , and faithfully represent the fundamental interests of the broadest majority of the Chinese people , and a basic and decisive condition for this is that the party must persistently arm the minds of the entire membership and rally the people with the correct ideal and belief .  
All provinces and autonomous regions in the western region must conform their ideology and actions to the policy decisions and work arrangements of the central authorities .  Not only should they fully understand and firmly grasp this rare historical opportunity , enhance their sense of urgency and mission , meet difficulties head-on , and forge ahead with vigorous efforts ; but they should also see clearly that the development gap in the western region is a result of historical reasons formed over a long period of time ;  
To meet the needs in speeding up the strategic adjustments of the economic structure , expanding domestic demand , promoting economic growth and social development , the party Central Committee and the State Council now took the tourist industry as a new growth point of the national economy , made great efforts to foster and support it , and set forth new requirements for the tourist industry under the new situation .  
The variety of grain supply will be determined by the provincial governments in accordance with the living habits of peasants in the areas where the grain plots are returned to forests and grasslands , the variety of grains originally planted in the areas where the grain plots are returned to forests and grasslands , and the actual situation of grain in stock in the locality in an effort to better meet the basic living need of peasants in these areas .  
Judging from the present situation , our social welfare services are inadequate to meet the growing demands of the broad masses .  The imperative task at present is to mobilize and rely on the public to expedite the socialization of social welfare .  This is a task of great importance in building and improving our social security system as well as in promoting social stability and progress .  
Third , to verify the situation of personnel structure and personnel change of the central budget units , and understand in detail the manning quota of the budget units , the actual number and structure of the staff , and the situation of actual average expenditure per person for every outlay in order to provide basic numbers for determining the standard of a fixed number of staff and fixed quotas which meet the real situation .  
Jiang Zemin indicated : Both China and Vietnam are socialist countries under the leadership of the communist party .  In the face of the present complicated and changeable international situation , we two countries should seize the current favorable opportunity , meet the challenges head-on , step up cooperation , and strive for common development .  
It is necessary to continue to learn from and spread the management experience of advanced enterprises , such as Hangang and Yaxing ; gradually introduce and consummate management systems and management standards that meet the requirements of market economy at such stages as production , procurement , and sales of an enterprise and in such areas as quality , costs , finance , and capital ; and develop a scientific and democratic decisionmaking system .  
He pointed out : To promote socialization of social welfare is an inevitable requirement of the socialist market economy system ; a measure to meet the challenge of aging of the population , to meet the urgent need of speeding up the establishment and improvement of a senior citizens ' welfare service system , and to meet the objective demand of the progress of modernization and particularly urbanization ; and an effective way to rapidly alleviate the current contradictions between supply and demand in social welfare .  
In order to achieve fundamental changes in the economic setup and the method of economic growth , and embark on a path of coordinated economic and social development with higher speed , better economic returns , and continual improvement of overall quality , it is essential to meet the demands of developing socialist market economy , further deepen the fiscal and taxation reforms , and do a good job in fiscal and taxation work .  
Some people , violating party and state policy , insert their relatives and friends into the party and government organs , where they can all eat the " fiscal meal " ; thus the great majority of local fiscal funds are wasted on personnel , with the result that they are unable to make ends meet and their finances are all used up in idleness and eating , and this leads to unhealthy trends which persist despite repeated prohibition , thus increasing the masses ' burden and causing dissatisfaction among them .  
However , the United States ignored facts and again put forward an anti-China motion at the meeting of the UN Commission for Human Rights to meet the needs of its domestic political and party struggle , in a vain attempt to make use of the so-called human rights issue to interfere in China 's internal affairs and vilify China 's international image .  
Comrade Mao Zedong said during the rectification campaign in Yanan : Only when we master Marxism can our contingent be consolidated , can our cadres be enhanced in quality , and can we have the ability to meet and to have control over a future bright world .  
In deciding on a strategic goal , we should try to meet our national security needs and comply with at once the needs of our national economic development and electronic information industry development and the needs of increasingly fierce competition on the domestic and international markets .  
Especially since its Third Plenary Meeting of the 11th National People 's Congress , our Party has re-established its ideological lines and has made significant decisions and taken strategic measures like reforms and opening-up policies to meet the development needs of the times.has greatly emancipated and developed the productive forces , accelerated the construction of the socialist material civilization and of the socialist spiritual civilization and has paved a way toward building up socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
In particular , the construction of command automation has been implemented for a long time in a random and isolated manner without effective mutual access and mutual exchange between different forces , which has seriously impeded the whole system from giving full play to its mass effectiveness and powerfulness and which can not meet the requirements for battle under high-tech conditions . 
We should recommend the non-party cadres who possess both ability and political integrity and meet the requirements of being more revolutionary , younger in age , better educated , and more professionally competent to hold appropriate leading posts in the government and judicial organs at various levels , give support to their work , let them display their special skill and knowledge , and ensure that they have duties , powers , as well as responsibilities .  
It must be noted that with the end of the economy of shortage , low-standard surpluses are reflected in most fields of merchandise , that our economic structure does not meet the needs of the new macroeconomic situation , and that if the economic structure is not promptly readjusted and optimized , it will be difficult to maintain sustained , rapid , and healthy economic development .  
Adopting advanced scientific means is meant to serve for ideological and political education .  First of all , content of political education must meet the needs of the times .  Political education content should be colorful and knowledge-based or it will not only not be conducive to solving ideological problems but also will produce negative impacts and cancel out the results of ideological and political education .  
Xiamen now ranks as one of the top-ten economically strong cities in the country .  To meet the need of the state 's safety , Xiamen has initially built an industrial system , which can rapidly covert civilian production to defense technology industry .  Electronic , machine tool , and chemical industrial enterprises constitute a major part of this industrial system .  
The city has developed , in a selected and planned manner , more than 130 projects that can manufacture products both for military and civilian purposes .  To meet the need of military maneuvers , the city has repeatedly made such a conversion in an effort to turn sci-tech achievements into combat capability .  Now a total of 16 high-tech industrial enterprises are able to manufacture military articles to meet various needs at short notice .  
In the meantime , to meet the need of military combat readiness in the new period , they have integrated wartime and peacetime work , coordinated military and civilian affairs , and worked out an overall plan on building regional battlegrounds in cooperation with the troops stationed in the relevant region , by focusing on port , communication , and ship building .  
To meet with the " limited " strategic missile defense task requirements , the US Defense Department 's Ballistic Missile Defense Bureau has made , in line with the mass production principle , unified arrangements for the research projects of the TMD and NMD systems under the BMD plan .  The ultimate purpose is to enable these defense systems to coordinate with each other in combined operations , to jointly deal with a series of threats , and to provide a " nearly seamless defense network for the United States and for its allies " .  
Thus , fully making use of information technology , especially information network technology , to widen the space and channels of ideological and political work and create newer and more effective forms of ideological and political work that meet the characteristics of information exchange by the modern people should be a pressing issue that must be studied and tackled with concentrated efforts .  
On the basis of carrying on tradition , the college has updated its concepts according to the new changes in the new stage and eliminated the past curricular theme of cultivating specialized people with uniquely applicable courses.The college has developed a composite education based on universally applicable courses in order to cultivate " versatile people " that can meet the needs of modern wars .  
In the face of air threat under the modern high-tech conditions , the most practical issues lying before the air defense forces in making sound preparations for the military struggle are to create a new theory of operation , new contents of training , new methods of training , and a new ground antiaircraft operational command system by centering on " winning " the future war with anti-air raid as its main aspect so as to meet the needs of future anti-air raid operations .  
This sub-section has taken the lead in conducting this new method of joint tri-service transportation under modern operational conditions in the whole army to meet the needs of future military struggles since the formal initiation of the combined service system .  
The overall agricultural production level remains low .  Pang Daomu also maintained that Hunan may meet the following challenges : Hunan Province will probably suffer losses from disputes over some WTO-related issues due to its unfamiliarity with the rules governing the new game , its imperfect market economy , the differences between some of its policies and regulations and enterprises ' activities and the regulations of the WTO , the lack of understanding about WTO regulations , and the lack of experience .  
Cadres at the detachment level are required to master the knowledge and the command skills on more than three arms of the services within the scope of the brigade , and to meet the requirement of " being proficient in the professional work on their own posts , getting to know the work on nearby posts , and gaining an intimate knowledge of the work on related posts " ;  
Then we should build corresponding mathematical models and set up information-linkage relations among them .  In this way , it will be easy for us to carry out a systematic analysis on as well as a demonstration and proof of complicated commanding problems .  It is also helpful to form connecting ties between various links so as to meet the requirement of stability in command and control .  
To really practice Marxism , it is imperative to meet the requirements of the " three represents " that Comrade Jiang Zemin put forward recently , that is , our party should always represent the development needs of the China 's advance social productive forces , the onward direction of China 's advanced culture , and the fundamental interests of the largest number of the Chinese people .  
To meet the requirement for " managing officials strictly " , a large number of good cadres are needed who are firmly loyal to the party 's undertakings , extremely responsible for their work , cherish a bitter hatred for unhealthy trends , are righteous , upright , and outspoken , and have the courage to uphold principles when anything comes up .  
To meet the requirement for " being armed in two aspects " , members of party committees at all levels have continuously intensified their study .  However , in both the range and quality of their study and the conversion and application of the study results , they still fall short of the demand for " winning the war " .  More conspicuous are the inadequate study of military theories and military high-tech knowledge and the lack of versatile personnel .  
In the use of personnel , we should persist in the correct guidance of " using personnel to meet the need in war " , train versatile personnel who know both management and command and who have both rich knowledge and practice experience , have the courage to use outstanding young cadres with better education , moral character , ability , and performance , and improve the structure of leading bodies to raise their overall quality .  
The question as to which language is superior and which inferior is meaningless .  Dialects , like languages , differ from standard language in that they are used in a certain area ; they are spoken languages of an area and absolutely should not be considered low-class or backward , and they meet the requirements of day-to-day personnel exchanges in certain areas .  
We should seize the opportunity , meet challenges , lay stress on the key points , suit our measures to local conditions , grasp the key link and principal contradiction , concentrate our efforts on solving outstanding problems concerning the overall situation in the development of the region , and speed up the region 's economic and social development .  
Now , the initial form of socialist market economy has been established , but the historical mission of social system transition remains to be completed .  For example , some enterprises are still unable to meet the development demands of market economy , the operating mechanism is not active , the capability for technical innovation is not strong ;  
People have come to see that as a regional vehicle for promoting an open trade and an economic and technological cooperation , APEC has been moving at an extremely slow pace in exercising its latter function , and is now unable to meet the economic development needs of its member states in this aspect ; as for its former function , due to an unduly fast speed in the past , APEC has now found it difficult to take another step forward .  
During the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea in the early 1950s , Chinese military personnel had to fight against poison gas .  To meet the need of such an extremely severe situation , China 's anti-chemical scientific research institute , which was still being organized and established then , urgently began to develop the most needed poison-detecting equipment .  The curtain was then raised on the development of anti-chemical equipment for our armed forces .  
Both the north and the south have made firm steps toward the relaxation of tension and reconciliation on the peninsula .  Viewed from an historical angle , this is just the beginning of the long road toward peaceful reunification .  With the trend of easing tension and the acceleration in cooperation and exchange , the " agreement on truce " signed during the Cold War period can no longer meet the development and changes of the big trend in the international arena .  
Facing the challenges of the global military revolution and the rapid development of science and technology , only by incessant knowledge refreshment and quality enhancements can officers meet the requirements of winning future high-technology wars .  
Therefore , leaders and institution cadres at all levels , cadres of grassroots units and cadets should all take the management education as a compulsory course , study it hard , temper themselves in a painstaking manner , continuously improving their abilities in organizing , planning , and guiding troops through the management education , fully master the basic methods , meet the requirements for scientifically leading and correctly managing soldiers , and become qualified leaders of soldiers in the new period .  
In order to meet the needs of future combined operations , the US military emphasized that more joint or combined exercises should be organized in future , and in particular the proportion of political military exercises should be increased .  
in order to meet the need of maneuver of heavily equipped mass target under the condition of modern warfare , the unit has developed a group of capable personnel , equipment capable of guarding against infrared rays , and a series of thermal imaging camouflage equipment ;  
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy , we have been paying full attention to regulating people 's conduct with legal means in order to meet the requirements of developing the socialist market economy .  Meanwhile , rule by law has been defined as a basic strategy for ruling the country .  
These Interim Procedures were formulated to meet this urgent need taking the national and military situation at the present development stage into consideration so that these procedures are in harmony with national economic and social development , military construction and the direction in which procedures on resettling retired military cadres will develop .  
Therefore , for party organizations at all levels of our army , a most essential and most direct task in their implementation of " three represents " is to conscientiously implement the strategy of reinforcing the army and invigorating military training through science and technology , a strategy that has been put forward by the Central Military Commission ; strive to meet high standards in enhancing the fighting capacity of the troops ; pay close attention to training the troops through science and technology ;  
All Tthese reform all conform to the objective rules of the military 's economic administration under the socialist market economy , and meet the requirements of the national financial reform .  The implementation of these measures will substantially improve the scientific nature of the military spending budget administration and more fullyer allow the military spending budget-making to work as a macro-adjustment and control in our military modernization construction .  
Yang pointed out : With the deepening of the reform , the expansion of the opening up , and the establishment and development of a socialist market economic structure , China 's administrative and management structures have been reformed accordingly and marked results have been scored .  However , the problem of the current administrative and management structures being unable to completely meet the demands of the socialist market economy still exists .  
In recent years , leaders of the missile brigade , in order to meet the requirements of future war , have worked hard to master military skills , winning the reputation as the " bellwethers " in scientific and technical drills .  
In order to actively meet the requirements of the new situation and tasks and earnestly master features and laws , on the basis of making sufficient study and argumentation , the Central Military Commission and PLA General Departments have staged a series of new policies and regulations focusing on improving educational quality , conducting troop training in science and technology , strengthening the cultivation of cadres , implementing socialized safeguards , improving the work style of leaders , and so on .  
They should also be introduced if they meet relevant requirements .  In short , capable personnel are the basic conditions for doing any work .  As long as the recruitment of such capable personnel is conducive to the building of national defense and to the modernization of our armed forces , we should strive to recruit them without sticking to one pattern .  
Party committees and governments at all levels must provide the political and legal front with carefully selected cadres , who are ideologically and politically sound , proficient in professional work , bold and resolute , and able to meet the needs of the political and legal front , and strengthen the leading bodies at all levels of the political and legal front .  
However , to meet the need of its strategic objective of becoming the sole superpower dominating the world , the United States is still stubbornly sticking to the Cold War mentality and regards it as a basic method for handling and resolving international issues .  
Fu Quanyou expounded the development process and historical causes of the world 's new military revolution , analyzed the essential features and profound impact of the revolution , and explicitly put forth our Army 's major counter measures to meet the challenges from the world 's new military revolution .  
Doing a good job in selecting and promoting female cadres and recruiting more female party members is a need in our efforts to fulfill the new tasks under the new situation , to meet the " three represents " requirement , and to build a strong high-quality cadre contingent and to reinforce the party rank and file , and is also an important component part of our work in developing socialist democratic politics and promoting social progress .  
It is especially necessary to take effective policy measures to build and develop a contingent of high-level personnel and versatile personnel who can meet the needs of the new period , with the focus on training and absorbing capable personnel for making innovations , management and operation and on further creating a favorable environment for capable personnel who have returned from studying abroad to do pioneering work .  
Within the scope of the laws and policies and in accordance with the Islamic scriptures , the committee will make accurate and authoritative interpretations of the Islamic doctrine and canon which meet the need of the development of times , compile model books for sermons , and standardize contents of sermons , and enhance the level of work for the personnel in charge of Islamic religious affairs .  In addition , the committee will actively lead the religion to adapt to the socialist society by opposing religious extremist activities which make use of Islam .  
The western region 's economic development has been relatively slow ; the condition of its social base is poor , and the strategic logistical facilities have always been a weak link and have never been able to meet the new demands of military combats .  
As the great western development moves forward , and under the close cooperation among the state , the local governments , and the military , the western region 's infrastructure will be able to meet both social and national defense needs , so that the Chinese military 's strategic logistical facilities will have a solid foundation for achieving great development .  
On the one hand , the troops should participate in and support the ecological and environmental constructions , and on the other hand , they should take the lead to clean up the sources of pollution and focus on the comprehensive treatment of the garrisons ' everyday waste water , the oil-polluted water used to clean equipment , the waste water discharged from hospitals and clinics , and smoke and dust emission from boilers and so on to make sure that the sources of pollution will meet the emission and discharge standards after the treatment .  
To promote the sustained and healthy development of compulsory education in rural areas , we must concentrate on doing several jobs well in the future .  First , double the effort to build junior high schools in the countryside to meet a surge in demand for places in junior high schools as the number of children in the relevant age group hits a peak .  
Some countries that were affected by the 1997 financial crisis have learned experience and a lesson from the financial crisis , and , therefore , in recovering their economies , have placed greater importance on adopting a macroeconomic policy tailored to meet the actual situations .  The current ADB annual meeting also stressed the need to assist developing countries to carry out economic restructuring , enhance their macroeconomic regulation and control ability , and build and refine a social security system , in order to ensure relatively high economic growth in this region .  
Article 4 : The sponsors of a company planning to issue shares to be listed on the stock market shall meet the requirements stipulated in the " Company Law " and in other relevant laws and regulations .

We should accelerate the establishment of a social security system ; build up a reliable and stable fund-raising mechanism , as well as an effective and strict management mechanism , for the social security work ; and meet the target of " two ensures " in real terms by giving shape , as soon as possible , to a social security system which is independent of enterprises and institutions , which enjoys diversified sources of funds and a standardized security system , and which can provide socialized management services .  
According to Wang Jun , the Ministry of Finance has adjusted its internal mechanism and functions to meet the requirements of the establishment of the new fiscal expenditure management system this year after fully taking into consideration the needs of major financial reforms such as the unified control of budgetary and extra-budgetary funds and the establishment of a centralized system of receipt and payment by the Treasury .  
To further give play to the advantages and potential of cooperation between Asia and Europe in the economic and trade , financial , scientific and technological aspects , Premier Zhu set forth five important proposals : First , expanding trade , investment , and financial cooperation between Asia and Europe to meet the needs in the optimization of the industrial structure .  
All activities in connection with the ideological and political education must meet the basic requirements of the four kinds of education , namely , education in patriotic dedication , education in the revolutionary philosophy of life , education aimed at respecting cadres and loving soldiers , and education about the need for hard struggle .  
The theme is aiming at the future , and it is designed to reflect the latest developments and trends of the international and regional situation , meet the objective needs of Asian-Pacific regional cooperation , maintain continuity of the APEC work , respect the APEC 's principle of diversity and consensus through consultation , seek the converging point of the interests of all parties to the maximum extent , and promote common development and prosperity among all APEC members .  
The quality of the environment of surface water of various municipalities , provincial capitals , cities of special economic zones , coastal cities and key tourist cities must meet the state standards .  
Various localities should make conscientious efforts to build leading bodies at all levels , focusing on improving their ideological and political qualities , while working earnestly to meet the objectives and requirements set forth by the central authorities .  
( III ) In the face of the complex and changeable international situation and the new situation of various ideologies and cultures surging against each other and the contradictions and struggles in the ideological and political realm being very complicated , what to grasp and how to grasp the ideological and political building is an issue which has a bearing on what kind of mental outlook the Party , the country , and the military should meet for the challenges of the 21st Century .  
Our double-support work should meet the demand of the important thinking on the " three represents , " take the development of our social productive forces and the enhancement of our troops ' combat effectiveness as our fundamental starting point and standpoint .  We should follow the important principle of treating well the relations involving our army , government and civilians from the high plane of stressing politics , so that their unity will constantly consolidate and develop and make a still greater contribution to our reform , opening up and socialist modernization .  
To meet a city 's need of fighting against air raids in the future , Shanghai has insisted on using reform as a driving force in recent years .  It has adopted the method of enhancing comprehensive air defense ability as a fundamental starting point and base point .  It has made great efforts in organizing and building militia and reserve anti-aircraft units , in restructuring education and training programs for the units , and in providing weaponry for the units .  
Yu Yongbo said : To carry out the spirit of CMC Chairman Jiang Zemin 's instructions that the military should " fight to win " and " never change its nature " and to meet the requirements on our military officers posed by the new situation and tasks , new requirements that military officers must be " loyal to the CPC , and must have firm revolutionary ideal and conviction and possess modern military knowledge " are added to the basic requirements of military officers stipulated in the current regulations .  
To meet the new situation of reform of the system of cultivating and replenishing military officers and the need of the development of troop modernization building , the draft revision includes particular stipulations on the supply of military officers .  These stipulations include : outstanding enlisted personnel and graduates of ordinary secondary specialized schools can be promoted to officers only after they have studied in and graduated from a military academy ;  
At the threshold of the new century , he continued , it is necessary to enact a National Defense Education Law with Chinese characteristics by summing up our past experience with a view to development in the future .  This will meet the requirements of enhancing the national defense awareness of all people , building and consolidating our national defense , raising the quality of the entire people , promoting the coordinated development of defense and economic construction , and implementing the National Defense Law and Education Law .  
He also claimed that although the previous rectification drive has closed down many places of entertainment , there are still many fire precaution problems in such places , such as skimping on equipment work or reducing the materials , thus failing to meet the fire precaution standards ; and there are even cases of businesses opening without first being checked and accepted by the fire departments .  The most common problem is the blocking of fire exits , which is extremely dangerous .  
Third , it is necessary to always uphold the central task of economic development , sagaciously grasp the trend of the development of productive forces on a global scale while actively promoting the changes and adjustments of relations of production to meet the needs of the development of productive forces , promote institutional innovation and scientific and technological innovation , and seize the opportunity to turn the acceleration of development into the conscious action of the whole party .  
It must also help bring into play the initiative and creativeness of broadcast workers , help combine social benefits and economic benefits , help promote the sound and prosperous development of the broadcasting industry , and better meet the growing spiritual and cultural needs of the masses of the people .  
Pressured by recent developments , he was forced to lift restrictions on the direct exchange of goods and people between the two islands of Jinmen [ Kinmen ] and Mazu [ Matsu ] and coastal Fujian . However , this is not direct " three links " in the real sense of the word and can not meet the strong desire and pressing demand of the people on both sides of the Strait . It also lags behind the objective situation of growing cross-Strait personnel and economic exchanges .  
Being forced by the development of the situation , the Taiwan authorities could not but make such an " opening . "  This was not direct " three links " in real terms , and could not meet the strong desire and the urgent need of the people on both sides of the strait .  Such an action lagged far behind the objective situation in which personnel exchanges and economic and trade exchanges between the two sides are increasing drastically day by day .  
Thus , the Taiwan side may possibly ask for procuring Kidd-class destroyers before the opening of the annual US-Taiwan arms sales negotiations scheduled to be held in April . If this is really true , newly elected President Bush will meet , for the first time , a grim challenge in handling the subtle military balance between " China " and Taiwan .  
Efforts should be made to constantly meet peasants ' pressing requirements for agricultural science and technology , which should be regarded as the fundamental point of departure and destination of our agricultural scientific and technological work , set up and amplify a number of agricultural scientific and technological bases which come up to the international standards , and train a contingent of high-quality agricultural scientific and technological personnel . 
If we are unable to achieve breakthroughs in the progress of agricultural science and technology , it will be hard to enhance the comprehensive productive forces in agriculture and agricultural competitiveness , and it will then be hard to meet the demands of all-round building of a comfortably well-off living standard .  
We must vigorously propagate and popularize scientific knowledge , scientific thinking , and scientific methods ; guide the masses of cadres in building scientific , civilized , and healthy social trends and fine lifestyles ; and constantly meet the growing cultural needs of the masses of peasants , thereby promoting the two civilizations in the rural area .  
As we enter the new century , faced with the trend of economic globalization and fierce competition , and faced with the progress of science and technology which is changing with each passing day , the compatriots on both sides of the strait should all the more link hands in cooperation to meet the challenges together and make both of them winners in mutual benefit in the economy and in science and technology .  
In order to survive and develop in face of the fierce international competition after China 's WTO entry and the gradual financial integration in the world , China 's large enterprises have continuously quickened their pace for restructuring .  They have also gone overseas to list their shares and enhanced their actual strength to meet international challenges .  
The direct cause of the inability to reduce farmers ' burden is that township financial budgets have to support too great a population , have to meet goals and upgrade in various activities , and complete " cosmetic projects " which can not be halted despite repeated attempts to do so .  This leaves townships with weak financial budgets and a heavy debt load .  
Since opening and reform were implemented , China 's rural operating system has undergone fundamental changes , but administrative system reform has lagged behind , meaning it could not meet the demands of rural market economic development .  
In the face of WTO challenges , such as increased imports and foreign advanced marketing methods , Wang Jinshan said , supply and marketing cooperatives departments and affiliated organizations nationwide should make use of their limited time to further intensify reform , quicken the pace of development , and meet challenges with a positive posture .  
The economists held that the current financial system in our country can not meet the requirements of getting accession into the World Trade Organization . In particular , the state-owned commercial banks will be facing sterner challenges , and the issue of bad assets will become more serious .  It is necessary to explore an effective and feasible solution .  
We must actively meet the new demands of the contemporary economic , science , technology , and social development , and speed up the establishment and perfection of a complete set of systems and mechanisms that are indispensable to developing the socialist market economy .  
We must persistently strive to meet the requirements of the " three represents " and without wavering carry forward the party 's fine tradition and work style .  We must do a better job in carrying forward our party 's work style of seeking truth from facts , integrating theory with practice , establishing close ties with the people , carrying out criticism and self-criticism , being modest and prudent , guarding against arrogance and rashness , and working hard .  
Let us rally more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , meet the requirements of the important thinking of the " three represents " in an all-round way , enhance our vigor and vitality , forge ahead in a pioneering and enterprising spirit , work in a down-to-earth manner , and exert ourselves in the struggle to achieve the goal of the 10th Five-year Plan and build an affluent , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country !  
At the same time , it also warned the handful of " Taiwan independence " diehards not to go against the tide of history and not to take political risks with the well-being and future of Taiwan compatriots as their chips out of ulterior motives , for this is very dangerous .  Doing so would only bring a huge disaster to the people of Taiwan and is bound to meet with resolute opposition from all Chinese people , including the Taiwan compatriots .  
We stress the importance of unleashing and developing productive forces and building an advanced culture , but the purpose of all this is , in the final analysis , to realize , develop , and safeguard the people 's interests and continuously meet the ever-increasing material and cultural demands of the general public .  
Only when a stable political and social environment is maintained can the Hong Kong citizens live and work in peace and happiness , carry out normal economic activities , steadily meet emergency and seek progress in the increasingly fierce international economic competition , and remain invincible .  
The main reasons for China to increase its national defense spending this year is to ensure that the living standard of the servicemen will improve simultaneously with social and economic development and with the increase in the average income of urban and rural residents , and to meet the needs of the modernization of national defense and the reform of the military management structure .  
We should strategically adjust the layout of state-owned economy to meet the demand of improving overall quality of the economy , and persist in encouraging , supporting and guiding the healthy development of individual and private economy while adhering to the principle of keeping public ownership in the dominant position .  
We should make it our objective to increase the income of urban and rural population and constantly meet the people 's material and cultural needs , and vigorously promote the comprehensive development of the national economy and social undertakings .  
Zeng Qinghong stressed : We must push forward in depth the study and education activity on the important thinking of " three represents " in rural areas , strive to meet the prescribed targets in real terms , and further make people 's ideological understanding on the activity conform to the requirements of the central authorities .  
It is necessary to act according to the guiding principle of widening the field of vision , extensively selecting talented people , promoting exchanges , optimizing structures , intensifying training , enhancing quality , strengthening management , perfecting supervision , and basing ourselves on reality , but having our eyes on the future to strive to build up a high-quality contingent of diplomats stationed in foreign countries which can meet the needs of the new century and new tasks .  
In the new century , international competition will get more and more intense , the reform and construction tasks at home will also be heavy and arduous .  The objective conditions are continuously changing .  If we do not emancipate our minds , do not carry out innovations , then our cause will not be advanced further , and we will not able to meet various challenges .  
We face keen competition in trade and services , and our competitiveness is threatened by persistently high inflation .  We have to resolve a series of social problems arising from a growing and ageing population , meet the pressing demand for more and better housing , and deal with employment dislocation due to re-structuring of the economy .  All these require urgent attention and careful handling .  
" The success of this two-pronged approach is evidenced by the fact that we have not only raised sufficient revenue to meet our spending needs but we have also built up a very healthy level of fiscal reserves . 
Noting that these were but a few examples of Hong Kong 's financial market development in the foreseeable future , he said the Government was committed to ensure that the software and hardware of our financial infrastructure were enhanced and sustained at the world-class level to meet challenges in the coming century . 
It is reported that the Social Welfare Department has cut the number of new recruits due to a slow down in the growth of social welfare spending this year , and this has resulted in a number of social service programmes failing to meet the set targets .

At the same time , the Bill will seek to empower the Director of Housing to contract out the premium assessment work of subsidised home ownership flats to qualified private estate surveyors to meet the anticipated workload and to shorten the time required when these flats can be disposed of in the open market after the expiry of the 10-year resale restriction period .  
Among these initiatives are building not less than 85,000 flats a year in the public and private sectors , starting from 1999-2000 , as a long-term target to meet the future needs of the community ; achieving a home ownership rate of 70% by 2007 ; and reducing the average waiting time for public rental housing to three years by 2005 .  
Mr Tsang said he had to find the balance under which we could take forward the new policy programme that the Chief Executive had laid down , meet the ambitious investment programme , advance the social objectives and strengthen Hong Kong 's competitiveness , while giving assurance that our public finances would remain stable . 
In the coming academic year , the Institute will organise undergraduate and part-time taught postgraduate programmes to promote the continuing and professional development of teachers .

The Five-Year Land Disposal Programme ( 1998 / 99 to 2002 / 03 ) is designed to implement the Government 's long - standing policy to provide adequate land to meet the economic and social needs of Hong Kong , having regard to the prevailing market conditions and the underlying factors which give rise to forecast demand over time .

On the other hand , the experts of the Provisional Urban Council have made great contributions in studying Hong Kong 's history and preserving invaluable historical relics .

This will increase our total annual committed expenditure on residential care by an estimated $ 670 million .  
" For existing karaoke establishments operating under a valid licence , we are prepared to waive the requirement for further widening their corridors to 1.2 metres to meet the new standards , if the minimum corridor width is already 1.05 metres and if such establishments have already installed basic fire safety measures which have been approved by the authorities , " he said .  
A total of 38 new secondary schools will also be built in the four school years from 1999-2000 at a capital cost of $ 3.89 billion to meet the demand for additional school places .  The full year additional recurrent expenditure is $ 1.38 billion .  
For applications of similar quality that meet the above conditions , Mr Kwong said the following factor would be considered favourably : potential tenants in the information services sector which bring to Hong Kong their head office or regional headquarters , the level of investment per square metre over the first five years of tenancy , and the percentage of head-count in the Cyberport employing professional and technical staff .  
To meet this objective , we may need to consider steering away from the past approach in which urban renewal had been conducted in a piecemeal manner .  Instead , we will plan urban renewal and rehabilitation more comprehensively for larger areas , with a view to more effectively restructuring and re-planning the old urban areas , re-designing a more effective and environmentally friendly transport and road network , replacing incompatible land uses , adding open space , and designing buildings which meet the demands of modern living .

Mr Ip said , " Hong Kong is ideally located to meet this objective , because of the critical mass already here , our strengths in shipping finance and P &amp; amp ; I Club , the cluster of local shipowners , and maritime administration based on the UK model , and more so , an extremely business friendly environment and Government , not to mention Hong Kong 's position as the gateway to Mainland China , one of the largest maritime countries in the world with considerable potential for expansion .

There will be tremendous resistance to any change in a marital relationship . Women in rural areas need to resolve these issues .

At Kaohsiung High , which is the most selective school in the Kaohsiung-Pingtung testing zone , quite a few of the students find the textbooks hard to follow . They are so difficult and obscure because their editors designed them to meet the needs of a small group of truly gifted students .  
In that way a small minority of gifted students could enter schools where the curriculum is specifically tailored to meet their needs . But it is n't necessary to make entrance exams exceedingly abstruse just so it is possible to distinguish these students . " There are theoretical bases behind both district high school systems and selective high school systems , and both have their strong points , " says Yang Jen-hsiao , principal of NTNU Affiliated High .  
Buddhism and Taoism seemed less useful than Confucianism in resolving worldly problems .

For example , prior to the Song dynasty , The Great Learning was not a very influential work in China .

In fact , my country has noted with deep regret that while some developed countries have been making efforts to meet the official development assistance level , such assistance from some rich countries has been declining noticeably , and the decline has been taking place in the post-cold-war era , when it was to be expected that such countries were in a better position to increase the flow of official development assistance as a result of greater stability in the world and reduced tensions between former antagonists .  
That programme , which is supported by the international financial institutions with which we have worked out clear-cut modalities for negotiation and cooperation , will enable us better to meet an economic and social future that will be more promising and that will better favour the integration of the Haitian economy into the world scene .  
For in fact the resources allocated to cooperation for development have fallen , on the pretext that up to now this has achieved nothing for the beneficiary countries , including our countries in Africa , whose priorities , at both national and continental level , have been to relieve absolute , endemic poverty , to eradicate hunger and malnutrition , to overcome disease and illiteracy , and to meet the needs for housing and sanitation .  
Rural development and prosperity-decentralization in the region have been expedited by building up economic and social basic services to catalyse sustainable rural development and by expanding the quality and quantity of basic services to meet the local demands of the country .  
In particular , the Agency has rendered valuable assistance , both technical and material , to developing countries to meet their special needs in the application of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and economic development .  
Mindful of the necessity to avoid a political impasse , it is essential that we all approach the process we are engaged in in a positive manner and continue to actively explore creative and constructive ideas on how to meet the various concerns involved .  
We need to close ranks to meet the major challenges that can face democracy , such as poverty and all it entails , the spectre of ethnic conflict , illicit drug trafficking , international terrorism , religious fanaticism , the spread of the AIDS pandemic , the ravages of malaria , and so forth .  
In strengthening and modernizing the United Nations , the emphasis has to be on enhancing legitimacy , addressing inequities in decision-making processes and promoting efficiency and effectiveness better to meet the changing , complex needs of Members . The ultimate objective of reform can not be reduced to cutting costs or just addressing the current financial crisis .  
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
Stresses that Governments , in partnership with civil society and all other development actors , including non-governmental organizations and people living in poverty and their organizations should cooperate to meet the basic human needs of all - inter alia , income , resources , education , health care , nutrition , shelter , sanitation and safe water - in particular of people living in poverty and vulnerable and disadvantaged groups ;  
Stresses the need for Governments and relevant international institutions or organizations to examine how the rapid globalization of the world economy and the increased liberalization of trade is affecting the ability of States to design and implement effective strategies for eradicating poverty and to provide a stable legal framework that creates an enabling environment to achieve social development and to meet the basic human needs of all , in order to prevent greater inequality between different sectors of society ;  
As far as the energy-deficient developing countries are concerned , to meet this challenge and to arrest their ever-increasing dependence on imported energy , mainly oil , it will be necessary to accelerate exploration and development of indigenous energy resources and to develop greater capacity for producing commercial primary energy : oil , natural gas , coal , hydropower and other new and renewable sources of energy .  
Many developing countries are already burdened by high oil import bills ; therefore any new and additional supply from indigenous energy resources would greatly contribute towards the relief of this burden .  NULLA major problem facing most developing countries now , and one they will be facing increasingly in the future , is that of mobilizing the capital necessary to meet their growing energy requirements , against a background of stagnant multilateral loans and grants and falling official development assistance .  
It has also proposed a joint mission of high-level representatives of international and regional organizations to visit Somalia and to meet with all relevant personalities and factions to convey the resolve of the international organizations to assist the Somali people and to express the hope that a conference on national reconciliation may be convened at any venue of their choice .  
Bildt was invited to meet the NAC on 17 January where he acknowledged the efficient deployment of IFOR and the adequacy of the Peace Agreement structures , outlined the important civilian tasks ahead and emphasized that reconciliation between all the parties was the key to a stable and lasting peace .  
The idea of triangular funding , by which the financial resources of developed countries could be used to acquire the appropriate technical resources of developing countries in order to meet the needs of other developing countries , received universal endorsement from all delegations .  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Calls upon the international community to meet all the objectives as reaffirmed in chapter 34 of Agenda 21 , 5 / in particular those dealing with effective access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies , including new and emerging technologies and publicly owned technologies , to developing countries on favourable terms , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed , taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights as well as the special needs of developing countries , so as to contribute to enabling those developing countries to meet their development-related challenges ;  
It combines the challenge of security for all the basic human need of a reliable supply of safe drinking water and meeting the competing demands from industry and agriculture , which are crucial to economic development and food security , without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their water needs .  
Following a technical consultation involving India and Pakistan that had been held at Vienna in July 1994 under the auspices of UNDCP , the Governments of those two States had agreed to meet at regular intervals at the policy and operational levels to review and determine common approaches on drug-related problems affecting their common borders , such as the movement of precursors and trafficking in heroin and other drugs , as well as to establish systems for the regular and systematic exchange of operational information .  
To strengthen their support for actions at the national level and to enhance their contributions to an integrated and coordinated follow-up by the United Nations , specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system should identify the specific actions they will undertake to meet the priorities identified in the Global Plan of Action .  
A limited number of industrialized countries can both meet their domestic needs for scientific and technical information and be active partners in international efforts .  
The historical and current contribution to energy-related global environmental impacts by developing countries is low , but is expected to increase with accelerated economic and social development to meet the demands of their expanding population .  
Therefore , even if the formula percentage can be revised upwards sufficiently at this time to generate enough income for the support account to finance the estimated expenditure requirements for backstopping for the 12-month period from 1 July 1996 , it is the Secretary-General \ x { e5b8 } conclusion that based on past experience it has been clearly demonstrated that the current funding methodology does not reflect the actual backstopping capacity required and does not provide an adequate and predictable annual level of resources to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters .  
The Secretary-General strongly believes that adoption of this approach would provide the Secretariat with the adequate , assured and predictable annual level of resources necessary to meet the minimum backstopping requirements at Headquarters , which the current funding methodology and formula has not .  
In the interest of current government efforts to meet the complex development challenges of dealing with the impact of increasing globalization and the expanding role of the market and private sector and of eliminating poverty and promoting social justice , protecting the environment and supporting participatory democracy , the need for a fundamental review of the role of public administration in development is urgent and apparent now more than ever .  
For the past 45 years , pursuant to its various legislative mandates , the United Nations programme in public administration and finance has sought to meet the expressed needs of developing countries in improving their administrative and financial management systems for development .  
It is recommended that the United Nations programme attach high priority in assisting Governments , at their request , in the development and updating of high-level technical or analytical skills within the pubic service to meet the new challenges posed by globalization of the economies , technological advances , and the growing importance of the civil society .  
Specifically , to meet the urgent emerging responsibilities of training in economic management , people-centred development and public policy analysis , adequate resources need to be provided to upgrade the capacity of national training institutions , to develop a core group of professional trainers and to prepare training materials and case studies through independent research , consultancy and networking arrangements .  
International measures to strengthen the implementation of the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space , including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies should be encouraged further , together with international cooperation in the development in the States concerned of indigenous capacities for conducting peaceful activities in outer space that would meet their priority needs .  In that spirit , India strongly supported various of the proposals before the Subcommittee on outer space benefits .  
Although the minimum qualifications required - eight years policing experience , ability to communicate in English and driving skills - have been specified to Governments , the number of those who failed to meet the criteria and to pass the required elementary tests upon arrival in the theatre has risen to alarming levels .  
Stress the need to develop a greater range of more attractive positive measures , such as effective instruments to facilitate financial and technology transfers to developing countries in order to assist them to meet multilaterally agreed targets , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility ; and recommend that positive measures are preferable to the threat of the use of trade restrictions to secure compliance with the objectives of the MEA .  
Where alternative programmes target special population groups , however , their success rate is high , equal to the peer-led programmes and with better results than conventional drug education programmes . 35 The successful programmes are those that have been individualized to meet the needs of each client and those that have included activities to enhance personal competence , such as reading skills and job skills , as well as physical adventure .  
Thus , while the Advisory Panel has traditionally met once a month , it recently agreed to meet twice monthly , one meeting to address immediate and ongoing management and financial issues , and the other meeting to be devoted to discussions of major policy issues and the development of strategic directives .  
To meet these challenges , which were exacerbated by budgetary constraints , the Department streamlined its organizational structure , consolidated its resources and established or strengthened existing links with media organizations and other organizations .  
Nuclear safety can also be enhanced by greater international transparency in nuclear power activities , in particular by means of peer reviews , and this should lead to existing reactors that do not meet current safety requirements being brought to an acceptable level of safety or ceasing operation .  
To meet growing information needs in a changing political environment with limited resources , the implementation of the programme requires the closest cooperation with substantive departments , other offices of the Secretariat and the specialized agencies , programmes and funds of the United Nations system for the development of coordinated mechanisms to feed and link database and other records .  
It is anticipated that the implementation of this programme will lead to a greater understanding of the principles and objectives of the United Nations , as well as to the enhancement of its image as an effective Organization capable of carrying out the tasks mandated by the General Assembly and directed by the Secretary-General , and , above all , as an Organization capable of making substantive contributions to meet the needs of the peoples of the world and challenges posed by a rapidly changing international environment .  
The Secretary-General trusts that the additional information provided herein will allow the General Assembly to establish the minimum predictable annual level of support account resources needed to meet the backstopping requirements at Headquarters by endorsing , at its second resumed session , his proposals , 1 / which were based on the outcome of the comprehensive review .  
The driving forces behind increasingly serious water problems include rapid world population growth - in terms of both rapid urbanization and rural populations growing beyond local carrying capacity - and rising expectations and dependence on reliable water-related services to meet social needs , economic activity and food production .  
The representative of the Centre explained the primary goal and objectives of the five-year project : to help the organization better meet the current and diverse demands placed on it in matters relating to peace and security and humanitarian and human rights affairs ; to help the United Nations system to meet the new and dramatic challenges of the future ; to strengthen cooperation and coordination among the system partners ; and to help the United Nations organization to meet the calls for reform , accountability and flexibility .  
During the visit , I was able to meet with the local political leadership and express support for those who seek to implement the Peace Agreement and its vision of a single multi-ethnic country , two entities peacefully coexisting and elections that are free and fair .  
Many of the countries that currently tacitly approved illegal migration to meet labour shortages needed to ensure that real demand for imported labour was met through legal channels which afforded protection to the migrants and recognized their genuine rights .  
A cooperative is an autonomous association of persons united voluntarily to meet their common economic , social and cultural needs and aspirations through a jointly owned and democratically controlled enterprise .  
While there appears to be general agreement on sustainability criteria , it has become increasingly clear that indicators , through which progress is monitored over time , must be tailored to meet specified economic , environmental , social and cultural conditions , operating within institutional , legal and policy frameworks specific to individual countries .  
If sustainable forest management as conceptualized at the international level is to be widely implemented at the national level on a lasting basis , international solidarity in the sharing of technologies , know-how and information and in making resources available to meet common needs must receive increased attention .  
At the same time , the ministers reaffirmed the important need for continued and intensified international support , especially for efforts to halt the proliferation of weapons in Central Africa , to diffuse potentially catastrophic situations and to meet the critical humanitarian needs of millions of refugees and displaced persons in the area .  
While the global Secretariat relies on its existing staff to carry out its established work programme and implement the various mandates entrusted to it , it does occasionally experience the need for supplementing established staffing resources on a short-term basis to respond to specific mandates or requests from Member States , or to meet the demands of peak periods in areas subject to sharp and often unpredictable workload fluctuations .  
The pool of non-retirees , particularly for specific language combinations and / or functions , is limited for two reasons : first , the Organization must ensure that the freelancers it recruits meet the same high standards required of established language staff ; and , second , the United Nations must compete on the freelance market with other organizations both within and outside the common system who in some cases can be more stable or financially advantageous sources of employment .  
The goal of a national forest programme is to ensure the conservation , management and sustainable development of forests to meet local , national , regional and global needs and requirements , by fostering national and international partnerships for the benefit of present and future generations .  
Although there may be an increasing scarcity of tropical hardwood resources , particularly given current rates of exploitation and consumption in South-east Asia , temperate and boreal resources , secondary forests and plantations , and new tropical hardwood resources in Latin America and Africa are expected to meet any global shortfalls in supply .  
A properly designed , voluntary and independently accredited certification scheme at the global level can be a means by which the various interested parties can hold producers accountable ; it can provide a market-based incentive to the individual producer to improve management ; it can meet consumer demands for wood from well-managed forests without creating trade discriminations ; and it can be a mechanism for monitoring multiple factors involved in forest use .  
The Department 's Web site is designed to meet the information needs of delegations and participants : it is providing advanced information and texts of the parliamentary documentation of the economic and social bodies , and numerous links to other national and international sources of information .  
In the light of the very positive collaboration experienced by members of the Joint Committee through the Task Force on Information Activities for the Social Summit , convened by the Department of Public Information , it was agreed that the Joint Committee would establish a working group in New York which would meet monthly or bimonthly , as required .  
There have been financial losses of some $ 890-million owing to the non-implementation of letters of credit in , for example , the importation of ready-made clothing and shoes , milk and other baby food , electric and other domestic appliances , spare parts , home and office furniture , and other essential goods imported from abroad to meet the consumption needs of the local market ;  
Many of the countries that currently tacitly approved illegal migration to meet labour shortages needed to ensure that real demand for imported labour was met through legal channels which afforded protection to the migrants and recognized their genuine rights .  
The objective of eradicating absolute poverty required a broad range of policies and actions at all levels : an appropriate economic framework based on sound macroeconomic policies ; a well-developed infrastructure ; strengthened institutions and capacity ; as well as programmes designed to meet basic human needs ;  
Other key events that created volatility in the currency and financial markets included the derivative losses incurred by established institutions and corporations , the Mexican financial crisis , which affected emerging markets in general , the strength of the yen against the dollar , and the continued struggle by the European Union to meet the convergence criteria for economic and monetary union .  
In addition , the Council decided that " the Group should meet for a period of two weeks not more than once a year and should report to the Commission on Transnational Corporations on further steps to be taken in pursuit of the long-term objective of the international harmonization of accounting and reporting within the scope of the work of the Commission , particularly with regard to the comprehensive information system and the code of conduct on transnational corporations currently being formulated , on the understanding that duplication of work should be avoided " .  
Such measures should help the least developed countries to meet their obligations under the said agreements ; to secure financial , technical and technological support , as agreed in the relevant agreements ; and to secure compensation for losses they have suffered during implementation of the said agreements .  
Just a few years ago , Nicaragua maintained a large army and devoted a large part of its national budget to meet high military expenditures , to the detriment of its economic and social development .  Just a few years ago , many of you , and even we ourselves , were looking with sceptism at the possibility of peace reigning in Nicaragua or of the country enjoying full liberty .  
The GEF provides new and additional grants and funding to meet the incremental costs of measures to achieve global environmental benefits in four focal areas : ( a ) the protection of biological diversity , ( b ) the reduction of greenhouse gases , ( c ) the protection of international waters , and ( d ) the protection of the ozone layer .  
The Committee also agreed with the Secretary-General 's view that efforts to ensure that the United Nations was equipped to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century depended on , above all , continuous , predictable and assured political and financial support from Member States .  
Recognize that the provision of sufficient energy services at affordable prices and the adoption of energy conservation measures are essential for the progress of all countries , developed and developing alike , to meet current and expanding needs in ways that minimize environmental degradation and risks , as well as to realize the full potential of renewable energy sources ;  
It is important that an effective mechanism be established , so that international actors and the authorities can discuss issues of common concern on a regular basis , share information on current activities and take joint decisions , especially on how best to meet the needs of vulnerable groups .  
In resolution 1996 / 54 , the Commission , inter alia , commended the continued operation in Cambodia of the office of the Centre for Human Rights ; welcomed the report of the Secretary-General on the role of the Centre ; recognized the seriousness with which the Government of Cambodia has approached the preparation of its initial reports to the relevant treaty bodies , and encouraged the Government to continue its efforts to meet its reporting obligations under international human rights instruments , drawing on the assistance of the office in Cambodia of the Centre for Human Rights ;  
Also decides that the preparatory process for the special session of the General Assembly should be funded through the regular budget of the United Nations , bearing in mind the need to keep financial costs to a minimum , and that Governments should be invited to make extrabudgetary contributions to meet those costs ;  
While it was gratifying to note that the percentage of women in posts subject to geographical distribution had risen by 1 per cent over the past year , his delegation was concerned that , because of the financial crisis , it had been difficult for the Organization to meet its targets for the percentage of women in decision-making and policy-making posts .  
On 7 October , as part of regular consultations , the Transitional Administrator met with President Slobodan Milo \ x { ea92 } vi _ , who expressed full support for UNTAES , undertook to meet with local hardline Serb leaders to urge them to cooperate with UNTAES and stated his wish to see an extension of the mandate for an additional year .  
In providing the financial resources needed by developing country Parties to meet the agreed full incremental costs of implementing measures covered by Article 4.1 of the Convention in accordance with Article 4.3 , take steps to facilitate this provision of financial resources , including the enhancement of transparency and the flexible and pragmatic application of its concept of incremental costs on a case-by-case basis ;  
The group of experts on marine and coastal biodiversity , established pursuant to decision II / 10 of the Second Conference of Parties , has not been able to meet as planned ; however , the first step has been achieved in drawing up a roster of nominated experts from which the group will be composed .  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty and stresses at the same time , that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacity to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,

In considering applications on a case-by-case basis , the Committee viewed as inappropriate requests to supply industrial equipment and raw materials , as well as horticultural produce , except fruits and vegetables , to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , unless such applications contained , in every case , specific explanations of how the commodities and products in question were intended to meet essential humanitarian needs ( see press release SC / 6118 ) .  
Planning to meet requirements and the design and erection of decent and socially acceptable lodgings represents an extremely complex and expensive task inasmuch as , to cope with the problem of refugees arriving in unpredictable numbers , with major peaks , account has to be taken of economic possibilities and of the limited land areas and premises available , while also avoiding conflicts with the population and among the refugees themselves and taking into consideration local political interests .  
Expresses its concern at the continuing violations of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran , in particular the high number of executions in the absence of guarantees of due process of law , cases of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , the failure to meet international standards with regard to the administration of justice , violations of the right to peaceful assembly and restrictions on the freedom of expression , thought , opinion and the press ;  
Finally , once the target has been identified , a plan of action needs to be developed to meet the objective ; section III thus gives an integrated presentation of ISWGNA work programmes , highlighting recent achievements and reviewing proposed priority areas for future work in the light of expressed country needs .  
In those circumstances UNRWA was forced to perform new tasks which had been entrusted to it after the beginning of the peace process , in particular to meet the growing humanitarian needs , ensure the necessary level of services to the Palestinian population , sometimes in extremely difficult circumstances , facilitate the advancement of the peace process with the help of investment and job creation projects , help establish Palestinian State bodies in the autonomous areas and meet the growing needs despite a reduction in budgetary resources .  
As is now the case for permanent appointments , the career track appointments would be subject to termination for abolition of post , reduction of staff , on health grounds , for failure to meet the requisite level of performance and for disciplinary reasons . 10 With respect to performance , the new performance appraisal system will allow for a full annual review which would render redundant the review now conducted at the end of the first five years of service under a permanent appointment . 
In order to meet the increasing demand for the participation of civilian police in United Nations peacekeeping operations , as well as their enhanced role in fostering the political reconciliation process and the promotion of peace between warring factions , the Secretary-General will address this issue in the context of future budgetary proposals , as appropriate .

" 
Those measures included the introduction of a human resources management planning function which would enable the Secretariat to project staff needs and design training to meet those needs ; the introduction of performance management through the Performance Appraisal System ; the introduction of people management training designed to enable managers and supervisors to have a better understanding of and to take responsibility for the staff entrusted to them ; and the initial development of a management assignment programme for P-2 and P-3 staff recruited through the national competitive examination process .  
Much remained to be done to advance the cause in terms of the tasks assigned to the Commissions and expert meetings , for the main challenge ahead was to perfect a pragmatic approach that would enable the international community to deal with the development problem in a globalized world economy and to endow UNCTAD with efficient and modern instruments for helping the developing countries to meet this challenge .  
Expresses its concern at the continuing violations of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran , in particular the high number of executions in the absence of guarantees of due process of law , cases of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , the failure to meet international standards with regard to the administration of justice , violations of the right to peaceful assembly and restrictions on the freedom of expression , thought , opinion and the press ;

ARMITAGE ( Australia ) said that his country acknowledged the obligation of Member States , under Article 101 of the Charter , to ensure the conditions of service necessary to meet the objective of a highly competent , professional and independent international civil service .  
It was hard to reconcile calls made by delegations for equitable geographical distribution with a situation in which the vast majority of staff members , including many whose professional qualifications did not meet the high standards of the international civil service , enjoyed permanent status .  
This data will be utilized by OHRM 's human resources planning specialist to project external recruitment needs sufficiently in advance as to allow National Competitive Examinations to target occupational groupings of staff to meet the current and anticipated2 needs of the Organization , while addressing as well equitable geographical distribution concerns .  
The Inspectors ' references to such provisions as " identifying women candidates who meet the minimum qualifications for any vacant post " and measures to limit to internal circulation vacancy announcements where " fully qualified and suitable women candidates have already been identified from within the Organization or from the roster or another direct source of recruitment " are taken out of context as a demonstration of " reverse discrimination " .  
While retaining its great ability for political and financial mobilization and intensive , joint work with Governments , UNICEF , under the excellent leadership of Ms . Carol Bellamy , and with a renewed mandate , is focusing on supporting Government efforts to settle outstanding issues , consolidate the gains that it has already achieved and work more effectively to meet present and future challenges .

Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
Supporting fully the efforts of the International Tribunal aimed at the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991 , and demanding that States and parties to the Peace Agreement meet their obligations to cooperate fully with the Tribunal , as required by Security Council resolutions 827 ( 1993 ) of 25 May 1993 and 1022 ( 1995 ) of 22 November 1995 , including with respect to surrendering persons sought by the Tribunal ,  
Regional cooperation should be encouraged through the development of a common strategic framework for the exploitation of opportunities involving space technologies to meet regional needs , including the networking of existing and planned national and regional centres of excellence .  
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;

Ukraine had always supported the creation of an international criminal court and was ready to participate actively in the future work , in the hope that the international community would demonstrate enough political will to meet what was an historic challenge .  
In its deliberations , the Commission noted the interest that BOT and other forms of private participation in public infrastructure projects had raised in many States , in particular in developing countries , as the successful implementation of such projects would enable States to achieve significant savings in public expenditure and to re-allocate resources that otherwise would have been invested in infrastructure in order to meet more pressing social needs .  
Acknowledges the contribution of Secretary-General Dr .  Boutros Boutros-Ghali to international peace , security and development , his exceptional efforts to solve international problems in economic , social and cultural fields , as well as his endeavours to meet humanitarian needs and to promote and encourage respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all ;  
Part four , ( Census products and data utilization ) is designed , in part , to serve as an introduction to users who are unfamiliar with population and housing censuses as a source to meet their needs for demographic and social statistics and , in part , to provide some of the indicators needed to monitor progress on the goals identified in the plans of action adopted by various international conferences held in the 1990s .  
Thus , while the Advisory Panel has traditionally met once a month , it recently agreed to meet twice monthly , one meeting to address immediate and ongoing management and financial issues and the other meeting to be devoted to discussions of major policy issues and the development of strategic directives .  
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
It can only be achieved through a multidimensional and integrated approach , that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities , public services , and enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
Indeed , increased cooperation between the two organizations will , we hope , make it possible to establish the foundations for international cooperation that is free from ideological confrontation and resolutely determined to meet its global challenges : economic and social development ; strengthening democracy and respect for human rights ; the promotion of sustainable development while taking account of the need for environmental conservation ; the struggle against the scourge of drugs ; and the promotion of gender equality .  
This is not to mention bolstering the role of institutions and charitable organizations , notably the Zayed charitable organization and the Red Crescent , as well as other organizations , aimed at helping them achieve their humanitarian objectives for the purpose of mobilizing local efforts in the public and private sectors , and meeting appeals to meet human needs and emergency demands in parts of the world that have been affected or are impoverished .  
We also urge them to institute national projects and programmes to meet the demand of international public opinion for promotion of the spirit of brotherhood , tolerance and love ; rejection of violence ; collective responsibility for guaranteeing fundamental human rights for all , regardless of nationality , race , or religious or ethnic affiliation ; and allowing peoples to live in peace and stability .  
The objective of sustainable development should be the integration of environmental , economic and social policies in order to meet basic human needs and to manage the environment on a sustainable basis .  
The main objective of this doctrine is the gradual realization of a global civil society , a society where liberty and salvation harmoniously coincide to meet the spiritual and material needs of humanity in an institutionalized manner , and where comprehensive , balanced and sustainable development lies at the foundation of universal cooperation and participation .  
The European Union has often stated that the crisis can not be resolved until all Member States have agreed to meet their obligations under the United Nations Charter in full by settling their arrears and by paying on time and without conditions the full amount of their mandatory contributions to the Organization 's regular budget and to the budget of peacekeeping operations . 
It bears in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy .

The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) launched a global partnership on environment and development , which acknowledged that sustained economic growth , the eradication of poverty and the attempt to meet the basic needs of the people constituted overriding priorities for developing countries .  
While we recognized that the right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations , it was also recognized that meeting the environmental objectives in Agenda 21 would place additional , even onerous , burdens on developing countries .  
In most developing countries , the formal sector is incapable of providing a sufficient number of jobs to meet existing and future projected requirements .  
Their tenuous situation has frequently been exacerbated as special programmes to promote their participation in the labour force and as basic services and social safety nets have been weakened or dismantled in order to meet strict budgetary requirements .  
Statistics Canada 's globalization initiative was designed to meet that challenge , starting with the information required to understand how the various parts of a given firm fit together ; establish which of its parts are located in Canada ; deduce behaviour related to its condition ; and relate the firm 's performance to its new form of organization .  
In her special report on minorities ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 8 ) the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the former Yugoslavia expressed concern at the failure of the former Yugoslavia 's political leadership to meet the challenge of governing populations which do not share the nationality , ethnicity , religion or language of the different regions ' dominant national groups .  
In this sense , international cooperation , including financial and technical support , is a duty of States in the context of the HIV / AIDS epidemic and industrialized countries are encouraged to act in a spirit of solidarity in assisting developing countries to meet the challenges of implementing the Guidelines .  
The first one is that , by having established and implemented the largest compensation operation in history in record time and at minimum cost , the international community , acting through the United Nations , has confirmed the potential and capacity of the world organization to meet new and unprecedented challenges and to do it better than such operations performed outside its scope .

The current approach to energy policy worldwide , which is characterized by a strong emphasis on energy supply , without regard to its social , economic and environmental consequences , does not meet the requirements of sustainable development .  
According to a recent UNDP publication , 5 there are , today , good opportunities in remote rural areas of developing countries for using renewable sources of energy at competitive costs to meet the small-scale mechanical or electric power needs of the individual household , farm or village .  
We further call upon the international community and all its relevant institutions to meet their responsibility to halt these violations forthwith , to ensure the necessary protection for all missing persons , detainees and prisoners and to put an end to practices involving violence and threat of violence that have the basic purpose of spreading terror among the innocent civilian inhabitants of the area and uprooting them .  
Stresses that international cooperation and assistance are essential to supporting the efforts of developing countries , particularly African countries and the least developed countries , to meet the goal of eradicating poverty , and stresses at the same time that , at the request of Governments , the United Nations system should provide technical assistance in further developing and sustaining national capacities to gather and analyse information and to develop indicators for poverty analysis ;  
For retransmission of major national and international events and to meet a variety of needs , the ONPT also has an Earth mobile station which is used for occasional remote sensing and telephony , and which can operate with international and regional satellites .  
Noting that those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
The Senior Expert Group , which was also asked to ensure the active follow-up of the implementation of the 40 recommendations it had prepared , continued to meet and to examine various issues relating to international action against organized crime , including the question of the elaboration of a convention against organized transnational crime and the work that is being carried out by the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice with a view to increasing cooperation and coordinated action between the Group of Seven and the relevant United Nations entities .  
To improve coordination of public information activities , JUNIC decided to establish an open-ended working group based in New York to meet on a monthly or bi-monthly basis in the inter-sessional period and discuss matters of mutual concern , and also to revive the bi-monthly JUNIC Information Bulletin , prepared by the JUNIC secretariat and distributed electronically to the members of JUNIC and to directors of information of bilateral development agencies , as a means of keeping informed and better coordinating the preparation of information products and activities .  
Expresses its concern at the continuing violations of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran , in particular the high number of executions in the absence of internationally recognized safeguards , cases of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , the failure to meet international standards with regard to the administration of justice and the absence of due process of law , violations of the right to peaceful assembly and restrictions on the freedom of expression , thought , opinion and the press ;  
The process of urbanization facilitates sustainable development by giving more people access to productive and sustainable technologies and reducing pressure on ecologically fragile areas ; but it poses enormous problems for urban planning and management , which must meet the growing demand for energy , water and transportation , while coping with increasing volumes of solid , liquid and gaseous wastes .  
The Director , DAMR , is concerned that the authorized level of resources are not sufficient to meet his current audit and oversight responsibilities within acceptable professional standards of an average cycle of once every five to seven years .  
Other important factors in many regions include illegal logging ; illegal land occupation and illegal cultivation ; grazing pressures ; unsustainable agriculture ; the demand for fuelwood and charcoal to meet basic energy needs ; refugee-related problems ; mining and oil exploitation in forested countries not conducted in accordance with appropriate national legislation ; and natural climatic events and forest fires .  
At this meeting , the advance party informed the representatives that the Special Rapporteurs had found the clarifications and assurances contained in Note No . 57 / 97 unsatisfactory and that they would delay their arrival in Nigeria until they received assurances that they would be allowed to meet the detainees whose names had been transmitted to the Government in the note verbale from the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights dated 13 February 1997 .

Accordingly , it is proposed that the budget should include both an annual provision for the normal operational costs of the library and provision to meet the start-up costs of the library , that is , funds for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treatises , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate . 
An important activity , necessitated by the urgency with which accurate information is often requested at the United Nations / specialized agencies desk and the lack of comprehensive tools that would readily provide that information , is the creation of basic ready reference tools ( files , lists and the like ) to meet recurrent queries .  
As a result of this initiative by Ethiopia , leaders of 26 Somali political organizations were able to meet for a high-level consultation in Sodere , Ethiopia , and after eight weeks of intensive , frank and responsible negotiations , agreed on a common course of action to resolve the crisis in their country and to put an end to the misery and suffering of their people .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 3 June 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , giving details of the aerial violations that have accompanied the incursions into Iraq 's territory by the Turkish armed forces and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and to halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
The Commission shall meet annually , each session comprising a senior officials ' segment followed by a ministerial segment , for up to a maximum of seven working days to discuss and decide upon important issues concerning economic and social development in the region , to decide upon the recommendations of its subsidiary bodies and of the Executive Secretary , to examine and approve the programme of work and priorities and to take any other decisions required , in conformity with its terms of reference .  
Serve as a mobilizer of ideas and a catalyst for action to promote regional economic cooperation by identifying and addressing major development issues and regional concerns and priorities in trade , investment , financial , information technology , industrial and technological areas , and recommend policy options and measures to achieve tangible results and enhance national capacities to meet new challenges .  
The deliberations of the three committees confirmed once again how the parallel developments in cartographic and in information technology were rapidly bringing to users cost-effective applications in surveying , charting and mapping as a comprehensive set of the tools and effective approaches required to meet the challenge of sustainable development and the priorities of the countries in the region .  
The Civil Affairs Unit continues to coordinate with legal non-governmental organizations to resolve cases where the Government of Croatia does not issue documents according to the agreed procedures , including failure to meet administrative deadlines , refusals to issue passports to men of military age and refusals issued without the adequate explanation required by Croatian law .  
Recognizing that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential in achieving sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , and that North-South and South-South transfer of environmentally sound technologies is essential for sustainable development , and recognizing also that the fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their sustainable development requirements has not materialized ,  
Inability on the part of UNOPS to meet administrative costs or to respond to the financial consequences of extraordinary or unanticipated contingencies could result in claimant demands that alternative financing arrangements be placed before the Executive Board , including that responsibility be shared with or assumed by UNDP , the United Nations , or other UNOPS clients .  
This action has received increased support from different donor sources ; however , additional and increased development assistance is to be directed towards the basic social services with a view to improving primary and reproductive health care , basic education , skills development and literacy in priority , to at least meet the targets set by recent international conferences . 
The Joint Border Commission continues to meet on a regular basis and to focus on resolving the disputed border areas it had previously identified , but the results of its work have thus far fallen short of the expectations and the public statements of intent of the two parties in this regard .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 21 August 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , calling attention to the fact that Turkish military operations in northern Iraq are continuing to violate Iraq 's sovereignty and territorial integrity and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
In approving the new distribution plan , I have informed the Government that the United Nations accepts the Government 's assurances as a commitment that the necessary additional resources will be available for vulnerable groups in central and southern Iraq . I have also informed the Government that the United Nations will continue to observe the situation of such groups in the context of my responsibilities under resolutions 986 ( 1995 ) and 1111 ( 1997 ) to determine and report on the adequacy of resources to meet the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi population .  
In this connection , the Secretary-General wishes to draw the attention of the General Committee to a letter dated 11 September 1997 ( A / 52 / 340 ) in which the Chairman of the Committee on Conferences informed the President of the General Assembly that the Committee had recommended , on the strict understanding that meetings would have to be accommodated within available facilities and services , that the following subsidiary organs should be authorized to meet during the main part of the fifty-second session : ( a ) Committee for Programme and Coordination ;  
Following the rapid and massive return of refugees in late 1996 and early 1997 , UNICEF focused on quickly expanding essential services in Rwanda , such as health , nutrition , education and social services , to meet the urgent needs of returning children . 
Also invites States to develop comprehensive strategies at the national , regional and local levels to meet the increase in demand for care and support for older persons as individuals , within their families and communities , and within institutions , bearing in mind the changing socio-economic , technological and cultural environment ;  
I am pleased to announce my own plans to visit the continent before the end of the year , to meet with leaders and people there and to make as real as I can America 's commitment to stand with Africans as they realize long-delayed aspirations for true freedom , growing prosperity and simple human dignity .  
The Commission also decided to retain the special bodies for least developed , landlocked and island developing countries , which would continue to meet biennially for a maximum of two days immediately prior to the annual session of the Commission .  
We again stress the need to increase resources from bilateral and multilateral sources to finance alternative development programmes and projects , including in them the social and economic aspects of drug trafficking , in order to meet the needs of the communities involved in the growing of illicit crops .  
In the 115 municipalities covered by the National Reconstruction Plan which were identified as having been most seriously affected by the conflict , social and production programmes designed to help meet the economic and social needs of poor communities were carried out ; these communities benefited from initiatives for agricultural development , social infrastructure , training and technical assistance , credit , establishment of micro-enterprises , social development and environmental management .  
China is in favour of imposing strict and feasible restrictions on anti-personnel landmines and their use , with a view to achieving the objective of an ultimate ban in a step-by-step manner .  In order to meet its legitimate defence requirements , China can not but reserve its legitimate right to use anti-personnel landmines on its own territories before alternative means are found and defensive capabilities established .  
Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-servicing obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
It can be achieved only through a multidimensional and integrated approach that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities and public services , enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
The Global Environment Facility , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the Facility instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
To meet this objective , this Advisory Committee of the Secretary-General has encouraged all countries to ensure ready access to global , regional , national and local warning systems as part of their national development plans by the year 2000 .  
The Union 's institutional capacity , as indicated by the evaluation report , needs to be further enhanced , particularly for reaching ethnic minorities , through ( a ) the adaptation of communication materials to meet their needs ; ( b ) a decentralized process for developing materials ; and ( c ) upgrading members ' skills in interactive and participatory communication .  
Bearing in mind the close interrelationship between ensuring peace and achieving national reconciliation in Tajikistan and the ability of the country to meet the humanitarian needs of its people and to take effective steps towards the rapid revitalization of the economy , and reaffirming the urgent need to assist Tajikistan in its efforts to restore basic services and the infrastructure of the country ,  
The European Union expressed the hope that in 1997 sufficient contributions would be announced to meet all the needs provided for in the budget for 1998 , and urged all other States , especially the rich States of the region , to increase the size of their contributions in the light of the Agencys growing needs .  
According to reliable sources available to the Commission , the exiled Rwandan political and military elite located in Nairobi have formed an " invasion group " to plan for the invasion of Rwanda in pincer-movement attacks from the east and the west - the camps in Zaire and United Republic of Tanzania - which would " meet in Kigali " to conquer the country and restore Hutu rule .  
In its deliberations , the Commission noted the interest that various forms of private participation in public infrastructure projects had raised in many States , in particular in developing countries , as the successful implementation of such projects would enable States to achieve significant savings in public expenditure and to reallocate the resources that otherwise would have been invested in infrastructure in order to meet more pressing social needs .  
Modalities for cooperation between the public and private sectors are being developed and the construction industry is reorganizing itself to meet the changing demands of large and complex redevelopment projects , involving mixed uses and integrated infrastructure and finance mechanisms . 
Ultimately , an Organization reformed along these lines and better able to meet global challenges will have to strengthen its ties with and complement regional organizations , not only in the political field but also at the social and economic level .  
There is absolutely no doubt that increased international assistance and initiatives for debt relief or cancellation , increased official development assistance to meet agreed targets , private capital flows , increased foreign direct investment , and improved terms of trade would play a catalytic role in Africa 's efforts to achieve economic development .  
When we speak of reform in the United Nations , we have in mind first and foremost an effective distribution of United Nations resources , the streamlining of the Organization 's administrative and organizational structures , and budgetary and structural reform of the United Nations Secretariat , as well as personnel adjustments to meet the challenges of the modern world .  
The United Nations , as a special and irreplaceable place for 185 States to meet , work together and cooperate , must lay down rules of law recognized universally by all so that international relations can continue in a coherent , equitable and efficient manner .  
We feel that the United Nations system should be made stronger , more effective and more efficient in order to meet the priorities set by all its Members not just the priorities of the economically strong and the militarily powerful but , especially , the priorities of the weak and vulnerable States , which should be prevented from becoming outsiders in the global economy .  
This will enable the Organization to meet the daunting challenges of economic development faced by our global community and those posed by the political and ideological differences afflicting nations today .  
We are seeking to build a modern society capable of accompanying the world on its march forward and of assimilating scientific and technological information ; a society aware of the challenges of our time and working to meet those challenges .  
It is the aim of the Jamaican Government to develop adequate employment opportunities , matched by improvements in the skills and literacy of our human resources , recognizing that an effectively trained , adaptable and flexible work force is critical if we are to meet the demands of the economy .  
In conclusion , my delegation pledges its support to you , Mr . President , including in your capacity as Chairman of the Open-ended Working Group , to take our work forward in a practical and constructive manner towards an outcome which will result in an expanded , more representative , more transparent Security Council , better equipped to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century .  
For most developing countries , continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet the needs for investment capital , foreign exchange , and human development priorities .  
When resources of the central government are insufficient to meet the needs for public services and infrastructure , local authorities and non-governmental organizations can play an important role in raising resources , providing services , strengthening rural / urban linkages , stimulating private investment , and implementing national policies .  
Continued and expanded international financial resources are required to meet those needs , to support structural adjustment , and to enable the least developed countries and other low-income countries to benefit from globalization and to generate sustained growth .  
Developed countries , in the mutual interests of donors and recipients , must sustain existing levels of bilateral and multilateral ODA and other official finance to developing countries and improve their quality in order to better meet the growing demand for modern economic infrastructure , health and education , environmental protection and policy reforms .  
For such standards to be effective , they will need to meet three basic standards of their own : they must be " floors " , rather than " ceilings " - that is , they must block downward but not upward movement ; they must be set high enough to make a real impact , rather than at a least-common-denominator level ; and they must be developed through an open and inclusive process that will build a strong consensus for them .  
In this regard , the Habitat Agenda contains numerous suggestions for action , such as ensuring legal protection from discrimination in access to shelter and basic services ; helping the family in its supporting , educating and nurturing roles ; and encouraging social and economic policies that are designed to meet the housing needs of families and their individual members .  
The main obstacles are the lack of effective legislation for the monitoring and control of pollution and the absence of effective cost-recovery systems at the local or national level to meet the costs of treatment , protection of water sources , cleaning up polluted water and other essential measures .  
The challenge today remains the same : to meet an enormous projected global demand for resources , especially energy , through the use of new products , technologies and consumption patterns which will provide rising standards of living for all while minimizing economic costs and risks to human health and the environment .  
There is a growing need to integrate urban needs with those of the surrounding rural , or once rural areas ; to assess changes in the peri-urban areas in response to rapid urbanization ; to prepare strategies to meet the concentrated demands for food , energy and various material goods ; to ensure that urban development proceeds in an environmentally sound manner ; and to involve all stakeholders in urban development projects .  
Decides that the preparatory process for the special session of the General Assembly should be funded through the regular budget of the United Nations , bearing in mind the need to keep financial costs to a minimum , and that Governments should be invited to make extrabudgetary contributions to meet those costs ;  
Also in its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission reaffirmed the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States by undertaking advisory services and training programmes ; by carrying out field studies at the regional , subregional , national and local levels , also drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions ; by developing comprehensive strategic plans for technical cooperation ; and by preparing model assistance projects .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 51 / 63 , reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and stressed the need to continue to improve the operational activities of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States , at their request , for support in crime prevention and criminal justice .  
It is expected that about two thirds of the increases in agricultural production required to meet projected increases in effective demand will come as a result of improved yields from land currently under cultivation in developing countries , much of which is irrigated .  
The continued existence of the problem of internal displacement combined with the ongoing need to search for solutions require that the capacity of the Representatives mandate and of the United Nations human rights machinery in general be strengthened in order to meet these challenges in a comprehensive and effective manner .  
In addition to being flexible , any new system of desirable ranges should meet a number of operational requirements ; such a system , inter alia , should produce predictable and verifiable results , be easy to administer and be transparent .  
The overall humanitarian situation in Tajikistan has remained critical .  A dramatic deterioration of the social and industrial infrastructure and a decline in the provision of social , health and education services , the lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes , and a sharp drop in the real income of most families have combined to render large sectors of the population in Tajikistan unable to meet even their basic food needs .  
The safety of space NPS at all stages of their operation and in the event of foreseeable accidents will be ensured by safety systems and NPS structural elements designed to meet safety requirements , and by special comprehensive administrative and technical measures to prevent accidents and eliminate the effects of accidents .  
It has been increasingly recognized that positive measures are important and can be indispensable elements to assist developing countries to meet the multilaterally agreed targets of an MEA , in keeping with the principle of common but differentiated responsibility .  
As far as global problems are concerned , there is a considerable potential for generating win-win scenarios if foreign investors also transfer best environmental practices and technologies in order to enable developing countries to meet their commitments under MEAs . 
According to the Secretary-General 's interim report , this will be achieved in two ways : in the 15 governorates of central and southern Iraq , the Government will distribute the goods according to its current food rationing system , but will be observed to ensure the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies and . . . the adequacy of revenues to meet Iraq 's humanitarian needs ( para . 26 ) ; while in the three northern governorates distribution will be by the United Nations according to current modalities and existing resources ( para .  20 ) .  
To meet the rapidly evolving tasks of the Programme , a new approach to its financing is required which , in the view of the High Commissioner , must be based on increased funds from the regular budget , expanded partnerships with United Nations agencies and programmes , including UNDP and the World Bank , NGOs and academic institutions , and on a greater contribution by Governments interested in receiving technical assistance .  
That delegation also expressed the view that the safety of those spacecraft at all stages of their operation and in the event of foreseeable accidents would be ensured by safety systems and nuclear power source structural elements designed to meet safety requirements and by special comprehensive administrative and technical measures to prevent accidents and eliminate the effects of accidents .  
With regard to project activities , the Committee was informed that a reserve is maintained for each project in accordance with United Nations administrative instructions ( ST / AI / 285 ) for technical cooperation trust funds , which stipulates in Part IV , B , that " a cash reserve at the level of 15 per cent of the annual estimated expenditures " is to be maintained during the implementation of the trust fund activities to cover eventual shortfalls and will be utilized to meet the final expenditure of the trust fund , including liquidating liabilities .  
Also invites States to develop comprehensive strategies at the national , regional and local level to meet the increase in demand for care and support for older persons as individuals , within their families and communities , as well as in institutions , bearing in mind the changing socio-economic , technological and cultural environment ;  
Sharp reductions in the level of assistance for social welfare , health care and education ; insufficient energy supplies for hospitals , schools and residences ; and reduced real income for most families have hindered the ability of Tajikistan 's population to meet its most basic human needs .  
Although increased private flows have led to investments in industry and technology in some developing countries and economies in transition , many other developing countries have been left behind , slowing the process of technological change in those countries and limiting their ability to meet their commitments under Agenda 21 and other international agreements .  
Donor Governments should strive to meet the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for overall official development assistance as soon as possible ; and interested developed and developing country partners , having agreed on a mutual commitment to allocate , on average , 20 per cent of official development assistance and 20 per cent of the national budget to basic social programmes , should take into account a gender perspective .  
Notes with appreciation the strengthened training programmes , inter alia , people management training , upgrading of substantive skills , information technology , communications and training in all six official languages on an equal basis , and requests the Secretary-General to continue to invest in the Organization 's future capacity by sustaining and expanding these programmes in order to meet organizational needs and individual career development aspirations ;  
Decides to establish a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts , appointed on the basis of equitable geographical representation after consultations with the regional groups , to meet for a period of 10 working days prior to the fifty _ fourth session of the Commission , with a mandate to : 
Notes with appreciation the strengthened training programmes , inter alia , people management training , upgrading of substantive skills , information technology , communications and training in all six official languages on an equal basis , and requests the Secretary-General to continue to invest in the Organization 's future capacity by sustaining and expanding these programmes in order to meet organizational needs and individual career development aspirations ;  
While the Committee appreciates the need to upgrade the system , especially in the aftermath of the damage to existing facilities resulting from a fire at UNFICYP headquarters , the Committee believes that the system should be at a level sufficient to meet the operational needs of the mission and that the introduction of " stand-alone " or highly specialized , sophisticated and expensive equipment , entailing additional training and staff resources , as indicated in paragraph 11 of the same annex , should be avoided or kept to a minimum . 
Canada noted that the outline was very comprehensive , but that a manual that concentrated on basic issues would be better suited to meet the needs of both developed and developing countries .  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Therefore , the members of such groups should either be covered by the conditions applicable to popular armed resistance groups , thereby subjecting them to the provisions and obligations of international humanitarian law to a certain extent , or should be regarded as groups that fail to meet the international requirements for classification as legal combatants , either as members of a regular army or a legitimate resistance movement , in which case , being totally beyond the pale of the law , there would be no point in placing them under any obligation . 
The indicators meet certain essential criteria : they are considered to be ethical , useful , scientifically robust , representative , understandable and accessible .  
The United Nations Industrial Development Organization ( UNIDO ) has implemented HIV / AIDS prevention projects in sub-Saharan Africa , to meet the combined objectives of industrial development and the prevention of the spread of HIV / AIDS . UNIDO is supporting improved access to and affordability of products used in prevention programmes condoms , latex gloves , syringes , HIV-1 / 2 test kits through development of local manufacturing capability . 
The technological advances that were often readily available to potential terrorists called for a higher degree of political cooperation , and new challenges would undoubtedly emerge that would require innovative legal approaches and techniques to meet them , and joint efforts with other international and regional bodies . 
His Government ( a democratically elected one , as the international and regional organizations that had supervised the electoral process had duly reported ) had enacted just such domestic legislation , and had met , and would continue to meet , its corresponding international obligations .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Notes with concern that in the current biennium the budgetary resources for technical cooperation in the field of human rights have decreased by half as compared with the previous biennium , and requests the Secretary _ General to allocate to the human rights programme , in the context of the budgetary planning for the biennium 1998 _ 1999 , more human and financial resources for the enlargement of the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation in the field of human rights in order to meet the substantially increased demand ;  
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
A number of delegations expressed their concerns in regard to the serious financial situation of the Centre , with many noting that the financial resources available to the Centre were inadequate and that the Centre required enhanced financial as well as human resources if it were to meet its challenges at the global , regional , national and local levels .  
Deeply concerned at the impact of the conflict on the humanitarian situation and on the social and economic infrastructure of Tajikistan , and aware that the sharp decline in the provision of social , health and education services , lack of heating fuel for hospitals , schools and homes and the sharp drop in the real income of most families have made it increasingly difficult for large sections of the population in Tajikistan to meet their basic needs ,  
Other objectives include the provision of timely and authoritative information by the Spokesman for the Secretary-General to media representatives , the provision of timely and adaptable information materials through the United Nations information centres to meet regional and local needs , the establishment of an international broadcasting system and monitoring of international trends and events as reflected in the media , as well as coverage of the Organization and the Secretary-General by major media networks .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 26 May 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , giving details of the aerial violations that have accompanied the fresh incursions into Iraq 's territory by the Turkish armed forces and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and to halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
In the mid-1990s , private flows have been exceeding official sources : ODA has shrunk to an all time low of 0.27 per cent of GNP , and a growing portion is going to meet humanitarian needs ( rising from US $ 1-billion in 1990 to US $ 3-billion in 1993 , peaking in 1994 ) and debt relief .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 31 May 1997 addressed to you by Mr .

Those developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints .  
It can only be achieved through a multidimensional and integrated approach , that combines programmes targeted at people living in poverty with policies and strategies that meet the basic needs of all , strengthen their productive capacities , empower them to participate in decision-making on policies that affect them , ensure access of all to productive resources , opportunities , public services , and enhance social protection and reduce vulnerability .  
The Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) , whose additional grant and concessional funding is designed to achieve global environmental benefits , should meet the agreed incremental costs of relevant activities under Agenda 21 , in accordance with the GEF instrument , in particular for developing countries .  
On instructions from my Government , I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a letter dated 12 June 1997 addressed to you by Mr . Mohammed Said Al-Sahaf , Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iraq , giving details of the aerial violations that have accompanied the continuing incursion into Iraq 's territory by the Turkish armed forces and urging the United Nations to meet its responsibilities as laid down in the Charter and to halt the intimidation and aggression to which Iraq is constantly being subjected .  
Although the distributional impact of harmonized national carbon taxes may be uneven , it could be complemented by allocating the revenue to a trust fund to be used to finance projects for those countries which are overburdened with carbon taxes . 29 The rates should be chosen to meet the carbon emission abatement objective and should be periodically adjusted as more is learned about global warming .  
Referring to Recommendation No .  3 of the Committee 's eighth session , in which the Committee invited the Director-General to examine the possibility of establishing an international fund intended to facilitate the restitution of stolen or illicitly exported cultural objects in cases where the countries concerned are unable to meet the related financial costs ,  
The inventory of financial needs and the data base of financial sources would have the following characteristics in order to ensure their effective use : ( i ) available to participants in the CCD consultative processes ; ( ii ) disseminated through various channels , including the Internet ; ( iii ) packaged to meet the needs of customers ; and ( iv ) frequently updated .  27 .  Inventory of financial requirements .  
Unfortunately and I repeat , unfortunately the persistent reluctance of the countries of the North to respect their commitments to the developing countries by granting additional financial resources , increasing public development aid to 0.7 per cent of their gross national product and transferring eco-technologies under favourable conditions , is considerably restricting the capacity of these countries to meet the requirements of sustainable development . 
The Fund has maintained a solid financial standing and has been utilized by operational organizations of the United Nations system on 48 occasions to meet urgent relief requirements .  
In resolution 1997 / 15 , the Commission decided to establish a working group consisting of five intergovernmental experts to meet prior to the fifty-fourth session of the Commission with a mandate to : ( a ) gather all relevant information from Governments , non-governmental organizations and any other relevant sources on the obstacles existing to the effective and full protection of the human rights of migrants ; and ( b ) elaborate recommendations to strengthen the promotion , protection and implementation of the human rights of migrants .  
Recognizing also that global partnership and international cooperation for development are essential for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development , particularly through the creation of a more favourable international economic environment , transfer of environmentally sound technologies to developing countries on concessional and preferential terms , and fulfilment of the commitment to transfer to developing countries substantial new and additional financial resources to meet their huge sustainable development requirements ,  
Strongly urge the industrialized countries to provide predictable , adequate , new and additional financial resources to meet their commitments under and the requirements of Agenda 21 and to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent gross national product ( GNP ) as official development assistance immediately , and also to ensure that within that target 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of GNP is earmarked for least developed countries ;  
As established in Agenda 21 , the global partnership for sustainable development must be based on the transfer of new and additional resources to developing countries to meet their immense needs and enable them to achieve sustainable development .  
Furthermore , irrational phenomena still existed in the world economic system which were hampering the development efforts of developing countries , including the stagnation of international cooperation in such areas as finance , debt , trade and the transfer of technology ; the protectionism still practised by some of the major developed countries in international trade and economic activities ; and the emphasis placed by those countries on the role of private capital and market mechanisms , while minimizing the responsibility of their Governments to meet their commitments with regard to official development assistance .  
The assembled leaders renewed their commitment to ensure that all people , at all times , have physical and economic access to sufficient , safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life .  
A network of educational facilities providing education and training in space science and technology at the postgraduate level should be developed to meet the increasing need in the region for adequately educated and trained human resources .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Although humanitarian agencies have continued to transport modest quantities of medical and other non-food supplies across the Guinean border , those operations have been insufficient to meet the growing needs of a collapsing primary health care system .  
Pursuant to various legislative mandates , the United Nations Programme in Public Administration and Finance has sought to meet the expressed needs of developing countries in improving their administrative and financial management systems for development .  
To them the end of the cold war simply dictated changes in the positioning of strategic and tactical nuclear weapons and the taking of steps to develop new nuclear-weapon systems to meet the geopolitical requirements of the new international system .  
The expansion of demand from the public sector is hindered by budgetary constraints : insufficient public funds are available to meet the needs for environmental infrastructure building / upgrading and clean _ up in developed and developing countries .  
The growing space industry and the many associated service and scientific organizations require a steady flow of enthusiastic , trained and competent young engineers and scientists to meet the challenges of the future .  
In today \ x { e5b8 } global marketplace , where the supply is produced in one location to meet a demand elsewhere and in which profits from such illegal transactions can be hidden in numerous jurisdictions , enhanced international cooperation is key .  
The Committee decided that in the future it would meet in private half an hour before starting consideration of a country report , in order to pinpoint the main problems to be addressed during public discussion .  
Noting the importance of adherence to internationally accepted norms and principles as well as the need to promote , as required , national and international legislation to meet actual and potential humanitarian challenges ,  
A critical element is the availability of public resources to finance and support publicly provided services and to stimulate and complement private and voluntary provision , as appropriate , and their more effective and efficient use to meet stated objectives .  
The Government 's social security policy is to meet the basic and special needs of the disadvantaged , including the financially vulnerable , the elderly and the severely disabled .  
Noting the importance of adherence to internationally accepted norms and principles and the need to promote , as required , national and international legislation to meet actual and potential humanitarian challenges ,  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
In conclusion , he said that he wished to reiterate that UNEP needed a solid financial base in order to discharge its strengthened mandate and meet the growing environmental challenges worldwide .  
It was convinced that the adoption of appropriate economic policies and the committed participation of the industrialized countries and international financial institutions would make it possible to meet the challenges of sustainable development .  
One of the major objectives of the camp was to upgrade trainers skills in adapting existing training materials and designing new ones to meet the needs of various target groups in urban and rural areas , with emphasis on the poor .  
Debtor countries derived two benefits from those operations : released collateral can be used to meet other obligations , and since the swap is effected at a discount based on secondary market prices debt outstanding is commensurately reduced .  
It should be designed to meet critical urgent needs , as well as the long-term requirements essential for the development of a sustainable national / local capacity , when applicable .  
Noting that the developing countries that have continued , at great cost to themselves , to meet their international debt and debt-service obligations in a timely fashion have done so despite serious external and domestic financial constraints ,  
Information received from a number of regional institutions indicate , however , that they are still unable to meet the technical assistance needs of small island developing States in their respective regions on account of a number of constraints , which are briefly outlined in section III below .  
Such a situation would create additional pressure on developing countries , including small island developing States , to meet their growing domestic demand for fish as food on the one hand a problem likely to be aggravated by declining productivity of coastal fisheries due to coral reef degradation , as previously discussed and to increase their share of international markets on the other .  
Noting the importance of adherence to internationally accepted norms and principles and the need to promote , as required , national and international legislation to meet actual and potential humanitarian challenges ,  
In many respects , those conditions did not meet contemporary international standards in the field of human rights or the requirements of the Fourth Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949 , which the General Assembly had determined was applicable to the occupied territories . 
IFF may wish to consider the success of CGIAR in mobilizing resources and achieving coherence for international efforts to address a shared global agenda in the field of agriculture and food security and to examine the potential of extending that model to address forest research to ensure sustainable forest management and to maintain adequate cover of all types of forest and other wooded lands to meet a variety of current and future human needs .  
A view was expressed that the 1998 split session had been a success since the Commission had completed both the set of 17 draft articles on prevention of transboundary damage from hazardous activities and the draft guidelines on reservations to treaties and had offered the possibility to legal advisers of permanent missions at New York to observe the work of the Commission and to meet its members .  
Thus , while at a global level it is reasonable to be confident that wood supplies are adequate to meet future requirements , the supply situation is often much less clear in regional , national or local contexts .  
Local , national and international policies must reflect an accurate understanding of the factors affecting demands on forests , and must reflect consistent , mutually supportive approaches to ensuring that efforts to meet these demands are consistent with sustainable forest management .  
My Governments pattern of payments clearly reflects its unshakable determination to meet its budgetary obligations despite the extraordinary difficulties it is facing as a result of the rigid , irrational and inhuman economic , commercial and financial blockade imposed by the United States of America on Cuba for more than three long decades .  
The executive boards had accomplished a great deal in the area of funding strategies , but much remained to be done in order to ensure predictable , assured funding of activities within the United Nations mandate and of efforts to achieve the ambitious goals set at United Nations conferences and to meet the needs of developing countries .  
To strengthen and reorient health education and health services , in particular primary health-care programmes , including in sexual and reproductive health , and to design quality health programmes that meet the physical and mental needs of girls and attend to the needs of young expectant and nursing mothers ;  
Among the general factors are significant technological innovations ; high indebtedness and stringent budget constraints limiting the public sectors ability to meet increasing infrastructure needs ; the expansion of international and local capital markets , with a consequent improvement in access to private funding ; and an increasing number of successful international experiences with private participation and competition in infrastructure .  
In its decision 1998 / 102 , the Commission requested the independent expert to submit his report as envisioned in decision 1997 / 103 for consideration by the open-ended working group on structural adjustment programmes and economic , social and cultural rights , which is scheduled to meet from 1 to 5 March 1999 . 
It also involves a form of socio _ economic and political restructuring which will remove the locus of power from the current custodians of State power , enable disadvantaged men and women to meet their basic needs and to fully participate in decision-making , and provide opportunities to challenge internal and external exploiters .  
Calls upon States to consider additional voluntary contributions to meet the pressing human rights and humanitarian needs in the area , and underlines the need for continuing coordination among States , international organizations and non-governmental organizations of initiatives and programmes with the aim of avoiding duplication , overlap and working at cross-purposes ;  
In some legal systems , an entity operating under a governmental concession to provide certain essential services ( e.g . electricity or potable water ) to a community or territory and its inhabitants is held to assume an obligation to provide a service system that is reasonably adequate to meet the demand of the community or territory .  
President Kabbah 's decision to allow the leader of RUF , Corporal Foday Sankoh , to meet with rebel leaders in order to develop a coherent set of political demands , which would form the basis of subsequent negotiations with the Government , is a bold and valuable initiative .  
The ultimate objective is to develop an international agenda for action on forests which is holistic , integrated and comprehensive , in accordance with United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) objectives , so as to maintain forests and other wooded lands in a healthy and productive state to meet the diverse needs of current and future generations and address other issues of global significance .  
Since the informal economy which harbours a significant proportion of irregular migrants operates largely at the periphery or outside the national protection system , States should be encouraged to extend the basic human rights standards to this sector and to enforce them , and to assist enterprises to improve their economic capacity , thereby enabling them to meet these standards .  
The Seventh Meeting of States Parties in 1997 approved in principle the ongoing need during the first five years to appropriate a sum of $ 60,000 per year to meet the operational costs and $ 60,000 per year for the " start-up costs " of the library , i.e . , resources for the acquisition of basic reference material , including major treaties , official documents and important journals and periodicals , with back copies , as appropriate .  
It would require the support of the international community in order , inter alia to promote full employment as a basic priority of economic and social policies and to encourage the formulation of policies and strategies , at the national and regional level , that would meet the basic needs of the people , strengthen their productive capacities and empower them to participate in decision-making .  
At the same meeting , I reminded the Foreign Minister that the Group of Experts had carefully considered the feasibility of a national tribunal , but concluded that the Cambodian judiciary in its current state was unlikely to meet minimal international standards of justice , even with external assistance .  
In late 1998 , for instance , he stated , " An international tribunal would have the perfect right to take up the case of genocide in Cambodia because it concerns crimes against humanity and that concerns the conscience of the world community " . 59 And , although the Group was also unable to meet with the leader of the parliamentary opposition , Sam Rainsy , who was outside Cambodia at the time of our visit , he too has publicly expressed support for a trial of Khmer Rouge leaders on many occasions . 
It should also be emphasized that another of its objectives was to forestall the financial crisis facing the existing social security institutions in the medium term , and thereby ensure that their income would be sufficient to meet their obligations to pensioners and their administrative costs .  
On the contrary , it has always been considered a very sound way of providing guarantees to Salvadoran workers taking up offers of work abroad that are fraudulent or do not meet the conditions laid down in national legislation .  
imperative to maintain and enhance humanitarian assistance not only to meet basic human needs and thus to uphold the right to life of millions of suffering Afghans , but also to provide incentives for ending or significantly relaxing the existing restrictions which were violative of human rights . 
These developments present an opportunity to adopt a bold and imaginative strategy which would enable the international community to meet the urgent humanitarian needs of the people of Afghanistan while firmly adhering to the commitment to establish a framework for durable peace based on a realization of the human rights of all Afghans .  
His delegation was convinced that the final text must meet at least two conditions : it must result in a consistent and well _ organized instrument , which did not duplicate existing international instruments or those under discussion in other forums ; it must be effective , which meant that it must enable States to act effectively against the scourges with which the protocol dealt .  
At a time when the entire world is mobilized to create great and viable economic and political groupings to meet the challenges of globalization , Africa should not get bogged down in wars that dismember States that are already greatly fragmented as a result of the politically expedient borders we inherited through colonial laws .  
It recognized , however , the need to extend sympathetic understanding to Member States temporarily unable to meet their financial obligations owing to genuine economic difficulties .  
However , in order to effectively and efficiently meet the heavy and varied demands of the United Nations for legal services provided under this subprogramme , which requires a range of expertise , all attorneys of the Division , whether funded from the regular budget of the United Nations , from peacekeeping assessments or from resources provided by the separately funded , subsidiary organs , are treated as an integral part of the Division .

New initiatives to meet the challenge of the informal sector could focus on increasing productivity through access to credit , basic infrastructure and social services , on a regulatory environment which is conducive to improving the quality of work without stifling the informal sectors employment creating capacity and on organizing informal sector employers and workers to defend their own interests .  
As indicated in the Secretary-Generals report on human resources management ( A / 53 / 342 ) , the purpose of career development is to build and maintain a highly competent , multi-skilled and versatile international civil service capable of meeting the Organizations present and future needs and , in so doing , to meet the development needs and career aspirations of individual staff members .  
Similarly , new safety and environmental standards require the renovation of existing buildings to meet modern standards in such areas as fire safety , access for the disabled , interior air quality , asbestos abatement and safe handling of dangerous or toxic materials .  
Special development situations require an integrated approach to security and development , one that entails programmes set in a time-frame larger than three years and that has as an integral part , from the outset of the peace-building process , social and community development programmes designed to meet the basic needs of the population .  
Considers intolerable that more than 800-million people , especially women and children , throughout the world , and particularly in developing countries , do not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs , which infringes their fundamental human rights and at the same time can generate additional pressures upon the environment in ecologically weak areas ;  
Several participants emphasized that criteria used in certification schemes should meet or exceed minimum national standards , where they exist , and should include social , cultural and economic aspects as well as environmental considerations .  
To develop environmentally , socially and culturally compatible forms of tourism and to continue the development and implementation of voluntary initiatives in support of sustainable tourism development , bearing in mind that such forms of tourism and initiatives should meet , or preferably exceed , relevant local , national , regional or international standards ;

Improved coordination among the national and international institutions charged with developing and encouraging the adoption of policies and measures to meet human needs , without undermining the environmental foundation for development ;  
At its fifty _ fifth session , the Commission on Human Rights , in its resolution 1999 / 53 , decided that the Sub _ Commission should further review , in the light of the ongoing discussions by the Commission on its working methods , the establishment of a forum on economic , social and cultural rights , to be called the Social Forum , to meet during its annual sessions with the following objectives :  
The Governments assembled in Rome declared that they considered it intolerable and unacceptable that more than 800-million people throughout the world , particularly in developing countries , did not have enough food to meet their basic nutritional needs .

Nevertheless the Mission should have properly documented the conditions surrounding the acceptance of a fleet of buses that fulfilled the operational requirement but that did not meet the original technical specification , albeit to a much lesser extent than originally reported .  
Although we fully acknowledge the importance of reproductive health programmes , their implementation still requires enormous financial and technical assistance by the international community to complement the efforts made in this regard by developing countries , and the least developed in particular , since they can not meet these demands .  
Adequate and sufficient international support should be extended to meet the basic needs of refugee populations , including the provision of access to adequate accommodation , education , protection from violence , health services including reproductive health and family planning , and other basic social services , including clean water , sanitation , and nutrition .

The sheer magnitude of the post-Cold War problems , the levels of national and regional insecurity they generate and State reluctance to continue to meet what are seen as the rising financial , political , environmental and social costs of maintaining large refugee populations , or receiving a continuous flow has had a marked and negative impact on the willingness of countries to provide asylum .  
The principal United Nations humanitarian agencies UNHCR , the World Food Programme ( WFP ) , UNICEF and the World Health Organization ( WHO ) as well as the International Organization for Migration ( IOM ) , ICRC and the International Federation of the Red Cross ( IFRC ) have established representative offices at Pristina and are operating in all regions .

While the transparency commitments made under the SPS Agreement had improved the flow of information on SPS-related regulations of WTO member countries , an application of country-specific SPS requirements beyond what was recommended as an international standard saddled developing country producers and exporters with additional costs to meet disparate SPS measures on the same product in different markets .  
As experienced by some developing countries , the calculated product-specific AMS of a market price support measure could become a negative figure when the administered market price dropped below the ERP nominally fixed to the world price in the 1986-1988 base period to meet the objective of supporting food purchases by poor households .

Ways should be found to enable developing countries to participate more effectively in the formulation of international standards , a very costly process , and gain access to mutual recognition agreements concluded progressively among developed countries ( and which discriminate against developing countries ) , as well as to meet sanitary and phytosanitary regulations .  
GOOS aims to meet the need for : ( a ) forecasting climate variability and change ; ( b ) assessing the state of health of the marine environment and its resources ( including the coastal zone ) ; and ( c ) supporting an improved decision-making and management process which takes into account potential natural and man-made changes in the environment and their effects on human health and resources .
