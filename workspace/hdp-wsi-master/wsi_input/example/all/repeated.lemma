On 1 August 1996 , notwithstanding the repeated complaints by the Permanent Mission of Cuba to the United Nations and the many requests made to the authorities of the host country by citizens living in the vicinity of the Mission and by organizations representing various groups within American society to remove these provocative and offensive signs , the sign located on the north-east corner , inside the security area of the Permanent Mission of Cuba , was not taken down but simply moved to the north-west corner of the same intersection .  
On instructions from my Government , and further to our earlier letters concerning Israel 's repeated attacks on southern Lebanon and the western Bekaa and the arbitrary practices against the local inhabitants in which Israel engages on a daily basis , I have the honour to notify you of the series of such incidents that took place during the second half of July and in August 1996 .  
The Committee wishes to remind the international community that these tragic developments follow repeated warnings about the devastating consequences for Palestinian hopes and living conditions , of the delayed implementation by Israel of the agreements already reached , its prolonged closure of the occupied Palestinian territory , including Jerusalem , the resumption of land confiscation and settlement , and actions against Palestinian property and institutions in Jerusalem .  
The General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights , in their repeated resolutions , have recognized the enhanced functioning of the operational presence of the Centre for Human Rights in Cambodia and have requested the Secretary-General to ensure adequate resources from within existing United Nations resources .  
In that part of the former Yugoslavia , the ethnic Albanians , who constituted the overwhelming majority continued to be subjected to Serbian police and military repression and to large-scale violations of their human rights despite repeated condemnations of that situation in the relevant General Assembly resolutions .  
Although the Department of Peacekeeping Operations had established a number of bodies to increase its effectiveness , acquired considerable experience in that area and carried out many studies , Mozambique was concerned to see that the Organization remained slow to respond to conflict situations and that it repeated errors which had been committed in past operations .  Cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations must be improved .  
As I left the region , attention was already shifting from the humanitarian crisis to the political situation in Zaire and its potentially turbulent effects on an already fragile and volatile region ; hence the repeated calls by all the African leaders for the absolute need to safeguard the territorial integrity of Zaire . 
Japan , which experienced the calamity of atomic bombing , fervently desires that the use of nuclear weapons , which cause incomparable human suffering , should never be repeated and firmly believes that continuous efforts should be made towards creating a world free of nuclear weapons .  
The Special Rapporteur thus deeply regrets the fact that the States which had formed the nucleus of this multinational force were forced to break off their concerted efforts , after spending weeks setting up a base at Entebbe ( Uganda ) , owing to the lack of sufficient political support from the international community and to Rwanda 's repeated opposition to the undertaking .  
To condemn Israel in the strongest terms for its persistence in making repeated attacks on Lebanese territory ; and to appeal to the international community , international organizations and their member States to bring pressure to bear on Israel to pay compensation to Lebanon for the damage caused by its repeated attacks on Lebanese territory , particularly for the attack it launched against Lebanon during April 1996 , and to take action to halt the inhumane and oppressive Israeli practices against the peaceful inhabitants of occupied Lebanese territory in the south and the western Bekaa ;  
The implication that incitement to violence and violence itself is a legitimate and understandable response to political differences is irresponsible in the extreme and can only be considered complicity in the repeated deliberate attempts to escalate artificially violence in the territories .  
We request you to intervene with the Government of the United States with a view to halting these provocative actions and the obstacles being raised to the implementation of the memorandum of understanding between Iraq and the United Nations , and in order to ensure that the articles approved by the Security Council Committee established by resolution 661 ( 1990 ) are delivered and that such actions are not repeated , as they constitute a flagrant violation of the Charter of the United Nations and the precepts of international law .  
Rather , we are appealing to the conscience of the continent , as well as to individual consciences , asking that these acts of violence not be repeated , that the truth be known , that justice prevail , that the human person be respected and that the United Nations and the non-governmental organizations be permitted to work under the protection of full respect for international humanitarian law .  
On balance the amount of progress achieved is discouraging : the interminable debates that take place in Parliament are repeated in CNE , as demonstrated by the two months required to elect its bureau and the failure to establish regional commissions ( that of Kinshasa was set up in August ) .  
Apart from international humanitarian law , Article 1 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , whose wording is repeated in the preamble to the draft optional protocol , stipulates : For the purposes of the present Convention , a child means every human being below the age of 18 years unless , under the law applicable to the child , majority is attained earlier .  
It was even more dangerous when information imbalances were accompanied by aggressive policies which violated independence and national sovereignty ; Cuba continued to be the target of radio and television attacks by the Government of the United States of America in open defiance of the elementary norms of coexistence among States and the principles of international law , and despite repeated condemnation by specialized bodies and forums .  
This process involved not only the execution of suspected individuals within the leadership of each unit ( including many members of the Government and the Central Committee of the Party ) , but also the repeated wholesale arrest and killing of all of the Party cadres in a unit considered treacherous , such as a particular sector or military division .  
In its resolution 1193 ( 1998 ) of 28 August 1998 , the Security Council identified a further relevant factor when it noted the fact that despite repeated pleas by the Security Council , the General Assembly and the Secretary-General to halt foreign interference in Afghanistan , including the involvement of foreign military personnel and the supply of arms and ammunition to all parties in the conflict , such interference continued unabated .  
This clarification has been made particularly urgent since the international community has been recently exposed to repeated Palestinian arguments claiming that the transitional period will end on 4 May and hence a legal and political vacuum will ensue that should be filled by a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state . 
The absence of resolve to call upon Eritrea to withdraw from all the territories it occupied by force ( as it was required to do ) , coupled with the lack of readiness of the Eritrean regime to reverse its aggression , no doubt encouraged Asmara to embark on repeated and futile efforts to regain the Badme area in late March and late May 1999 .  
The Council condemned and deplored the repeated Israeli aerial assaults that had sought to destroy civilian installations and the infrastructure of the Lebanese Republic , had left a number of innocent civilians dead and wounded and had undermined security and stability in the region .  
The work of UNRWA continued to be affected by the continuing financial crisis that the Agency has faced since 1993 as a result of repeated shortfalls in funding for the regular budget combined with increasing refugee needs .  
It is most unfortunate that as soon as the fear of a global crisis waned , people settled for cosmetic changes and repeated the stale old platitudes about how , in due time , freely fluctuating exchange rates would bring a stability of sorts to the system ; this , notwithstanding the fact that there has been almost three decades of constant volatility since that policy was adopted and a string of crises that have grown ever more intensive and destructive . 
The period under review was marked by continuing negotiations , interrupted by repeated discord , and slow progress between the political parties and the Government of Haiti on how to continue to provide essential Government services , such as police and customs services , and how to further the cause of democracy through the organization of legislative and municipal elections .  
The developing countries , for their part , were dependent on limited overseas markets and exports and were at the mercy of the international financial institutions ; they suffered the negative consequences of globalization but had virtually no role in defining the rules of the game , and their repeated calls for democratic governance of the global economy had fallen on deaf ears .  
This early positioning for political advantage has taken place in a worsening political climate marked by increased polarization and intolerance , a rise in reports of threats and of acts of intimidation and harassment and continuing mutual mistrust between the political actors and between the latter and the Government , as well as repeated outbreaks of street violence , some undoubtedly politically motivated .  
Despite repeated appeals from United Nations bodies , bombing of the civilian population , enforced displacement both within and outside the country , summary and extrajudicial execution , violation of the right to life and the right to physical safety of prisoners of war , attacks on the civilian population , abduction and subjection to forced labour of women and children and obstruction of humanitarian assistance continued unabated .  
Furthermore , the holding in July of the Conference of the High Contracting Parties to the Fourth Geneva Convention provided an opportunity for the international community to reaffirm its support for this unarmed Arab people , who have been faced with repeated provocative and aggressive attacks , campaigns of displacement , land appropriation and the continuing and illegal colonization of its territory by the occupying Israeli forces .  
In spite of our unflinching commitment to the provisions of the NPT and repeated calls over the years to be assured , through a legally binding international instrument , against the threat or use of nuclear weapons by our powerful partners , their response has not been at all reassuring .  
Short _ term complications can include severe pain and haemorrhage that can lead to shock or even death , while long-term complications can include urine retention , resulting in repeated urinary infections ; obstruction of menstrual flow , leading to frequent reproductive tract infections and infertility ; and prolonged and obstructed labour . 21 Furthermore , FGM can result in psychological problems such as chronic anxiety and depression . 
During the special debate on poverty and the enjoyment of human rights held during the fiftysixth session , there was repeated insistence that all human rights civil , cultural , economic , political and social were at stake in situations of poverty .  
Instead of responding to the repeated calls of regional and international organizations that it take the necessary steps to demonstrate its peaceful intentions towards the State of Kuwait and other neighbouring countries and that it change its political and informational language with a view to establishing an atmosphere of confidence , Iraq at the Arab summit held in Jordan last March rejected the inclusion of a paragraph in the final declaration renewing its commitment to guaranteeing the security and sovereignty of the State of Kuwait . 
It is appropriate to recall today that , against the backdrop of an Israeli occupation that has continued for several decades , the Government of Ariel Sharon initiated a systematic policy of aggression against the Palestinian people , destroying their property , imposing economic blockades on their towns and villages and collective punishment through the repeated use of excessive and sustained force with all the weapons in the Israeli arsenal , and using force on a daily basis against unarmed Palestinian civilians .  
The ongoing series of hostile operations and the flagrant violations of Iraqs territory and airspace that are being committed by the Turkish armed forces only confirm Iraqs repeated warnings against the consequences of the duplicitous policy being pursued by Turkey vis - - vis the anomalous situation in northern Iraq and against Turkeys participation in perpetuating that situation by open interference in the internal affairs of Iraq .  
Two other repeated problems noted by internal audits were : ( a ) senior country office staff routinely approved purchase orders in the absence of a written delegation of authority from the resident representative and ( b ) lack of proper segregation of duties in procurement functions .  
[ Urges all States to refrain from taking any measure leading to the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel or of any measures aimed at altering its geographic , demographic and institutional characteristics in violation of the norms of international humanitarian law and relevant repeated United Nations resolutions ] ;  
The nature of a debt problem may vary from acute balance-of-payments difficulties ( instances of illiquidity ) to longer-term structural , financial and resource transfer problems ( cases of insolvency ) . 13 The need for repeated reschedulings of official bilateral debts appears to be related to the fact that the Paris Club approach was originally designed to address liquidity problems hence the importance attached to the cut-off date in Paris Club agreements . 
In view of the repeated massive violations of human rights and humanitarian law in Afghanistan , the High Commissioner called upon the international community to establish an independent international inquiry into the massacres and other grave human rights violations committed by parties to the armed conflict in Afghanistan .  
Despite repeated calls for a change in the current international economic , trade and financial system , which did not meet the needs of the developing countries , especially those of the most vulnerable , no specific conclusions had yet been reached .  
We are aware that it would have been impossible to take on the problems that have concerned us without facing up to the complexity of the history of mankind in terms both of its own interpretation of the repeated suffering of millions of beings and of the constantly renewed hopes of the prospect of equality and justice and of the ongoing attempt by women and men to build a better material and spiritual life .  
At present the Israeli military aircraft are still continuing their provocative acts , which reached a dangerous level yesterday when , starting at 17.20 hours , 14 military aircraft at once overflew Lebanese cities and regions at low altitudes , causing anxiety and terror among Lebanese civilians , especially children , and terrifying large numbers of tourists who had come to spend the holiday period in Lebanon , owing to the repeated breaking of the sound barrier by those aircraft during the night-time hours . 
When the patent protects a plant , animal or other organism capable of reproduction , the holder may not prevent third parties from using that entity as an initial basis for obtaining new viable biological material and marketing the material thus obtained , except where repeated use of the patented material would be required in order to obtain such material ;
