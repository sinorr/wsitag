It was precisely in this historical process that the CPC formed the CPPCC by integrating the united front theories of Marxism and Leninism with China 's specific practice .  It is a great creation and the fruit of long-term unity and struggle by the CPC along with all democratic parties , mass organizations , and the patriotic personages of all ethnic groups and all walks of life .  
The CPPCC is an organization of the Chinese people 's patriotic united front , with the most extensive representation organizationally and the greatest accommodation politically .  It is an important organization for realizing the political system of multi-party cooperation and political consultations under the leadership of the CPC , as well as an important form of socialist democratic politics which conforms with the Chinese national conditions and serves the fundamental interests of the people .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's remarks have , from a high plane of historical materialism , revealed the fundamental nature of our party ; pointed out the party 's basic tasks ; and are of an important theoretical and practical significance to our efforts to further maintain the advancement of the party , retain the vigor and vitality of the party , lead the whole party and the people of the entire country to carry out struggles in unity , and build our country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized modern socialist power .  
In furthering socialist democratic political construction , the current NPC and its standing committee revised the Village Committee Organization Law , and formulated and adopted the Law on Administrative Appeals . With these and the Administrative Litigation Law , Administrative Punishment Law , Administrative Supervision Law , and State Compensation Law formulated in earlier years , our country has basically established a complete legal system on administrative punishment and relief .  
Committee members focused on central tasks to serve the overall situation , and , from a perspective of pushing forward reform and opening , economic development , and safeguarding stability , earnestly performed their functions in conducting political consultation , exercising democratic supervision , and participating in the administration and discussion of state affairs , and offered many valuable suggestions and proposals , whose quality was better than last year .  
This has been a democratic , pragmatic , united , and inspiring meeting , which made due contribution to the comprehensive fulfillment of the goals set by the party and by the state for this year and to the promotion of the magnificent cause of socialist modernization construction .  
With a high sense of political responsibility , CPPCC members discussed major agenda , put forward many constructive views and suggestions on the administration of the country according to law , reliance on science and technology to invigorate the nation , sustainable development , great development of China 's western regions , reform of the state-owned enterprise , tackling of poverty , social security , democratic supervision , dealing with corruption , and maintaining social stability .  
Qiao Xiaoyang said : Tremendous achievements have been scored in our country 's legislation work , but some problems have also cropped up in practical legislative work as legislation progresses at an accelerated pace and the number of laws enacted multiplies , such as legislation in excess of legal power , conflict and contradiction between different laws , regulations , and rules , low legislative quality , and lack of democratic procedures in legislation .  
The motions put forth by the democratic parties and some members on narrowing the gap between schools at the compulsory education stage ; practically lightening the homework burden of primary and secondary school students ; and so on reflected the problems that had caused strong public resentment and that the education departments at all levels had to tackle without delay .  
to ensure the implementation of the party 's basic line and basic policies systematically and legally ; to ensure the party will always give play to the leading and central role of controlling overall situation and of coordinating all interests .  To develop socialist democratic politics , there is a need to persist in the four cardinal principles , in the national policy of the people 's democratic dictatorship , and in the political body of the national people 's congress system .  
By the middle of the next century , when the Chinese nation reaches the level of an intermediately developed nation with its own hard work , a wealthy , strong , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist China will stand tall in the East !  
Zeng Peiyan said : In the 21st century , China 's targets are to double the 2000 GNP by 2010 to make the people 's comparatively well-off lives even more prosperous and form a relatively complete socialist market economic system and to bring the per capita GDP to the level of an average developing country and basically achieve modernization by the middle of the century to successfully build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist country . 
The telegram says : In the past 45 years , under the leadership of the Lao People 's Revolutionary Party , the people of all nationalities in Laos won a victory in national and democratic revolution , established the Lao People 's Democratic Republic , and continuously made new achievements in safeguarding national independence and state sovereignty and developing national undertakings .  In particular , since the initiation of the innovation and opening up drive , Laos has made ceaseless progress in all undertakings and made noticeable achievements in continuously improving the people 's living standards .  
It is necessary to continue to learn from and spread the management experience of advanced enterprises , such as Hangang and Yaxing ; gradually introduce and consummate management systems and management standards that meet the requirements of market economy at such stages as production , procurement , and sales of an enterprise and in such areas as quality , costs , finance , and capital ; and develop a scientific and democratic decisionmaking system .  
] China will turn itself into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country and bring about rejuvenation of the great Chinese nation .  The Chinese people are ready to join all other peace-loving people in the rest of the world in contributing their wisdom and energy to world peace and development and an even brighter future for mankind .  
To turn China into a rich and strong , democratic , civilized modern socialist country through self-reliance and arduous struggles is the ideal shared by all Chinese nationalities in the primary stage of socialism .  
Following Jiang Zemin 's speech , Zhu Rongji said : In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin fully endorsed the important contributions rendered by the national labor models and advanced workers to reform , opening up , and the socialist modernization drive .  He spoke highly of the lofty spirit of the selfless dedication displayed by the national labor model and advanced workers .  He called on all the people to emulate these advanced models and work hard to build China into an affluent , strong , democratic , and civil socialist modern country .  
To keep to the orientation of the progress of advanced culture , it is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization , to concentrate on improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the people across the country , and to unite and mobilize the people of all nationalities throughout the country to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist state .  
The organization work is an important component part of our democratic and political building ; and to make the party 's organization work to effectively serve the country 's central task of economic construction and to provide both a firm and powerful organizational guarantee and a personnel support for the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , we must adapt the party 's organization work to the needs of the situation , improve work methods , and strive to enhance the quality of both leading bodies and the contingent of cadres .  
Various democratic parties and personalities without party affiliation holding leading posts in government and judicial organs at various levels , taking part in the state power , and participating in the management of state affairs are an important feature of the democratic parties ' participation in public affairs , which is the concrete embodiment of multiparty cooperation and political consultation system and the organizational guarantee for the practice of this basic political system .  
Giving free rein to democratic parties and non-party personalities in participating in administration and discussion of state affairs is good for the state 's policies , laws , and major decisions to embody the masses ' will to the maximum and conducive to enhancing the scientific and democratic level of the party and government 's policy decisions .  
Many of them are teachers and students .  This may bring the impact of their administrative posts , academic status , and master-student relations into the party .  Thus , it is more necessary to intensify study , enhance the ideological and theoretical quality , strictly follow the requirement of the democratic centralist system , set aright the position of an individual , approach things from the across-the-board interests of section development .  
The Party 's grassroots organizations should profoundly solve the conspicuous problems arising in strengthening the leadership over ideological and political construction , in adhering to the principle of democratic centralism , in strengthening their sense of principles and their combat strength , in conforming to the system of regular activities at grassroots organizations , and in purifying the trend at the grassroots units .  
To give play to the role of local party committees as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level through controlling the across-the-board situation and coordinating all quarters concerned , it is necessary to further reinforce the leading body of the local party committee itself , actually pursue democratic decision-making , and ensure collective leadership according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
According to Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " collective leadership , democratic centralization , individual consideration , decision-making at meetings " , we have gradually established corresponding work regulations and work systems , thus providing institutional guarantees for the local party committee to better play its role as the core of leadership in controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
The establishment of these systems made the work of the standing committee more regular , systematic , and scientific , and provided an institutional guarantee for the better implementation of the democratic centralization principle in the standing committee of the municipal party committee , and enabled it to better play its role as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level in the course of controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned .  
In some localities today , there exist such phenomena as requesting for official positions , buying and selling official positions , being responsible to only superiors but not subordinates , currying favor with the powerful , adjusting behavior to the leading cadre 's expression .  A very important cause for such phenomena is that the selection and appointment of cadres are decided by a few persons only without being subject to an effective democratic supervision .  
The most fundamental point is to , in accordance with the requirements of Comrade Jiang Zemin , consistently promote education on patriotism , the collective and socialism and to mobilize all people in the entire country to struggle for the cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics and to struggle for building China into a modernized socialist country that is rich , powerful , democratic and civilized .  
[ Zeng ] Following the progress of the economic and political structural reforms , the cadres and personnel system reform has gradually proceeded , developed in an in-depth manner , and yielded great results , during which we have gained rich experience and probed some rules .  These can be summed up in six aspects : We must hold firm to the correct direction that the organization line must serve the political line and correspond with the establishment of the socialist market economic structure and the development of socialist democratic politics ;  
The conviction of the people in socialism has been transformed into concrete practice for developing economy , improving livelihood , and building a prosperous , powerful , democratic , and civilized socialist country .  
The civilization and progress of the society , the vivid and lively political environment , and especially the socialist democratic and political life created and developed by the people under the leadership of the party have made people 's minds greatly tempered and increasingly mature .  
Whether or not we can uphold democratic centralism , regularly and consciously take up the weapon of criticism and self-criticism , and unfold active and healthy ideological struggle represent an important yardstick for measuring whether a leadership group is strong and effective and whether a leading cadre is truly upright .  
Third , cadre appointments must be based on the principle of incorruptibility .  Outstanding candidates selected through democratic procedures and proved to be honest and upright in their behavior by the assessment of the organization should be appointed to key positions without hesitation so that they may play a exemplary and guiding role in the cadre contingent and encourage all cadres to maintain the spirit of working hard in making progress .  
This requires the maintenance of the democratic centralist system and the effective implementation of the collective leadership system and the regulations for making decisions through collective discussion .  The internal supervision and the check-and-balance capacity inside leading bodies must be increased .  
The people 's democratic dictatorship as a form of state and the people 's congress system as a form of government of what our country has been pursuing are the result of the people 's struggle and a historical choice made by the people .  They are the corner stone of our country 's political system which not only suits our country 's national conditions but also reflects the substantive requirements of socialism .  
Through studying the Constitution and acquiring basic legal knowledge , the broad mass of citizens gradually acquired the consciousness of exercising rights according to laws , taking part in democratic management , fulfilling legal obligations , and maintaining their own legitimate rights and interests .  And there initially emerged in society the excellent trend of studying laws , abiding by laws , exercising laws , and maintaining laws .  
In his " On New Democracy " , written in his Yanan days , Mao Zedong put forward this slogan : " A national , scientific , popular new democratic culture . "  He defined the characteristics and direction of China 's new culture in terms of " science " and put forward the following definition of " scientific : " " It means opposing all feudal thought and superstitious thought , advocating the seeking of truth from facts , upholding objective truth , and insisting that theory and practice be consistent with each other " .  
the United States , today , should " establish an international system composed of strong alliances and organizations " with other democratic partners , and should " also be ready to step forward to defend these standards ( meaning the US concepts of values ) when they are threatened . "  
This meant that they were subject to double suffering and double tragic fate , which made the social and class contradictions of the undeveloped nations even more acute , such that they had no other way out except revolution , and outbursts of democratic revolutions in these countries became an inevitable necessity .  
On the contrary , we must be clearly aware that once the economically and culturally backward nations establish a capitalist system , they must spend appropriately long time to complete the tasks that must be completed during the capitalist stage : socialization , commercialization , industrialization , and modernization of production , as well as the establishing of appropriate democratic legal system , science and culture .  
" Special privilege " mentality , patriarchal style , obsession of hierarchy and other feudal things , in conjunction with the corrosion by decadent capitalist ideas and culture , have inflicted damage on the party building with regard to ideology , organization , and style of work , such that some leading cadres have obscured the nature and purpose of the party , even to the deterioration of the socialist democratic legal system .  
- - Attach importance to and improve strategic studies in enterprise development , implement scientific and democratic decision making in order to avoid major mistakes due to rash decisions , establish a responsibility system for major decision making in enterprises , and hold relevant personnel accountable in cases where enterprises suffer serious losses due to violations of relevant laws , regulations , and industrial policies . 
In recent years , given the complicated circumstances where international struggles changed tremendously and domestic reforms constantly intensified , and in the face of severe economic , political and natural tests , the united front promoted a united and stable political situation and also created a vigorous and vital democratic atmosphere .  It has relied most on Deng Xiaoping Theory , and united front theory for the new period , in particular .  
Given the circumstances of the socialist market economy , the Party Central Committee has also adapted to the transition in the Party 's approach toward leadership and managing state affairs , has realistically improved Party leadership , displayed Party leadership of the united front on democratic consultation , made the Party 's correct stand become the common ground of the vast majority of members of the united front , and united and led them to work for the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
In recent years , relevant mass organizations such as various democratic parties and associations of industry and commerce have gradually experienced political transitions where new leading members have replaced old ones , united and mutually beneficial national relations have been further consolidated , and major progress has been made in relations between religion and socialist society ; the most fundamental reason for all of this is that a high-quality contingent of non-party leaders has been cultivated .  
Because of all this , it has become a top priority for the Chinese in the post-Deng era to diligent pursue the establishment of effective supervision mechanisms suited for China 's national conditions and to promote democratic system innovation in a situation of relative political stability , so as to prevent China from being trapped in endemic corruption and an " emergency room paradox " resulting from the dilemma created by the contradictions . 
The second contradiction is that in the process of international interactions in the post-Cold War era , international contradictions and conflicts may lead to the formation of the current of thought of radical nationalism which will get combined with leftist speech because of the existence of a large amount of leftist speech in China 's traditional ideological resources , resulting in the undermining of balanced development of pluralist intellectual differentiation and , eventually , affecting the democratic process . 
In upholding the people 's democratic dictatorship , we must properly preserve national sovereignty , security , unity , and stability on the basis of people 's democracy , crack down hard according to law on lawbreaking and criminal activities that jeopardize the socialist system , reform , opening up , and socialist modernization , and people 's lives and property , and give full play to its role in protecting the people and cracking down on the enemy .  
In 2000 , the Ninth Five-Year for National Economic and Social Development was successfully completed , the development of the western region got off to a good start , and the economy developed in a healthy way .  During that year , China 's democratic and legal systems were continuously strengthened , and its human rights situation maintained a good momentum of development .  
In light of China 's national conditions and according to the people 's wishes , the Chinese government aims to build a democratic and modernized country with a high level of civilization under the rule of law , and actively learn from the beneficial experiences and cultural achievements of other countries .  While maintaining social stability , it also aims to expedite development , strengthen the democratic legal system , promote spiritual civilization , and continuously push forward the development of the human rights cause .  
Implementing the revised Regional National Autonomy Law will play a greater role in further keeping to and improving the system of regional national autonomy in our country , accelerating economic and social development in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities , protecting unification of the country , strengthening unity of people of various nationalities , ensuring social stability , and building a rich , powerful , democratic , civilized and modernized socialist country .  
Doing a good job in selecting and promoting female cadres and recruiting more female party members is a need in our efforts to fulfill the new tasks under the new situation , to meet the " three represents " requirement , and to build a strong high-quality cadre contingent and to reinforce the party rank and file , and is also an important component part of our work in developing socialist democratic politics and promoting social progress .  
China is a socialist country of the people 's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance , and our party is the sole political party of the Chinese proletariat , the core of leadership of the socialist cause , and the creator of our armed forces .  This determines the scientific and correct nature of the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces .  
The people of all ethnic groups in China are united as one , and are working hard together with one heart to build our country into a strong , prosperous , democratic , civilized and modern socialist country .  
Under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee , all CPV members and the Vietnamese people will work with one heart and move forward in unity according to the principles laid down by the Ninth CPV National Congress ; will successfully fulfill the strategic targets proposed by the congress ; and will build Vietnam into a powerful , democratic , civilized , socialist , and industrialized country where the people live in prosperity .  
Third , the reserve cadre contingent was strengthened to a new degree .  According to the working guideline of " replenishing leading bodies and strengthening reserve force , " through the procedures of democratic recommendation and strict evaluation by the party organizations , outstanding young cadres were added to the reserve cadre contingents at various levels .  These promising young cadres have good political quality and strong work ability , and they are now selected as candidates for leading positions at a higher level .  
Wei Jianxing expressed the hope that the broad masses of staff members and workers would take model workers as models , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , heighten their fighting spirit and work in a down-to-earth manner in line with the requirements of the " three represents , " and strenuously struggle to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized socialist modern country .  
We are convinced that , under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by Nong Duc Manh , the Vietnamese people will surely follow the policies set at the congress , work hard in unity to victoriously fulfill the set strategic objectives , and built Vietnam into a rich , strong , fair , democratic , civilized yet industrialized socialist country .  
We profoundly believe that under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by General Secretary Nong Duc Manh , by following the guidelines and policies set by the Ninth CPV Congress , and working with concerted and united efforts , the Vietnamese people will victoriously achieve the strategic goals set down , and build Vietnam into a rich and strong , socially fair , democratic , and civilized socialist industrialized country .  
Having sufficient weapons and equipment is merely one of the conditions for ensuring national security , and other important conditions include peaceful and stable cross-strait relations , brisk and active economic development and competitiveness , and a sound and mature democratic political system .  
The foreign ministers stress that the international prestige of the " Shanghai Five " has been enhanced and it has become an increasingly influential positive factor in safeguarding regional and world peace , security , and stability .  It is also playing an important role in promoting the multipolarization of the world and establishing a new international political and economic order that is fair , reasonable , and democratic .  
A careful reading of the facts of the case reveals that this political agenda , pursued essentially through external forces , is three projects rolled into one - splitting Tibet from China , carving out a ' Greater Tibet ' through ethnic cleansing , and restoring a moth-eaten theocracy , the ancient regime with some modest , if not quite cosmetic , ' democratic ' changes .  
The basic question of the trade union work is an issue of safeguarding rights .  All work of the trade union should be carried out in close connection with this most fundamental issue , that is , safeguarding the economic interests and democratic rights of workers and staff members and fulfilling their spiritual and cultural needs .  
Political party politics is especially far from maturity - - the old system has been destroyed , but the new rules and new standards are not yet completely set up .  Even though the new system has already been established , it does not yet get its due respect and lacks authority , and the so-called " democratic system " does not exist .  Rather , the politicians lack " democratic accomplishments , " and the sudden turnover of political parties has inevitably led to violent political , economic , and social upheaval .  
Referring to the situation where cadres still lack a democratic and legal system , the 13th Party Congress consequently proposed to regard the establishment of a state public functionary system as the focus for reforming the personnel system of cadres to conduct scientific management of the contingent of cadres according to law ; thus transforming the previous outdated unitary management pattern and allowing the establishment of a new-type personnel system of cadres based on the principles of attaching importance to solid performance , encouraging competition , and exercising democratic and separated supervisions .  
Over the last 50 years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet , epoch-making and deep-going changes have taken place in Tibet . It has completed democratic reform , abolished the feudal serf system , and realized the regional autonomy of minority nationalities .  Millions of serfs who did not even have basic human rights in the past have truly become masters of society and the country .  
Attention should be paid to fostering citizen 's modern legal concept of equal rights and obligations and strengthening their sense of abiding by the law and discipline , protecting their own legitimate rights and interests , and engaging in democratic participation and supervision .  
In accordance with the relevant provisions of laws , it is necessary to formulate Village regulations , the rules of conduct for villagers , residents ' pledges , and the rules for managing basic units according to law , to set up an effective operating mechanism , to exercise democratic management and supervision , and to strengthen legitimate management at the basic level .  
Only when we adapt ourselves to the transformation from a planned economic structure to a market economic structure and only when we materialize the change from a structure ruled by man which is based on a highly developed centralization of individual power to a democratic structure ruled by law can we open up a new prospect in " the building of a socialist country ruled by law , " indicated Wang Guixiu .  
People 's democratic dictatorship is the fundamental road to Tibet 's development and stability .  To uphold people 's democratic dictatorship in Tibet , we must make constant efforts to foster socialist democracy , perfect the system of regional autonomy in areas inhabited by minority nationalities , firmly crack down on sabotages committed by the Dalai clique and on all kinds of criminal activities harmful to national security , safeguard the motherland 's unification and ethnic unity , and seriously protect the fundamental interests of the masses .  
The objective of the Fourth 5-Year Plan on Law Popularization is to realize " two points of improvement " and " two transformations . "  The two points of improvement refers to , in light of the principle of our constitution and the development progress of socialist democratic legal construction in the new development stage , profoundly promoting educational activities to disseminate the law and comprehensively improve the legal quality of all citizens as a whole , particularly leading cadres at all levels .  
We have also emphasized that since the party 's leadership means ideological , political and organizational leadership , party committees must bring into play their role in assuming overall responsibility and coordinating the work of different quarters and make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
They should continue to carry forward democracy and play a positive and active role in advancing the building of democratic politics in the capital , actively assist the party committee and the government in coordinating relations of all sides and resolving contradictions , thus safeguarding the social and political stability of the national capital .  
If this situation is not resolved , people will be unable to clearly distinguish between the problems of national position , the independence and reunification issue and values of political parties and ideology , and will be unable to understand that free and democratic human rights can not supersede the framework of national sovereignty and the integrity of territory .  The DPP government of Chen Shui-bian can not let go of their evil intentions in the form of a coalition government .  
At the beginning of the 20th century , Sun Yat-sen led the revolution of 1911 , aimed at overthrowing the autocratic monarchical system that had governed China over thousands of years .  This revolution marked the beginning of the genuine national democratic revolution in the history of modern China and paved the way for China 's progress .  However , this revolution still failed in changing China 's nature of a semi-colonial and semi-feudalistic society and saving the Chinese people from miseries .  
On the basis of meticulously reviewing the positive and negative experiences , recollecting its courage and confidence and correcting its mistakes , the party established and adhered to the ideological line of seeking the truth from facts , gradually understood the practical situation of China , created a road of " circling cities with rural areas and taking over political power through arms " ? which suited the Chinese practical situation and won the victory of a modern national democratic revolution .  
Mao Zedong opposed book worship and started out from the actual conditions of the Chinese revolution to skillfully combine basic Marxist principles with China 's revolutionary practices and creatively develop Marxism and Leninism . He advanced the new democratic revolution theory and the theory of embarking on the road of surrounding the cities with villages , and with that , he seized victory in the Chinese revolution and truly achieved the first great leap in integrating basic Marxist and Leninist principles with China 's realistic conditions .  
Answer : A host of facts has proved that Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult organization have completely transformed into an out-and-out reactionary political organization and a political force and have become the tool of international anti-China forces and the splittist forces in Taiwan for subverting the political power of our people 's democratic dictatorship and the socialist system and for undermining national unification .  
They " removed the red star but kept their red heart , and changed their cap insignia but did not change their tradition " .  Their heart is forever facing the CPC . In the course of fulfilling their task of national liberation , our army never forgot their mission of democratic revolution , were sober-minded , smashed the KMT created incidents of " friction " within the united front , maintained high morale at the end of the national war , waged resolute struggle against the KMT reactionaries , and won final victory in the liberation war .  
In order to strengthen guidance for building rural grass-roots party organizations , the central authorities and relevant departments promulgated in succession the " CPC regulations governing the work of rural grass-roots organizations " , the " opinions of the organization department of the CPC Central Committee on strengthening the building of ranks of rural grass-roots cadres " , the " circular on universally implementing in the rural areas the systems of making village affairs public and managing village affairs in a democratic way " , and other important documents .  
During his 12 years in power , Lee Teng-hui played political trickery to the utmost , excluded those not agreeing with him , was tyrannical and domineering , and , mechanically copying the Western parliamentary democracy model , directed several " constitutional amendments " and elections , prompting Taiwan to become a place " filled with a sense of confrontation and hatred " and distorting all mechanisms of a modern democratic society .  
The first leap took place during the new democratic revolutionary period .  The first generation of central leadership collective with Mao Zedong at the core led the whole party and the people throughout the country to find China 's own revolutionary road through repeated explorations and on the basis of summing up successful and unsuccessful experiences , and established Mao Zedong Thought .  
and it played an important role in consolidating people 's democratic dictatorship , and in pushing forward the historical process of socialist revolution and construction in China .  With the arrival of the new historical period , the China Democratic League has showed its firm support for the line , principles , and policies that the CPC has adopted ever since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee ; conscientiously performed its role as a party participating in government and political affairs ;  
In the period of socialist revolution and construction , to strive for national prosperity and strengthening , our party continued to consolidate and expand the people 's democratic united front in the efforts for restoring the economy , developing production , carrying out socialist transformation , establishing the socialist system , and starting the comprehensive explorations of socialist construction .  
We must rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and , in line with the requirement of the three represents , carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions , closely follow the advancing pace of the times , emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , carry out hard struggle , forge ahead , and strive to turn our country into a rich , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist country .  
I hope the masses of science and technology workers will stay on the cutting edge of the new era , closely integrating personal ambitions with the nation 's future and fate ; undertake the historical responsibility of promoting science and technology advancements and innovations ; and continuously contribute to developing China into a prosperous , democratic , and civilized modern socialist country .  
In the period of the democratic revolution , his main contribution was to combine the universal truth of Marxism with China 's specific conditions and set forth the theory of new democracy , which resolved the question of how to take the path of the Russians , and thus resolved a major difficult issue in the course of Sinicizing Marxism .  
Without enhancing the level of productive forces , it is impossible to consolidate the political power , maintain social stability , improve the living standards of the people , and develop the spiritual civilization and the democratic and legal system .  
Since its birth , the party " has been fighting not only for political and economic revolution in China , but also for cultural revolution in our country . "  Liu Yunshan pointed out : The party developed a new democratic culture - - a national , scientific and mass culture .  
It is hoped that CPPCC organizations at all levels , all democratic parties and mass organizations participating in the CPPCC , including the federation of industrialists and businessmen , will take actions according to their own conditions by taking the experience exchanged at this meeting as reference , work out their methods of advancing the work of finding out and reflecting social conditions and popular opinions , and effectively implement the spirit of this meeting .  
Over the past 80 years , the people of all ethnic groups , the democratic parties , and progressive figures in all circles in our country always share weal and woe and fight side by side together with our party for our nation 's independence , prosperity , and bright future .  In the historical process of revolution , construction , and reform , they demonstrate a strong patriotic spirit and an indomitable fighting spirit .  
The purpose of the new democratic revolution led by our party was to abrogate the imperialist privileges in China , eliminate exploitation and oppression by the landlord class and the bureaucrat-capitalist class , change the comprador feudal production relations and the rotten political superstructure built on such an economic base , establish a new political superstructure with the people 's democratic dictatorship as the core and fundamentally emancipate the fettered productive forces .  
Under no circumstances should comrades of the whole party stand still and refuse to move forward , nor should they fear hardship and difficulties .  We must closely unite with people of all ethnic groups in China and strive to build the great motherland into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country so as to make new and even greater contributions to humanity .  
All comrades of the party must unswervingly implement the party 's basic line for the initial stage of socialism , consistently concentrate on economic development , stick to the Four Cardinal Principles [ keeping to the socialist road and upholding the people 's democratic dictatorship , leadership by the Communist Party , and Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought ] , press ahead with reform and opening up , strive for the realization of the basic program of the party for the present stage and constantly advance the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics into the future .  
Under no circumstances should comrades of the party stand still and refuse to move forward , nor should they fear hardship and difficulties .  All comrades must closely unite with the people of all ethnic groups in China and strive to build our great motherland into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country and make new and even greater contributions to mankind .  
We should learn from them their setting strict discipline for the party , implementing the principle of democratic centralism , being impartial and upright , setting strict demand on self , working hard , having clean hands , and daring to fight against unhealthy tendencies .  
responsible persons of central committees of democratic parties , the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce , and mass bodies concerned ; and figures from various united front circles who are in Beijing , including non-party figures , representatives of intellectuals outside the CPC , representatives of ethnic and religious circles , and representatives of Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan compatriots and overseas Chinese compatriots .  
and was an out and out dictator .  He blindly followed western parliamentary and democratic elections in disregard of specific conditions , which caused endless wrangles among parties and factions , continuous upheaval in the political situation , and serious economic losses .  
The links and procedures for competitive appointment must be improved and quantity graded method for such links as written tests , interviews , democratic polls and evaluations must be formulated , and examinations must be organized .  Mass participation in this program must be expanded and public introduction of candidates before their appointments must be improved .  
According to Deng Xiaoping 's idea about building new-type party-to-party relations , our party adopted the basic principles of " independence and self-determination , complete equality , mutual respect , and mutual non-interference in the other side 's internal affairs " for party-to-party relations .  By casting aside previous grievances and looking ahead to the future , we gradually restored friendly relations with Communist Parties and Workers ' Parties in other countries .  At the same time , we also gradually came into extensive contacts with nationalist and democratic political parties in developing countries .  
We must study their style of learning in which the vigorous promotion of theory is tied to reality , resolutely arming ourselves with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and particularly Deng Xiaoping theory and the important concept of the " three represents , " concentrating on the study of modern scientific and technical knowledge , market economy knowledge , and knowledge of democratic legal systems , etc . , striving to master our main occupations and continually improving ourselves .  
He always persisted in taking basic Marxist theory on the state and law as guidance , carefully took into account the actual situation in our country 's legal construction , and strove to explore and build a sound juridical system of the people , thus making exceptional contributions toward our country 's socialist democratic construction and legal construction and being regarded by all as a key founder of the legal system of the New China .  
The system of division of labor with individual responsibilities for senior officers under the unified and collective leadership of Party committees is the realization pattern for implementing the system of democratic centralism in the army , a fundamental system for exercising absolute leadership of the Party over the army , and also an effective mechanism for Party committees to exercise leadership over the troops .  
Yu Muming said in his briefing : In addition to the six points of common understanding , the understanding of the delegation of the New Party 's Mainland Affairs Committee about one China and peaceful reunification is that the Chinese people on both sides of the strait should reunify Taiwan with the Mainland , which are now separated from each other , and make concerted efforts to build a democratic and prosperous China belonging to the Chinese nation .  
China 's and Russia 's further enhancing strategic cooperation , joint dedication to maintaining world peace , bringing about common development , promoting the multi-polar process in the world and establishing a new , democratic , and rational international political and economic order are the requirements that the situation has called upon us , which are our unshirkable responsibilities .  
China and Russia should further strengthen their strategic cooperation , and work jointly to safeguard world peace , promote common development , promote the process of the world 's multi-polarization , promote the establishment of a new international political and economic order of being democratic , just , and reasonable .  This is a requirement set forth by the current situation for us , and is also our unshirkable responsibility .  
During the period of democratic revolution , given the special conditions of our country at the time , we had no choice but to base our revolution in the rural areas , so the working class and the peasants formed a close alliance .  As a result , the majority of the members of our Party and the revolutionary troops led by the Party were peasants .  
The historical mission for the current period put forth by our Party is , through reform and opening-up , to further liberate and develop the productive forces , promote national economic , political and cultural development in an all-around way , continuously improve people 's material and cultural standards of living , strive to build China into a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , modernized socialist country , and strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people .  
Our objective is : By the middle of this century , we will basically achieve modernization , build a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , and socialist modern country , and realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
China and Russia will further strengthen strategic cooperation , together advance the world multipolarization process and the building of a democratic , fair , and rational new economic order , and work together to preserve world peace and promote joint development , This is the objective requirement of the current development of the international situation and is also the unshirkable major responsibility of the two countries .  
We are willing to continue to strengthen cooperation in the international arena and make joint efforts to promote the establishment of a democratic , fair and rational new international political and economic order and to create a new world of lasting peace and universal prosperity .  
As result of the democratic reform and socialist transformation as well as the ongoing reforms and opening up , Tibet has liberated and developed its social productivity in an unprecedented scale .  Last year , the region 's gross domestic product was more than 50 times that of the period before the democratic reform in 1959 .  
The system according to which the leading commander of a military unit is responsible for this unit and which stipulates that this unit should be under the collective leadership of the Party committee of this unit as well ? is a way to carry out the democratic centralization system in the military ; it is the fundamental system for adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military and is an effective mechanism for Party committees to lead military forces .  
Our army is the massive pillar of the people 's democratic dictatorship .  The Constitution has entrusted us with the sacred duty of consolidating our national defense , resisting aggression , defending our motherland , and safeguarding the people 's labor in peace .  Moreover , to uphold the Party 's centralized power and unity of the state is our army 's basic prerequisite and necessary requirement to perform these duties .  
Since the peaceful liberation 50 years ago , Tibet has witnessed profound social changes , including the democratic reform as well as reform and opening up , and has scored world-renowned successes in its political , economic , and cultural development .  
In carrying out political structure reforms , we want to further carry forward socialist democracy and legal system , perfect the specific systems of socialist democracy , ensure that the people can fully exercise their rights of democratic election , democratic decisionmaking , democratic management , and democratic supervision , boost the vitality of the party and state , fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the grass roots and the masses , promote the effort to make decisionmaking a scientific and democratic affair , and bring into further play the superiority and characteristics of the socialist system .

After the Cold War started , the United States abandoned halfway a democratic reform designed for Japan and stopped short of cleaning up the Japanese militarism .  Nor did the United States liquidate Japan 's bureaucratic institutions left over from the pre-war period .  
Specifically speaking , it is necessary to create a rather positive working environment , a harmonious and agreeable environment of interpersonal relationships , an academic environment that is democratic and lively , a rather comfortable living environment , and a social environment that is respectful and understanding .  
Over the past 20-odd years , the Chinese Government has overcome various difficulties .  It has successfully transformed a contingent of leading cadres who were quite old and whose educational levels were quite low into another contingent of leading cadres who are " relatively young " and " knowledgeable . "  Immediately afterward , it has vigorously launched another round of reform in the systems governing cadres and personnel which aims to be more democratic in the process of hiring officials .  
Local figures believe : Striving to be more democratic in the process of hiring officials will not only exert positive and far-reaching impacts on China 's efforts to prevent and crack down on corrupt activities , but also definitely facilitate a comprehensive , sustained , and rapid development in China 's social and economic endeavors .  
Zeng Peiyan says : Looking ahead , China will , by the middle of the next century , have attained its third-step strategic objective and become an affluent , powerful , democratic , and civil socialist modern country and the Chinese nation will have achieved its great revitalization !  
A tremendous change , which is hardly detected by people , has occurred in the trend of China 's political thinking .  The change has occurred since China launched the drive of reform and opening up about 20 years ago .  The trend shows that a rational democratic concept and attitude has begun to be the main stream of social life , enabling China to have a very important and stable foundation for further political reform .  
One of the most prominent mistakes in this misunderstanding zone is this : Some immature methods adopted in the past by the Chinese intellectual elite and common Chinese people in their pursue of democracy have been considered as China 's democratic methods .  These methods have been treated as a standard for the evaluation of China 's current democratic progress .  Consequently , a misunderstanding zone has been created .  
Likewise , in this vicious circle , people have accustomed to this situation : Instead of doing rational and sober thinking about democratic progress and doing things in a thoroughgoing manner , people have accustomed to raucous campaigns and movements .  They have accustomed to this idea : The first thing to do is to destroy all the things that are old .  
The great and universal imperial power has suppressed all democratic practices that seem promising .  It has made budding democracy disappear in the long river of history by killing it in the bud .  As a result , democracy has not been able to form a tradition in our political culture , or become a tradition of non-main stream .  
Due to these objective factors , neither the broad masses of people nor the leading elite of democratic movement has conducted profound thinking from a rational viewpoint before they adopt democracy , which is considered as a good medicine to cure China 's political and social problems .  As a result , the above-mentioned abnormal phenomena have been created .  In fact , no one should be blamed for the phenomena .  
In addition , with the continuous improvement of democracy and the construction of the legal system , they have made prominent progress in democratic supervision , participation in and deliberation of state affairs , religious beliefs , and other political rights .  So long as China continues to follow the road of development that is in line with its national situation , China will achieve major progress in its social and economic development and the Chinese people will enjoy an even higher level of human rights .  
Ye Xuanping also summed up the new progress made by the CPPCC National Committee in making the democratic channels unimpeded and reflecting the social situation and popular will , safeguarding unity and stability and developing the united front , unfolding non-government diplomacy and expanding friendly contacts , and strengthening its own construction and improving the work of its organs .  
In addition , the Chinese Government 's ban of the cult Falungong and the nationwide drive to expose and repudiate it have dealt a powerful blow to the cult 's criminal activities designed to poison the public , disrupt social order , and subvert the government .  This has helped stabilize society and is conducive to the popularization of science and democratic ideas and to the rule of law .  
As soon as the central authorities put forward the strategic decision of implementing the strategy of a large-scale west development , people 's political consultative conferences at all levels and all democratic parties have given a positive response , gone into immediate action , and unfolded the work in many aspects .  
Member Wang Daming suggested that the CPPCC step up its democratic supervision and strive to curb corruptive practices .  In spite of the fact that such supervision does not carry the legal force for mandatory compliance or disciplinary restraint , it nevertheless can play a guiding , warning , suppression and publicity role .  When exercised in coordination with authoritative supervision , it will produce an even greater influence .  
These non-traditional acts of violence are not accepted as legal national means of war by today 's international military systems and by modern international laws on armed confrontation , because by most countries ' existing laws and moral order , most of those acts are clearly and unmistakably illegal acts of violence .  A country founded on laws and democratic traditions can not regard an illegal act as a legal means .  
A short time ago , the Legislative Council members of the " democratic factions " proposed a motion to " revise the Basic Law , " demanding that all the members of the Legislative Council be elected through direct voting ahead of schedule , and that the chief executive of the HKSAR be directly elected by way of " one man one vote . "  
Therefore , in actual life , freedom of press is a free and democratic right approved [ ren ke 6126 0668 ] and protected by the law .  Meanwhile , there are also specific limiting stipulations to prevent the wanton use of freedom of press in order to more effectively protect the realization of freedom of press .

We must , in the patriotic spirit of Comrades Li Fuchun and Cai Chang , encourage the entire party and the people of the whole country to support from beginning to end taking economic construction as the center , industriously establishing China as a powerful , democratic , and civilized modernized socialist country , realizing the grand reemergence of the People 's Republic in the 21st Century .  
Family planning associations at the grass-roots level should take an active part in exercising democratic management and supervision over family planning and making family planning matters in the villages known to the public , and advance grass-roots democracy , legal institutions , and spiritual civilization , so as to promote social and economic development and political stability .  
The Tibet issue has all along been a " human rights " hot spot ; even then the CSHRS has not evaded this difficult issue but instead has expounded , with a host of facts , on the great changes that have taken place since Tibet implemented the democratic reform and wiped out the feudal serfdom to refute the Dalai clique and international hostile forces ' distortions of and attacks on Tibet 's human rights situation .  
It is true that the new Taiwan leader purposely and very nicely packaged " Taiwan independence " theories and did not specifically mention " Taiwan independence " at all .  However , the main theme of " Taiwan independence " permeated the whole speech .  He particularly stressed the " democratic and equal " status between " Taiwan " and " China , " purposely severed the connections between Taiwan and mother mainland , and words and sentences about splittist concepts and separatism were abundant .  
They completed the initial draft of the " great democratic constitution " in June that year ; this openly proclaimed that " Taiwan and mainland China should be based on the principle of peace , equality , coexistence , and mutual benefit , and respect each other 's national sovereignty and the integrity of the right to rule the areas under their jurisdiction , " and " the governments of Taiwan and mainland China should deal with all business according to international law and convention . "  
We have mentioned earlier in this article that the Taiwan authorities , who are holding high the " democracy and human rights " banner , have always vilified the motherland and the Chinese Communists to seek benefits for themselves .  As a result of extensive publicity and slander over a long period , a simple psychological pattern has been created in the Taiwan people that the mainland 's socialist system and the Chinese Communists ' leadership is no good and not free and democratic , whereas Taiwan 's capitalist system is good , free , and democratic .  
The making of these top-level , knowledge-intensive decisions requires that comrades of the NPC must have a high ideological , theoretical and policy level and possess various kinds of scientific and specialized knowledge .  Otherwise they will not be able to formulate distinct , precise , specific and feasible laws and regulations that embody the party 's views , represents the will of the whole nation , and conform with the laws of objective reality , and it will not be possible to make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
Four major changes will emerge in China in the next 10 years to meet the new situation of technological progress and economic globalization in the world .  The speech of Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out the bright future of China , heartened the confidence of 1.2 billion people in building a prosperous , powerful , and democratic China , and inspired the willingness of foreign businesses to increase investment in China .  
When the " 4 June " incident took place on the mother mainland in 1989 , the statements made by the then new Taiwan leader involved the phrases with Chinese historical complex , such as the " free Republic of China " " supported its patriotic compatriots , " who should " closely unite as one " to " realize democratic reunification . "  One-China that Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo followed during their rule of Taiwan for decades can " carefully be observed " in their statements .  
Having made achievements of world interest during the five decades since it came into power in leading the people in carrying out socialist revolution and construction as well as the reform and opening to the outside world and in unremittingly struggling to build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country , our party is worthy of being the choice of history and the people .  
Viewed as a whole , all of our party 's efforts in leading the revolution , construction , and reform have been for emancipating and developing the productive forces and for advancing the development of China 's socialist democratic politics and culture and thus have complied with the objective law of social development , conformed to the advanced trends of development of the times , safeguarded the overall interests of the Chinese nation , and accorded with the fundamental demands of the masses of the people .  
This policy forced the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan to lift the Martial Law at the end of 1986 and to open up indirect " three links " on both sides of the strait , enabled Taiwan to have opportunities to carry out a series of social , political and economic reforms under a peaceful environment , and facilitated democratic politics and free market economy in Taiwan .  
When conducting a " strategic security tour " to Washington in April 1999 , he had extensive contacts with US congressmen and officials .  One of his purposes was to " express firmly to them that the security , dignity , and development in Taiwan must be safeguarded and supported .  A free and democratic Taiwan is the key to global strategic security and one of the links in US national interests . "  
On the track of the Basic Law , Hong Kong 's original capitalist system and way of life have been successfully extended , the Hong Kong people are enjoying more democratic rights and a greater freedom , and its legal system has been strengthened on a constant basis .  All this has won the repeated acclamations of the whole world .  
Under the main orientation of orderly and gradual development of Hong Kong 's democratic political system , the Basic Law lays down the method for producing the chief executive and legislative organs of the SAR , and there are clear regulations on the emergence and appointment of the chief executive and the leading officials .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized : In undertaking the large-scale development of the western region , leading bodies at various levels should do better in making decisions in a democratic and scientific way ; all major decisions , such as those concerning construction and development , key construction projects , and defrayal of a large amount of funds , we must act according to the principles of democratic centralism , hold collective discussions , and carefully make decisions in order to prevent what a few leaders say counts or to avoid taking hasty decisions .  
As for the affairs that can not be resolved in line with market mechanism but still need go through procedures of government examinations and approvals , we should scientifically divide powers , set up strict interactive supervisory and restraint mechanisms , and prevent a small number of people or individuals from abuse of powers .  We should improve collective policymaking mechanisms and hold collective discussions to decide the affairs that are related to the personal interests of the people strictly according to the principle of democratic centralism .  Making administrative affairs transparent is not a goal .  
In particular , in 1999 , centering on major events such as the 50th anniversary of the founding of the state , the 40th anniversary of the democratic revolution in Tibet , the Lhasa area contests of the sixth national ethnic minority games , and the reversion of Macao , the whole region carried out two major checks on the use of script in society , with the focus on Lhasa , and achieved regular , artistic , and clean use of script in society , thus displaying a good image of Tibet .  
4 ) Speed up the process of making the leading and ruling systems more scientific , democratic , and institutionalized ; perfect the supervisory mechanisms of the party , the masses , and the media so that those with the motive to commit craft can not do so .  
He indicated that , by insisting on being guided by Deng Xiaoping theory and resolutely implementing the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and various plans from the central authorities , and in keeping with the reality of their own situations , the broad cadres and masses in Heilongjiang and Jilin have struggled hard and forged ahead , producing new achievements in the promotion of economic development , the transformation of the old industrial base , Party-building , the establishment of a democratic legal system , and cultural and ideological development .  
For instance , some lack systematic study of Marxist theory ; they lack proper political sensitivity and ability to make political distinctions , lack profound understanding of the party 's fine traditions and work style , lack strict tempering in party life and awareness of democratic centralism , and lack the ability to master complex situations and resolve complex contradictions , and so on .  
Under the system of multiparty cooperation led by the CPC , the democratic parties unite and cooperate with the ruling party in exerting for the cause of building socialism .  Together , they have created a stable environment for liberating and developing the productive forces and maintaining the sustainable development of the economy , thus enabling China to make achievements of world interest in economic construction .  
Wang Zhaoguo emphasized that strengthening the training of young and middle-aged leading cadres among the democratic parties and establishing a contingent of high-caliber cadres of democratic parties is a strategic task with a vital bearing on the overall situation of multiparty cooperation , a basic guarantee for upholding and perfecting the system of multiparty cooperation and system of political consultation under the leadership of the CPC , as well as the pressing need for bringing into play the role of parties participating in the administration of state affairs and an effective measure for further realizing political handover .  
and have also played an important role in promoting a democratic and scientific policymaking process .  Facts prove that to conduct investigation and study on selected major questions of economic and social development in a planned way is a good form for the democratic parties , the Federation of Industry and Commerce and non-party personages to participate in the administration and discussion of state affairs and exercise democratic supervision ; and it is also a good way to do the united front work under the historical conditions .  
Since the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , our Party has led the people in the unwavering promotion of reforms of the economic and political systems , establishing and promoting a socialist market economy system , developing socialist democratic politics with Chinese characteristics , and liberating and developing the social productive forces to the maximum , raising China 's overall national strength to a new level .  
In order to deepen the study and carry out in a comprehensive way Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's theory on democratic legal system and General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of the " three represents , " the NPC Standing Committee held a study class for chairmen of the people 's congress standing committees at provincial level in Beijing from 25 to 28 September .  
He first expressed his warm welcome to the friends who have come from afar , and extended his sincere greetings and festival wishes to various democratic parties , public figures without party affiliation , personalities from various mass groups , ethnic groups , and social circles across the country , compatriots from Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan , and overseas Chinese .  
Now we are beginning to carry out the third-step strategy , that is , by the middle of the 21st century , China 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita will reach the level of moderately developed countries , and we will basically realize modernization and build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist country .  
Li Ruihuan stressed : The CPPCC is an important organization for political consultation , democratic supervision , and participation and deliberation in politics , and should contribute toward the formulation of the " 10th Five-Year Plan . " The CPPCC is widely representative and unique in its position ; it has a pool of qualified personnel , smooth channels , and conditions to forward good opinions and suggestions on major policies for the country .  
While concentrating our energies on achieving agricultural and rural economic development , we must really have a good grasp of the building of rural grassroots organizations , democratic legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization , maintain social stability in the rural areas , and give impetus to the rural economic and social development in a comprehensive way .  
In light of the new rural situation in the new stage , we should carry out education on the party 's basic line and rural policies , the socialist and collective spirit , the transformation of established traditions and practices , the democratic legal system , as well as science and culture .  
Only by so doing , can they better implement their sacred mission entrusted by the party and the people .  They said : In accordance with the guiding spirit of the " proposal , " we will focus on the overall construction of the armed forces , strive to push forward socialist spiritual civilization construction as well as democratic and legal construction .  
Hong Kong is a society ruled by law .  However , because of the adverse currents created by those politicians , who call themselves " democrats , " who fight China , make troubles in Hong Kong , and " overthrow Tung Chee-hwa , " this society has lost its harmony and is replete with reckless behaviors .  Currently some Legco members of the " democratic faction " have even taken the lead in violating the law and rebuffing the rule of law in our special administrative region .  
We must link the major decisions on reform and development with legislation , gradually forming decision-making mechanisms which have a deep understanding of the feelings of the people , which fully reflect the will of the people , and which concentrate the wisdom of the people in an extensive manner , promoting more scientific and democratic decision-making and improving the level and efficiency of decision-making . 
It is also necessary to speed up formulating and perfecting the laws and regulations in the areas of developing socialist democratic politics , standardizing the administrative and judicial systems , tightening the supervision over power operation , promoting the building of a clean and honest government , and so on , in a bid to push forward the political structural reform and deepen the administrative and judicial structural reforms .  
President Jiang Zemin proposed that on the basis of democratic consultation with full participation by the nations , practical international rules should be drawn up to ensure that the process of economic globalization will be able to gain correct guidance and management , advance in the direction of helping to narrow the differences between north and south and rich and poor , and help to promote world economic balance , stability , and sustainable development .  
Again , some polling stations opened earlier than scheduled , lost votes , needed a re-vote , and even found out that votes were exchanged for cigarettes , damaging the solemn election and making the democratic election undemocratic .  
Especially during the past 20 and more years since the introduction of reform and opening up , the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and the Chinese Catholic Bishops College have cooperated with each other closely , forged ahead in unity , assisted the party and government in implementing the policy of religious freedom , pushed forward the development of patriotic organizations , vigorously nurtured middle-aged and young patriotic clerics , actively promoted democratic management of churches , striven to adapt to socialist society , and brought about progress and development in various church undertakings by leaps and bounds .  
The leadership collective persists in pooling the united front 's strength and wisdom from all sides for the central task of economic construction , thereby forging a united , stable , invigorating , and active political situation , and spurring the constant advancement of China 's reform , opening up , and modernization drive .  The leadership collective upholds and perfects the system of multi-party cooperation led by the CPC and the system of political consultation , thereby promoting socialist democratic political construction and further strengthening the people 's democratic dictatorship and state power .  
During these five decades , the faculty of the Chinese People 's University Law School has positively participated in the state 's legislative and judicial building and made positive contributions to the country 's economic construction and social development , particularly to the political structural reform and the building of a democratic legal system .  
One , we must take a stronger mass viewpoint and forge closer party-masses relations : To uphold the mass viewpoint in rural work , it is vital that we uphold the basic aim of serving the peasants with our hearts and minds , uphold the basic criteria of protecting the peasants ' material interests and respecting the peasants ' democratic rights and privileges , and insist on the basic starting point of raising the peasants ' living standard . 
Party committees and leading cadres at various levels should take the initiative in accepting supervision by democratic parties , be glad to have their errors pointed out , and readily accept good advice ; particularly , they should listen to words or advice unpleasant to hear and be tolerant of incisive criticisms ;  
United front cadres at various levels should improve their political , theoretical , and professional qualities in an all-round way and strive to become qualified united front cadres who have a firm stand , a democratic style of work , extensive knowledge , and an innovative spirit and who are well received by friends outside the party .  
As important instruments of the people 's democratic dictatorship , it is the sacred duty of the public security organs to crack down hard on the crimes of criminal and evil forces , ensure the smooth progress of reforms , opening up , and economic construction , and ensure that the masses can live and work in peace .  
An autonomic system for community members featuring democratic election , democratic decision-making , democratic administration , and democratic supervision is gradually being formed in various experimental districts.It is necessary to transform government functions and adjust the core downward .  It is a hard nut to crack for community building , but it is a very important key link .  
We must stick to the principle that both material progress and spiritual progress should be promoted in real earnest , with neither aspect being neglected .  We must earnestly step up spiritual civilization building and democratic legal system building , vigorously develop the advanced culture , and provide the campaign to " build first-rate city " with a powerful spiritual driving force , intellectual support , and legal guarantee .  
He told this reporter : Compiled by Mao Zedong and published in the past , " Selected Works of Mao Zedong " carries Mao 's most representative works written during the period of democratic revolution , and those works have since remained in circulation throughout the world as Mao 's classic works aimed at soundly integrating Marxism with China 's revolutionary realities , and as the most basic works guiding us in learning about and studying Mao Zedong Thought for a long time to come .  
They highly praised the brilliant achievements scored in China under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , and felt elated and inspired by the sustained development of social productive forces , the continuously elevated standards of the people 's material and cultural lives , the gradual advance of the socialist democratic politics , and the excellent situation of national unity , national unification , and social stability .  
They expressed that in the new century they will fully exercise the role of the democratic parties in participating in political affairs , positively participate in the administration and discussion of the state affairs , strengthen democratic supervision , make efforts to offer advice and make suggestions , further intensify their self-construction , and work hard to build the democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce into high-quality parties participating in political affairs and an important mass organization of the united front suited to the requirements of the 21st century .  
Also present at the commemorative meeting were responsible officials of relevant departments of the party , government and army at the central level , representatives of democratic parties and public organizations , journalists in the capital , as well as new and veteran broadcast workers .  
Making continuous efforts to push forward the modernization drive , accomplishing the reunification of the motherland as well as safeguarding world peace , and promoting common development represent our three major historic tasks in the new century .  The tasks are also a joint work and sacred duty for all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation , including personages of the CPC , all democratic parties , federations of industry and commerce , and personages without party affiliation .  
Also attending the meeting were leaders of the central committees of all democratic parties , federations of industry and commerce , leading cadres and personages without party affiliation , personages of ethnic and religious circles living in Beijing , and responsible persons of the units under the united front system .  A total of 300 people attended the party .  
They held that the year 2000 which just passed was a year of landmark significance in the process of development in our country , as the national economy maintained a rather rapid development speed , the building of democratic politics made steady progress , the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system was further improved , and favorable conditions were created for us to comprehensively build our country into comparatively well-off society and speed up the process of socialist modernization in the new century .  
Jiang Zemin said : Practice has proved again and again that giving full play to the positive role of the democratic parties , the federation of industrialists and businessmen , and public figures without party affiliations in the state 's economic , political , and social lives is conducive to strengthening and improving the leadership of the Communist Party , conductive to advancing socialist democratic politics , and conducive to our economic and social development and to our social stability and unity .  
By uniting in endeavor , the compatriots of both sides of the strait will certainly be able to accomplish the great cause of the motherland 's reunification at an early date , and build our common home into a rich and strong , democratic , and civilized modern nation , thus writing a still more resplendent chapter in the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
Since the third plenary session of the 11th party central committee , tremendous achievements that attracted worldwide attention have been scored in China in reform , opening up , and the drive for modernization , the building of democratic legal system and spiritual civilization have been distinctly intensified , the citizens ' awareness in democratic legal system and quality of ideology and morality have been constantly elevated , and gratifying changes have taken place in social ethics and habits .  
Closely integrated with the new , historical conditions , the entire party must conscientiously put into practice the basic strategy of governing the country according to law and governing the country by ethics , always adhere to the principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both , " further attach importance to and step up the building of socialist ethics while continuing to step up the building of democratic legal system .  
The responsible persons of relevant departments under central and state organs ; the responsible persons of the national committees of all democratic parties , as well as the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce ; non-party personages ; and all the representatives attending the national Science and Technology Award-giving rally as well as the representatives of the capital 's scientific and technological circles , totaling more than 3,000 people , attended the report meeting .  
It has been learned that since the Third Session of the Ninth National CPPCC Committee , CPPCC members , all democratic parties and relevant mass organizations have exercised their functions as CPPCC members by raising motions around the major issues cropping up in the course of China 's economic and social development , and the hot-point issues which the people are concerned about .  They have also actively given suggestions and offered plans and raised 3,733 motions , of which 3,372 have been filed for a record after being examined .  
He said that since the Third Session , centering on major issues in China 's economic and social development and hot issues of concern to the masses , the CPPCC members , democratic parties , and relevant popular bodies have exercised their CPPCC functions in the form of raising motions and actively contributed schemes and ideas ; altogether they have raised 3,733 motions , 3,372 of which have been placed on file , and 361 of which have been converted into members ' letters for handling .  
Representatives of central committees of various democratic parties ; All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce , nonparty personages , and China 's five major religions as well as some special committees of the CPPCC have separately held discussion meetings to roundly expose and criticize the cult essence and various crimes of the " Falungong . " They support the government 's crack down on cults in accordance with the law to eliminate public nuisance and engage in firm struggles against the " Falungong " in various ways .  
Let us rally more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , meet the requirements of the important thinking of the " three represents " in an all-round way , enhance our vigor and vitality , forge ahead in a pioneering and enterprising spirit , work in a down-to-earth manner , and exert ourselves in the struggle to achieve the goal of the 10th Five-year Plan and build an affluent , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country !  
Practice has proven that adhering to and perfecting the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the communist party and strengthening the CPC 's close cooperation with all democratic parties and friends from all quarters is of important significance to reinforcing and developing the great solidarity and great alliance , promoting the development of our common cause , and achieving lasting order and stability in the country .  
Firstly , it requires party committees and leading cadres with party membership at all levels to further enhance their ideological understanding , fully recognize the superiority of this basic political system of our country , gain a deep understanding of the distinct features of China 's political party system , study and acquire knowledge of the glorious history of our party cooperating with democratic parties , and enhance their consciousness in cooperating with democratic parties .  
He said : We must work together with Taiwan compatriots to jointly inherit and foster the outstanding Chinese cultural traditions , promote cross-strait exchange in the cultural and other fields , and make continuous efforts to jointly build our homeland into an affluent , strong , democratic , and civilized modern country .  
In its great practice of leading the masses to build up socialist modernizations , from reinforcing and perfecting the system of people 's congress and the system of people 's political consultative conference to introducing democracy of a most extensive scope to the basic level , the party is making constant efforts to strengthen and perfect the country 's socialist democratic system .  
This is a major and effective move which is adopted on the basis of both China 's national conditions and its practical situation , and which aims to speed up the process of socialist democracy .  From the agrarian reform to the introduction of a household-based contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output and from the election of people 's deputies to the introduction of villagers ' self-rule , all have given an expression to the democratic practice that is being carried out by millions upon millions of people under the leadership of the party .  
Zhang Deguang said : Over more than 20 years since the beginning of reform and opening up , the building of a democratic legal system has been strengthened constantly in our country , which has promoted the establishment of a socialist market economic system .  The thinking of governing the country by law has won support from the people .  
At the same time , the CPPCC must also strengthen ties with the party 's discipline inspection organs , state power organs , administrative supervisory organs , and judicial organs , cooperate with supervision by the media and other forms of mass supervision , and work in concert with all sides to promote the active , steady , sound , and effective progress of the CPPCC 's democratic supervision .  
he key to " raising the quality of procuratorial personnel " is to strengthen the development of leading bodies .  Poor-quality , indolent , and problematic leading bodies should be promptly readjusted , while leading procuratorial bodies at the provincial and municipal level should be gradually staffed by democratic party members and nonparty personages .  
The session called on the people of all ethnic groups in the country to rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , uphold the party 's basic line , use the important " three represents " thinking as a guidance , explore ways to advance , do solid work , and strive with one mind to implement the 10th Five-Year Plan and build China into a prosperous , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country !  
Making suggestions on the medium - and long-term plans for national economic and social development is an effective mode of our party 's work in guiding economic construction , and also a concrete embodiment of the party 's system of democratic centralism in making major policy decisions .  
Indeed , people across the country are satisfied with the tremendous achievements made by the current government in developing the economy , improving the people 's livelihood and the democratic legal system , and opposing corruption and promoting clean government .  This is clearly reflected in the high appraisal and warm praise of Premier Zhu 's report expressed by participants in the NPC session and the session of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference .  
Under the guidance of this principle , the Chinese Government has implemented active measures , enhanced democracy at the grass-roots level , comprehensively carried out administration according to law , energetically developed judicial reform , raised the quality of law enforcement personnel , increased the degree of transparency in judicial matters , augmented supervision over law enforcement , severely punished graft and corruption in accordance with law , and achieved a series of positive progressions in completing the democratic legal system .  
The Chief Executive , Mr Tung Chee Hwa , said today ( September 10 , US time ) he has held ' very meaningful and engaging ' discussions on Hong Kong 's future democratic evolution and economic development with key political and business leaders in the US capital .  
These energetic and keen VRAs not only help register eligible voters who may otherwise be left out of the electoral roll for one reason or another .  They are also spreading the message of civic education .  This is the perfect exercise for introducing our young people to the democratic process , and to help them develop a true sense of belonging and commitment to Hong Kong , their home , " she said .  
Officiating at a ceremony to launch the New Territories East District Councils election publicity campaign in Cycle Park , Tai Wai , Mr Lan said , " The coming District Councils election will provide all eligible voters with a golden opportunity to partake in our democratic process by directly electing the candidates of their choice to represent them to deal with many public issues that would have a direct impact on their daily lives . "  
' The method for selecting the Chief Executive shall be specified in the light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress .  The ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures . '  
The method for selecting the Chief Executive shall be specified in the light of the actual situation in the HKSAR and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress .  The ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures .  
They were very happy to have the opportunity to observe the congress in session . They were particularly excited by the revolutionary stand of the Kuomintang in the adopted party platform , pledging itself to remain in the democratic camp , and to unite all the people 's strength from at home and abroad , as well as from behind the enemy lines , for the final victory of national recovery against the Communists .  
Premier Sun informed the participants that in handling " this regrettable affair , " the government has been most concerned , and has carefully followed the rule of protecting the innocent and punishing the guilty . The incident has in no way affected the central administration 's determination to implement democratic and constitutional government .  
The Republic of China is a law-abiding nation and as such does not in any way support or approve of illegal behavior . What must be considered in this case is that it is the autocratic , repressive regime on the mainland that so relentlessly controls all aspects of life , denying the basic human rights that are enjoyed in democratic countries that literally forced the six to use these means to seek their escape .  
From a humanitarian standpoint , it is this earnest desire to lead a life in a free , democratic society that has earned the people 's sympathy . Finally after one year , three months and one week the six patriots finally realized the fulfillment of their long cherished dream - - their sentences were suspended and they were allowed to go to their homeland , the Republic of China .  
Generally , after the rise of a middle class , a society 's expectations of its government are raised , so that the public of an advanced democratic nation is often evenly divided in its satisfaction with government performance , and a seventy or eighty percent satisfaction rate like some of ours is no longer easily attained .  
The late President Chiang Ching-kuo , who boldly strove to promote democratic , constitutional government and march down the road of liberalization , left unfulfilled aspirations behind . At a time when our nation faces dramatic changes in its economic and political situations , how will President Lee fuse the conservative and reform forces , adapt to domestic and foreign trends , and lead the nation along the road to advancement ? The question is not a small one .  
A democratic government has been the goal which China has been long searching for in recent years , but after the Chinese Communists ' abrupt rise , the value of this democratic theory which is applicable everywhere has been muddled and its role confused under the fighting among the political parties of China .  
He proposed that the cabinet selection process should not become a sensitive political question , suggesting instead that it is a question of " political management " and that cabinet changes are a normal state of affairs in advanced democratic countries . From July ninth to the twelfth , committees met to discuss proposals on thought and ideology , the party platform and policies , reform of party affairs , and mainland policy , which concerned the future of party and national politics . The sound of " quicken reform " was heard in every committee .  
On the other hand , however , objective social and economic conditions , the establishment of a democratic model for the populace , and the promotion of rational behavior are especially essential to democracy . As the focus of public attention , members of the Legislative Yuan will undoubtedly have an effect on society and determine whether the ROC succeeds in democratic reforms .  
In order to help pass these bills as early as possible and secure the promotion of constitutional democratic government , Government Information Office Director-General Shaw Yu-ming held a special seminar . Specialists and scholars who had neither a hand in making up the bills nor were already opposed were asked to discuss these bills from a relatively fair , objective angle , in the hopes of raising public awareness and contributing toward a consensus .  
It can not be denied , however , that the development of various aspects of society has brought about a number of problems that have not as yet been completely solved . For example , the adjustment of the adaptability of various government systems has not yet been completed , traditional rules of politics have been subject to strong attack , and the behavior standards of a democratic society have not yet been firmly established , leading to incidents of anomie and disorder .  
If both the government and the people adhere to the established policies of political democratization , economic liberalization , societal pluralization , and cultural sinification ; if they speed the development of democratic politics and maintain stable economic growth ; and if they progress in related social and cultural respects - - all this will mean that all sectors in our nation will develop in a balanced way and forge ahead jointly .  
Fellow Countrymen , Distinguished Guests : Over two thousand years ago , Chinese culture gave birth to the ideal of a great world commonwealth of peace and prosperity . The political , economic , and social systems and goals that it entails are in full accord with those implemented and sought by modern free and democratic nations .  
We sincerely hope that during this generation , we can establish a political model of democratic rule of law , to lay the foundation for a prosperous and equitable economic system and to create a peaceful , happy , trusting , and harmonious society .  
Taiwan is still in a transitional period , moving toward a democratic progressive society . So there are still some awkward phenomena , and not only among civil servants - - the party consciousness of all people is still quite deep . It will take time and a good civil service system to build up the concept and image of administrative neutrality .  
Data indicates that if the mainland authorities launch an attack on Taiwan regardless of internal democratic opposition and the cost in casualties - - one third to one quarter of their combined forces manpower - - then they have three possible options for military action : The first is attacking the islands one by one , starting with Kinmen , Matsu and the Pescadores , at the same time using their air and sea dominance , and missiles , to strike military , political and economic targets on Taiwan itself .  
Elders Also Receive a Baptism in the New Tide : At the end of 1989 , the Kuomintang implemented a party primary system to determine nominees , which fit better with the democratic spirit . The number of seats occupied by women suddenly shot up , with fourteen women among the 101 supplementary legislators ( one of whom has since left to take a cabinet position ) .  
Today Taiwan has become famous around the globe as one of the Four Little Dragons of Asia , while the mainland has shocked the world with the bloody suppression at Tienanmen . China has entered an unprecedented historical period . In a rapidly changing international situation , with close economic and trade ties across the Taiwan Strait , we in Taiwan must squarely face the chaos and disorder appearing in society during a transitional period of democratic constitutional reform .  
In the free democratic societies that have mostly replaced authoritarian societies , the upper level is formed from the middle level and the middle level from the lower level . No one 's position is permanently occupied , and there are no strong authoritarian forces blocking interaction and communication . Mutual understanding is n't difficult .  
Besides a strong legislature , with the development of democratic politics , various interest groups are both " numerous and vocal " with their opinions . For example , there were endless disputes over land acquisition and the proposed routes of transportation projects , which all affected the pace of the projects . This caused the foreign firms who were anxious to get their orders settled to have to wait off to the side chomping at the bit .  
When , in 1989 , the Chinese Communists committed the horrendous atrocity of the Tienanmen massacre in full view of the world 's media , Western governments were finally roused from their dreaming . The last threads of the illusion they had built up concerning the movement of China 's communist authorities towards democracy were broken . In stark contrast , the liberalization and process of political normalization on this side of the Taiwan Strait led the West to begin to accept the ROC as a member of the democratic camp . "  
As society has become democratic and diverse , corruption , which previously few people learned about , is now being spotlighted by the media and legislators . The bidding for the huge contracts of the major construction projects that have followed in the wake of Taiwan 's affluence are said to be fertile ground for illegal linkages of private money and government power . With corruption frequently in the news , popular sentiment has boiled over and the Ministry of Justice is drawing up an anti-corruption plan called " Taking the Knife to Corruption . "  
Although Taiwan practices democratic politics , bureaucratic corruption also exists ; Taiwan 's economy is relatively advanced , but suffers the vital weaknesses of scarce resources and over-reliance on others ; the people of Taiwan have quite a high standard of living , yet there are still classes which rely on welfare payments to make ends meet ; Taiwan has been quite deeply influenced by Western culture , yet still maintains traditional Chinese culture and traditional Confucian thinking , family values and even our ancient culinary culture , all of which spring from a common source .  
The challenge inside the systemPerhaps in Taiwan the democratic climate has not reached maturity , yet the administrative system , originally closed and operating from the top downward , has opened a door to the outside . In the past two or three years , reform groups have been commissioned by the government in some areas , and more and more have begun to be incorporated within the parameters of the system .  
Robert Hum is not worried by this concern . He says : " We are pursuing our interests legally within a democratic system . " But Manying Ip , an influential member of the Chinese community , believes that although the high-profile approach of organizing a party to fight for one 's own right to be heard appears very positive in the short term , a party based mainly on ethnicity has a narrow platform , and she fears that it will not last in the long term .  
Second , Lu Hsiu-lien offered strong personal credentials : a strong academic record , a clean and fresh image , a background as a leader in the women 's movement , and her imprisonment as an early democratic activist back in the early 1980s . She also showed a far-reaching boldness for running the county for " four years and nine months " ( i.e . the nine-month replacement term plus an expected victory in the regular year-end contest ) .  
But in regard to this question , the international community wants the cross-strait problem to be resolved peacefully . Though most countries accept the " one China " principle , and recognize the mainland regime as its representative , Taiwan 's democratic development and economic efforts have drawn great international attention and affirmation . In particular , Taiwan 's stability during the recent financial turmoil in Southeast Asia is evidence that Taiwan plays a critical role in ensuring the economic prosperity and regional security of East Asia .  
A : For a long time now , our government has been plainly telling the Communist Chinese authorities that our final goal is a free , democratic , and prosperous reunified China . But before reunification , the ROC must continue to seek survival and development in international society . This is the basic right of survival of the people living in the Taiwan area . And this can create a model for the Chinese on both sides to pursue a better future way of life and system .  
Another of his major contributions was democratic reforms . In 1987 , martial law was abolished in Taiwan , various bans were lifted , and Taiwanese were for the first time allowed to visit relatives in Mainland China . These new policies firmly set the path toward fundamental democratic reform ; what followed was a praiseworthy " peaceful revolution . "  
In later years , although Taiwan had made tremendous progress relative to its situation 25 years before , the difficulties it faced in raising funds overseas were proportional to those it faced in surviving internationally , and this created more problems for the center . Moreover , domestically , the island was entering the democratic era . Most citizens , including the legislators who held the purse-strings , did n't understand the importance of the center and its contribution to the world . Consequently , the budget was cut repeatedly .  
Wang , who studied in the West for many years , and who says that there is only a single universal standard of press freedom , recalls that when the ROC government first moved to Taiwan , it was facing a life-or-death crisis . Putting the regime 's survival first , it set aside notions of balance and press oversight inherent in democratic politics and argued that the media had to serve the state in order to ensure stability and the public interest .  
ROC president Lee Teng-hui , himself the focus of much media attention , mentioned in his opening address that throughout ten years of promoting democratic reforms , he has always understood the significance of freedom and liberalization of the mass communications industry . It is a constant motivating force for democratic political development . In the future , the ROC will continue to practically implement and fully realize such essential components of civilization as democracy , freedom and human rights , striving in concert with others to achieve the goal of global press freedom .  
Chiu says : " To build a high-quality democracy , the first thing is to create a healthy political party system , and the second is to improve people 's understanding and practice of democratic habits . Unfortunately , Taiwan has not done well in either of these respects . " People who are today over 30 , having grown up under the martial law education system , lack any concept of political checks and balances , are short on the ability to make autonomous judgments , and have poor democratic ethics .  
The narrowing of international space in turn sparked the rise of " nativist ideology " in Taiwan-nascent Taiwanese nationalism . Now that Taiwan is free , democratic , and prosperous , the old policy of refusing to coexist in the international community with mainland China has been abandoned , and the government hopes to create a " win-win " situation . But mainland China still has the mindset from the civil war half a century ago .  
How can people make a wise choice among the many value systems on offer ? How can they monitor their new leader to ensure that Taiwan has a peaceful future free of the influence of " black gold politics " ? These are not only questions for this election , but eternal challenges for the whole people in any democratic society .  
In response to these doubts , Chen Shui-bian stressed that Tang 's achievements in reforming the military during his tenure as minister of national defense were plain for all to see , and his enlightened working style and democratic approach were fully in accord with the principles of inclusive , clean government . Taiwan needed stability in which to pursue reform and progress , develop its economy and assure its national defense capability , and Tang was the best choice to bring this about .  
When Lee Teng-hui took office he successfully promoted democratization , yet only as far as the introduction of direct presidential elections . On the other hand , public order deteriorated , the democratic culture failed to take firm root , and ethnic tensions became exacerbated . Furthermore , the black gold problem grew worse and Taiwan was pushed to the brink of war with the mainland .  
Apart from consolidating democratic achievements , promoting government reforms , and raising economic competitiveness , the new government should , as its foremost objective , closely watch public opinion and implement reforms accordingly , so that the people on this land can live with more dignity , greater self-confidence and a better quality of life .  
At the same time , however , it seems clear that after the first transfer of power between political parties ever to take place in the 55 years since the Republic of China moved its capital to Taiwan , both the ruling and opposition parties are still learning how to play their proper roles . Taiwan 's democratic system will gradually mature amidst the unprecedented political changes taking place today in Taiwan .  
Putting high hopes on this election , four days before the vote President Chen Shui-bian put forward five main principles for his proposed " National Security Alliance " : to agree on national identity , achieve a breakthrough in cross-strait relations , promote democratic reforms , spark economic development , and eliminate social and political cleavages . He had hoped to achieve a consensus on these points between ruling and opposition parties .  
Instead she committed herself to the struggle for freedom , human rights and democracy . After the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident , she supported her husband Chen Shui-bian in embarking on a political career ; a decade later , when Chen was arrested , she won election to the legislature . She later helped her husband to victory in the 2000 presidential elections . Wu had shown an abiding commitment to democratic reform , and had earned a special place in the history of Taiwan 's democratization .  
Right now the Executive Yuan is planning to issue a set of administrative regulations to provide the basis for public referenda of a consultative , non-binding nature . But administrative regulations can not replace proper legislation produced through democratic processes . Although a referendum itself can be seen as the ultimate expression of democracy , unless the law is amended soon , simply taking shortcuts and implementing the administrative regulations could cause anti-nuclear forces to lose the legitimacy that comes from democratic action , which could lead to a constitutional crisis down the road .  
In terms of agreement , both sides realize that although democratic government is essentially " representative government , " duly elected representatives and officials are sometimes unable to carry out fully and impartially the duties entrusted to them by the electorate . To correct the insufficiencies of " indirect democracy " one must thus rely on the " direct democracy " of the popular referendum . This is an important element in the deepening and reform of the democratic process .  
It is just that the popular will is like " flowing water " - it is changeable , now going one way , now another . In today 's Taiwan , where there is still plenty of room for improvement in democratic institutions and where there still exist great differences on the question of national identity , both sides must proceed cautiously . Only in this way will they truly be able to seize the moment and usher in real political reform and a deepening of the democratic process .  
In former times , the emperor had the final say in how urban spaces were organized , and all buildings took the imperial palace as their yardstick . In the democratic era , citizens have formed a close relationship with public spaces , giving them a key role . Public spaces afford people the most immediate aesthetic awareness of their environment . "  
" the goal of this revolution is to further liberate and develop the productive forces , and to turn our underdeveloped socialist country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , culturally advanced and modern socialist country , and that will demonstrate the superiority of socialism in china , " jiang said  
We Colombians , for example , have in just a few years achieved significant political , economic and social changes aimed at developing a new democratic century that is more open , more participatory , more pluralistic , more decentralized and more just .  
We are determined to carry out democratic transformations in our country and to acknowledge and respect philosophical , religious , ideological and political choice as an inalienable right of the individual .  
" Respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in civil , political , economic , social and cultural matters , as well as democratic values exemplified by free and regular elections ;  
As you can see , Tajikistan 's leaders , notwithstanding the enormous pressure of political , social and economic problems , are holding fast to their chosen course of constructing a truly democratic and secular State based on the rule of law .  
It is essential that the parties continue rigourously to observe the rules of the democratic game by unequivocally accepting the outcome of the elections once these have been declared free and fair by the international community . 
The interconnection between the effective functioning of the political system , in a lawful and efficient manner , and the maintenance of human rights is a crucial matter on which the democratic future of El Salvador largely depends .  
The areas of concern included efforts to bring an effective end to public violence and intimidation and to help to create a climate conducive to negotiations leading towards a peaceful transition to a democratic nonracial and united South Africa .  
She stated that , pursuant to article 1 of its Constitution , Romania was a republic and a social and democratic legal State , in which human dignity and the free development of the individual were the guaranteed supreme values .  
The initial process of separating the viable from the nonviable by the councils will have to be undertaken in an open and democratic manner , so that decisions are transparent and are based on objective and professional criteria .  
It strongly urged the international community to continue its moral and material assistance to South Africans in order to help create stable conditions for the rapid and peaceful attainment of a new democratic and nonracial South Africa .  
They express their growing concern over the continued spread of drug trafficking and the enormous danger it poses to social institutions , to the observance of human rights and to democratic stability in their countries .  
A military that has ultimate allegiance to the Constitution and other laws of the land , and to the democratic Government , and is trained in and committed to the principles of human rights and humanitarian law attending legitimate military duties ;  
The internal difficulties experienced by Yemen during the course of the year had been exploited by external forces with the objective of impeding the development of a free , democratic and prosperous society in Yemen .  
The subject was of the utmost importance , for political as well as technical reasons , since the development of a modern transport infrastructure was crucial to the success of the region 's democratic and economic transformation .  
In 1948 , at the end of a civil war in my country which had as its main goal the defence of democratic institutions and the re-establishment of an electoral regime which assured respect for the popular vote , the victors , instead of using arms as a means to stay in power , decided to abolish the armed forces .  
We should not be surprised that freely electing over 2,000 local and national officials in the poorest , least educated , most politically volatile nation in the Western Hemisphere a country without adequate roads , electricity , administrators or democratic tradition should prove to be such a daunting task .  
We should also stress the support of friendly countries directly interested in the region , particularly those that have cooperated , and continue to cooperate , with the Secretary-General in the search for political solutions , and those that have provided technical and financial assistance for the implementation of special programmes of cooperation designed to supplement the peace efforts by attacking the structural causes of our problems and strengthening the democratic process . 
This is equally true in the economic and social sphere , and with regard to the constant modernization and honing of democratic institutions , governance , control of the exercise of political power , full and absolute respect for human rights and the daily exercise of such rights and obligations on the part both of those who govern and of those who are governed .  
But this sharing of experience and this programme of cooperation , as pointed out in the Managua Declaration and the Plan of Action , must transcend the sphere of conceptual criteria and value judgements on the democratic system and freedom , as opposed to totalitarian and authoritarian regimes , of the left or of the right , fundamentalist or religious , or merely the result of military or populist ambitions . 
New democracies virtually everywhere are confronting the common challenge of ensuring the peaceful processes of political transformation , the establishment and consolidation of internal democratic institutions and norms , and structural readjustment accompanied by socially oriented economic transformations backed up by a system of measures and guarantees for social justice in society .  
It is the United Nations which , not limiting itself to those classical human rights born of the American and the French revolutions , consecrated the fundamental rights of the second generation and , in particular , economic , social and cultural rights which allowed it to enrich the contribution of liberalism of the century of enlightenment through the contribution of democratic socialism of the nineteenth century .  
Today I am happy to be able to tell the international community that my country completed instituting its democratic republican institutions in June this year when we organized our multiparty legislative and municipal elections .  
We feel political and economical closeness to the West , and we are aware of the unique historical opportunity to join the prosperous union of democratic European countries .  
Furthermore , Thailand is convinced that one must also ensure that the United Nations of the twenty-first century is more equitable , representative , democratic , transparent and accountable , allowing for the widest possible participation in all its decision-making and activities and serving the interests of all mankind .  When speaking of these qualities , one is inclined to ponder the work on the reform of the Security Council .  
It is thus an important duty of the international community to promote democracy among and within States by helping them to build a democratic system ; by providing them with logistical and technical support for the organization of free elections ; by promoting the creation of a public sector to guarantee the proper management of State affairs ; and by providing the various sectors of civil society with the resources to consolidate the bases of democracy .  
We also need to reinforce the capacity of the United Nations to assist Member States in their efforts to improve democratic structures , including the holding of free and fair elections , the full observance of human rights , the rights of minorities and fundamental freedoms , the strengthening of the rule of law , the fostering of popular participation and accountability of Governments , and the development of a prosperous civil society .  
The difficulties involved in meeting , living together and working as equals in an atmosphere of tolerance and cooperation can not conceal the important contribution being made today by the leaders of that Republic under the inspiring leadership of President Mandela , to whom we wish to accord a special recognition for having constructed the democratic foundations of a multiracial and multicultural nation , fully incorporated into the international community . 
At the very heart of this Programme is the acknowledgement of the inextricable interdependence between the need for transparent , accountable and democratic governance of our society and the imperative of dynamic economic growth and sustainable development .  
We are a nation deeply committed to the proper functioning of democratic institutions , having attained a commendable political stability in our continent 's community of nations .  
In our domestic policy we have had two main priorities : to develop and consolidate the legal and institutional framework of a State of law and the smooth functioning of institutions appropriate to a modern democratic society on the one hand , and , on the other , to ensure economic restructuring and the transition to a market economy .  
However , despite these endeavours and despite my Government 's resolve to secure fundamental freedoms for our people on a firm foundation , foreign interests , for their own unavowed purposes , want to see the democratic process in my country shaped as the saying is in the image and likeness of those alien interests .  
Beyond your qualifications , Mr . President , as Prime Minister , Minister or Head of a democratic party posts that you have occupied or still occupy I am sure it was your standing as an academic , intellectual and man of culture that first and foremost determined that choice .  
The global order can no longer be based solely on the special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the nuclear club , or on economic or military power ; rather , first and foremost , it should be based on the real contribution of individual countries to the prevention of every form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; on their role within global socio-economic development ; on their democratic achievement ; and on their regional importance .  
There are still many obstacles to overcome in the political , economic and social spheres and in the quest of the international community for a more just , equitable , secure , peaceful and democratic world .  
It will never be possible to achieve this peace unless the national policies of the strongest and most powerful countries are promptly transformed into positive action towards democratic consolidation , leading , certainly , to economic globalization , but also to political and social globalization ; ensuring economic growth , but growth with a human and a social face , enabling poor countries to attain the true independence and sovereign equality to which we are all fully entitled .  
We have moved from an authoritarian Central America divided by war to a democratic and united Central America which today is building its future through a regional alliance for sustainable development .  
The Revolutionary Youth Movement to which the youth of Syria belong is an organizational framework and an educational forum for young people through which Syria 's youth exercise their its democratic rights , elect their political leaderships , practice their hobbies and defend their interests at all levels : the educational , social , economic , vocational , cultural , touristic , athletic , artistic , informational , ideological , political and technical .  
Riera Escudero ( Paraguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : The Republic of Paraguay , which has a long history of authoritarian Governments , has enjoyed full civil and political freedoms for more than six years now , as part of a democratic process which , slowly but surely , is being consolidated and strengthened , with the consensus of a noble , peace-loving and hard-working people that makes daily sacrifices in order to build a better future for its children . 
In fact , although the changes that took place in the wake of the cold war led to a certain easing in international relations and promoted , as never before , democratic values , the international situation nevertheless has continued to deteriorate in recent times in the political , economic , social and financial spheres .  
These are some of the reasons that justify a rapprochement between Governments and the national olympic committees , and , moreover , that between the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee , with the objective of achieving democratic societies made up of citizens who are active in their defence of close and lasting human relations .  
Throughout the gradual transition , the summit meetings of the Central American Presidents have institutionalized the process of regional integration and have given concrete form to the commitments undertaken in Esquipulas II , in which Central America pledged to struggle for peace and eradicate war , to ensure that dialogue prevailed over violence and reason over rancour , to give impetus to real democratic processes , and to promote justice and respect for human rights . 
Today we can say that in the 1990s , with the end of the cold war and the breakdown of totalitarianism , an unprecedented opportunity presented itself to change the course of history and , for the first time , to secure the values of a democratic , just , peaceful , civil and reconciled society , with Governments brought to power by the freely expressed will of the people .  
The world community must continue to afford effective assistance to the Central American countries in averting new outbreaks of tension , in ensuring that the processes of national reconciliation in the subregion are irreversible by creating solid democratic bases for State structures , in strengthening the climate of political tolerance , in the strict observance of human rights , and in their economic recovery .  
The representative and participatory democratic model has been enriched , contributing to overcoming substantial political and social tensions characteristic of the establishment of a state of law and the perfecting of democratic institutions , through economic and social harmonization and the constant search for a political consensus . 
On 4 July 1995 , as the culmination of a long period of national debate between the executive and legislative organs of the Government , the political parties and civil society , the reforms approved to the 1987 political Constitution were published through the promulgation of a framework law which for the first time in our history establishes the mechanisms for a real commitment to democratic governability .  
In this respect , it must be emphasized that a solid democratic and pluralistic system , based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the covenants and international conventions on human rights , is closely linked to the implementation of policies aimed at promoting sustainable development , improving the standard of living of the lowest-income segments of society , and promoting civil and political freedoms and equality of opportunities . 
Well-structured , effective , mutually independent and collaborative State institutions , an equitable political system , a harmonized legal system , overall security and economic prosperity all form the basis of a democratic State .  
As one of the 14 founder members , India looks forward to participating in all its activities , aimed at promoting and advancing democracy , improving and consolidating electoral processes , strengthening and supporting national capacity to develop the full range of democratic instruments , and promoting transparency and accountability in the context of democratic development .  
Pluralism is essential to the transition to a democratic government , but in a larger sense encompassing periodic elections , the accountability of public officials , a transparent public administration , an independent judiciary and a free press .  
Fifthly , sharing democratic values is of crucial importance for the political , economic and social processes in national societies , as well as for international peace and security .  
The national euphoria resulting from the overthrow of a tyrannic dictatorship or from a deliberate choice , through legal processes , to change a form of government is , in most cases , as we have observed in the last few years , soon dissipated by a realization that making a democracy work is not as easy as proclaiming a democratic Government .  
But the rather widespread expression of a sincere desire to make the Security Council more effective , more transparent , more legitimate and more democratic are coming up against the fact that this exercise brings together States which are pursuing contradictory perhaps even irreconcilable goals .  
In the economic sphere , the implementation of the emergency and national reconstruction programme has given way to the creation of medium - and long-term programmes aimed at promoting wide democratic participation and eradicating the structural causes of the conflict , mainly social inequalities and extreme poverty .  
Indonesia , along with the other non-aligned countries , has consistently emphasized that if the United Nations is to become a fully effective central instrument in a new and revitalized international order , reflecting the new realities of the international situation , it should be based on and truly reflect the democratic spirit of equality , equity and transparency , in representation as well as in the decision-making processes .  
Only when the United Nations has a representative , democratic and transparent Security Council that maintains the proper relationship with the General Assembly and that makes correct use of the powers entrusted to it by Member States will we have a truly effective Security Council ; only then will the United Nations be able to meet the demands and challenges of the future .  
Although there may still be many difficulties and challenges along the road ahead , we are confident that , through several generations of hard work , our people will lift China out of economic and cultural backwardness and turn it into a highly prosperous and democratic modern country .  
The New Partnerships Initiative ( NPI ) announced by the Vice-President at the Social Summit emphasizes work at the local level to build sustainable institutional capacity in three areas non-governmental organization empowerment across sectors , small - business partnerships and democratic local governance as well as efforts at the national level to ensure a supportive policy , regulatory and resource environment for private and community action .  
Mindful of the acuteness of the problem , which has taken on global dimensions and which could call into question the democratic achievements of this decade , the international community , at these major conferences over the last five years , has tried to find a collective and global response that would emphasize an integrated development approach , reflecting its multidimensional aspects .  
Thus , from the outset , CARICOM States have attached the highest importance to achieving the basic goals of the international community , which are reaffirmed in the resolution before us ; in particular , restoration of democratic order in Haiti , including the full observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and the promotion of economic and social development .  
In this context , the continued support of the United Nations system and the international community , which is recognized in this draft resolution , will be critical in providing the people of Haiti with a second chance to secure a democratic future , in which their political and development aspirations can be fulfilled .  
In this regard , it is essential for African countries themselves to promote sustainable development and greater political stability through , inter alia , State structures adapted to the new realities , the establishment of democratic political systems , a responsible and transparent management of public affairs , and respect and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
An end to military rivalry , foreign occupation and feelings of racial superiority would be conducive to a world free of poverty and injustice , in which relationships would become more democratic , humane and stable .  
Conditions must be created for the holding of free , fair and direct elections , in accordance with the highest democratic standards and respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and for the rights of all ethnic and religious groups .  
Furthermore , the exercise of such rights was not possible in the absence of political freedom , and their protection required States to adopt democratic practices , practices which must inevitably bring benefits since people who were free to think , exchange ideas and invest their own energies and capital would be able to contribute more to economic and social development than people stunted by repression .  
Algeria was aware that the promotion and protection of human rights and democratic principles were primarily the responsibility of Governments , and it assigned a prominent place to those rights and principles in its project for the construction of a modern State based on republican principles and on the alternation of political power .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism and criminal acts , as well as illegal drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
A number of areas of common interest and joint action in human rights were identified , including the question of minorities , preventive action , fact-finding missions , seminars and training , advisory services and technical assistance , particularly with respect to constitutional and legal reform , democratic elections , the administration of justice and the strengthening of infrastructures for the promotion and protection of human rights .  
Now , 20 years later , almost 40 per cent of the territory of Cyprus , a sovereign , independent , democratic State and a Member of the United Nations , remained under occupation , and gross and massive violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms continued to be committed there .  
Noting with satisfaction the holding of free and democratic elections in El Salvador , the progress made towards fulfilment of the outstanding commitments assumed under the Peace Agreement , the political will consistently expressed by the signatories thereto and the support of the various Salvadorian political forces for accelerating the resolution of crucial outstanding issues , which is essential to promote reconciliation and maintain and consolidate peace in El Salvador ,  
We are now in the process of developing permanent mechanisms for preventive diplomacy and collective security based on a regional commitment to a system of shared democratic values .  
The informal cooperation that now exists on security issues in the region and the conclusion of more formal economic cooperation arrangements have contributed significantly towards building confidence in the prospect of a more secure , democratic and prosperous future for southern Africa .  
Implement at the national level structural adjustment policies , which should include social development goals , and effective development strategies that establish a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resource development and further promote the development of democratic institutions ;  
It requires democratic institutions , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , increased and equal economic opportunities , the rule of law , promotion of respect for cultural diversity and rights of persons belonging to minorities and an active involvement of the civil society .  
Such an inclusive society must be based upon respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice and special needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , democratic participation and the rule of law .  
Although the democratic Government had been elected by a sizable majority , opposition forces had controlled the Senate because it included nine senators appointed by the outgoing military regime .  
The successful peaceful transition of South Africa to a democratic and non-racial society with human rights safeguarded by an entrenched Charter of Fundamental Rights has nevertheless left cultural , economic and social inequalities reflecting historical deprivation .  
The senior officials of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Russia and Uzbekistan , supporting the efforts of the leadership of Tajikistan to carry out democratic reforms , stressed the special importance in that connection of the forthcoming parliamentary elections and the need for them to be held in accordance with democratic norms , on a multiparty basis , and to ensure the widest possible participation of the various political forces .  
My Government wishes to reaffirm that the Lusaka Protocol signals the beginning of a decisive step towards the definitive solution to the Angolan internal conflict , by establishing a unique opportunity for eliminating completely the threat of renewed war .  At the same time , it has paved the way for the normal functioning of the democratic institutions that emerged from the multi-party elections , which both the United Nations and the international community declared to be free and fair .  
The brother African country of Angola , long the victim of an unrelenting civil war and of enormously lethal events , has just provided eloquent proof that it is always possible to reconcile warring brothers who want to bury the hatchet the better to work together to build a peaceful , democratic and prosperous nation .  
Mrs . BEZLEPKINA ( Russian Federation ) said that during the period of reorientation resulting from Russia 's adoption of democratic values and ideals the country 's internal resources were strained and its people were struggling with a falling standard of living .  The transition to a market economy was being hampered by social and psychological inertia .  
In order to reverse this trend , the country must satisfy one major condition , a political condition : it must conduct free , transparent and democratic elections and take subsequent measures to establish a constitutional State .  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
They also shared the view that steps could be taken to facilitate the early conclusion of negotiations on complex substantive issues that are yet to be considered , namely " economic and social issues and the agrarian situation " , " strengthening of civilian power and role of the army in a democratic society " and " constitutional reforms and electoral regime " .  
The revised timetable provides for completion of two main substantive issues ( economic and social issues and the agrarian situation ; and strengthening of civilian power and role of the army in a democratic society ) before the electoral campaign is fully under way .  
A noteworthy example of the effective facilitative role by UNDP is that played in support of the democratic transition process , which extended to providing the Government , political parties and pressure groups as well as donors with a neutral forum for dialogue .  
A society for all is seen as an inclusive society which must be based upon respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice , democratic participation and the rule of law .  
Together with the constitutional and legislative reforms established by the peace agreements , the creation of a new and efficient system for the administration of justice calls for the programming and implementation of measures to modernize and raise the professional standards of the judiciary , which , in keeping with the new democratic legality that supports it , would make it possible for new judicial practices to become firmly entrenched . 
Economic and social development , democratic consolidation and the promotion and protection of human rights all require a strong , rational and predictable legal system for their effective implementation .  
In many Latin American countries , the paradox of overabundant legislation and overemphasized democracy contrasting with the fragmentation of society , deep economic inequalities and the low level of political participation suggests that the ruling \ x { 5e68 } ite is attempting to overcome the weak integration of society by developing the legal framework of a democratic state of law addressing the whole people .  
Its main functions include : ( a ) processing the dissemination of human rights as an effective means of guaranteeing their observance and consolidating the democratic system , ( b ) cooperating with relevant institutions to promote the teaching of human rights at the primary , secondary and university levels and in non-formal education and ( c ) promoting the alignment of domestic legislation with international agreements and treaties on human rights .  
The Code , reaffirming the continuing validity of the comprehensive concept of security , set politically binding norms and principles guiding the role of armed forces in democratic societies and the relation , among States as well as the relations of States vis - - vis their nationals in the military field .  
On the other hand , the memorandum of understanding confirmed the principle of respect for and defence of the democratic model contained in the Constitution , obliging each to recognize the popular will expressed through universal suffrage as the sole and exclusive way to maintain and obtain political power . 
This action by the international community , showing itself to be unequivocally in favour of democratic law in Sao Tome and Principe and of scrupulous respect for democratically elected sovereign organs , represented not only an invaluable contribution to the positive conclusion of the crisis in Sao Tome and Principe , but also en example to be followed in all similar instances in any part of the world .  
Croatia 's views stem from its geo-strategic position and its political , economic , technological and cultural features , and are thus closely linked to its long-term strategic interests , including a political settlement to the crisis in the region as a precondition for democratic and independent development .  
NULLIn its resolution 1995 / 52 of 3 March 1995 on the situation of human rights in Togo , the Commission , inter alia , welcomed the fact that Togo had set out on the road to democratic political change , and urged all Togolese to respect the outcome of the parliamentary elections held in February 1994 and to ensure the effective functioning of the democratically elected parliament .  
What remains , as the Central American Presidents declared during their sixteenth summit meeting , held at Cerro Verde , El Salvador , from 29 to 31 March 1995 , is " the urgent need to strengthen the peace processes in Central America and thus to guarantee the stability and security which are essential to consolidation of the democratic order and the economic and social development of our peoples " ( A / 49 / 901-S / 1995 / 396 , annex I ) .  
That the social situation has not seriously endangered the democratic process is due , in part , to the strong tradition of organization and social discipline of the Nicaraguan people , reinforced by the fact that the Nicaraguan poor , especially small and mid-scale agricultural producers ( who sow 75 per cent of the country 's cultivated area ) , possess a large volume of productive resources .  
In this context , the peace agreements set forth specific commitments whose purpose was ( a ) to establish the specific requirements for ending the armed conflict ; ( b ) to tackle some of the root causes of the conflict by starting from democratic principles ; and ( c ) to place special emphasis on the process of reconstruction as part of the economic and social development of the country .  
In other words , the prospects for lasting peace in El Salvador will call for sustained expansion of its economy based on a new model , expansion which is stimulated by a modern State apparatus guaranteeing fairness of distribution and presupposing all of the transformations wrought through the new democratic institutions .  
Technical and financial cooperation is still needed from the international community , however , failing which there is little likelihood of consolidation of economic growth , reconstruction , improved living conditions for the poorest sectors of the population , peace , democracy and the functioning of democratic institutions .  
In this context , it is worth mentioning that the changes taking place in Cuban society , principally in the economic sector , are creating a more conducive framework enabling the incipient movement of non-governmental organizations to reform Cuban civil society and to call for democratic rules in relations between society and the political authorities .  
Access for all to the values , knowledge and skills imparted by the educational system is a prerequisite for ensuring the continuity and stability of democratic institutions , guaranteeing political , economic , social and cultural participation , especially on the part of the most disadvantaged groups and contributing to the fight against poverty .  
In the strong belief that concrete , broad strategies must be developed and applied to fight corruption , we reiterate our commitment to adopt cooperation mechanisms to combat that criminal activity because it weakens the democratic system , undermines the prestige of its institutions and constitutes an agent of social disintegration and distortion of the economic system .  
Its closing consensus statement emphasized that media scrutiny of the exercise of political power was essential in a democratic society ; that all media laws should conform to international and constitutional standards ; and that journalists themselves have a duty to work to the highest professional standards .  
At a time when the transitional Government was endeavouring to improve the country 's listless and unstructured economy and to prepare for presidential and parliamentary elections , the international community should do all it could to mobilize support for a pluralistic and democratic Zaire .  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
According to Mr . Turneb Delp , spokesman for the Front national pour le changement et la d \ x { 5e66 } ocratie , the elections could not be free and democratic since the Provisional Electoral Council was composed mostly of members who were close supporters of President Aristide or of the parties making up the presidential coalition , and the elections were marred by massive fraud . 
Urges all the Afghan parties to work with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
Welcomes the satisfactory evolution of the political process in Haiti and the holding of legislative and municipal elections and the forthcoming presidential elections , in accordance with the Constitution , as indispensable elements in the strengthening of democratic institutions ;  
also the intensive efforts by the Government of Nicaragua to promote a sustained economic recovery and the considerable progress made in securing a broad social consensus by means of a process of national dialogue for the adoption of measures to lay the foundations for reconstruction and economic and social development , through a comprehensive transition process that will be further consolidated through the holding of free and democratic elections , which will take place at the end of 1996 ,

included harmony among the various national groups and political stability based on the equal rights of all citizens , the unity of its multinational people and the resolution of all State issues through peaceful , democratic means .  
the light of his findings , the Special Rapporteur puts forward a number of recommendations ranging from the consolidation of democratic institutions and the reform of the judicial system to the establishment of a national police force accepted by both communities and the deployment of human rights observers .  
One reform is the law on the integrated governmental administration and control system , whose main objectives are to develop and strengthen a State based on law and a democratic regime , to guarantee the efficiency and the effectiveness of the public sector , to eliminate the conditions of impunity that foster administrative corruption , and to integrate the external auditing system for the public sector with the internal control systems of its components .  
When we achieved our independence in 1957 , the fundamental challenge to leadership , including the nascent Malaysian civil service , was to serve a multiracial , multireligious , democratic , developing country whose economy was commodities-dependent and whose security was threatened by a communist insurgency . 
The purpose of the process is to create an administration that can carry forward the implementation of democratic social and economic reforms ; an administration capable of utilizing all past experiences and of consistently and dynamically creating conditions for the well-balanced development of the country ; and , finally , an administration that will ensure that the burden of reforms is evenly distributed , that will care about improving the living standards of Polish families , and that will work to ensure that citizens can live in peace , free from the fear of crime and economic abuse .  
In a democratic country , public administration which is effective and enlightened because it is refocused on its essential tasks can contribute powerfully to a country 's economic development not only by coordinating the efforts of public and private enterprise , but also by attracting worthwhile investment .  
We proceeded to achieve this with a special focus on India 's needs , and our Constitution set forth the institutional bases for resilient administrative processes , especially in the crucial areas of legal , judicial , parliamentary and democratic structures .  
Untiring efforts have also been made in the promotion of human rights , particularly in respect of information , democratic participation and the administrative and legal functions of democratic institutions guaranteeing the civil and political rights of the population , including documentation , the local administration of justice and civic education .  
At the same time , in operative paragraph 1 of the draft resolution , the General Assembly welcomes the recommendation contained in the Secretary-General 's report to renew the mandate of the joint participation of the United Nations with the Organization of American States in the International Civilian Mission to Haiti , with the task of verifying full observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in order to establish a climate of freedom and tolerance propitious to the consolidation of democratic institutions .  
The consolidation of democratic Governments , growing respect for human rights and economic and social progress are a tangible reality in and a stimulus for the future of Latin America , a continent to which Spain is linked by solid historical ties of mutual friendship and confidence .  
The Government of Bolivia 's current efforts are essentially based on the consolidation of participatory democratic institutions and on the conviction that economic development must be compatible with care for nature and the environment in other words , that this must take place within the framework of sustainable development and of respect for ethnic and cultural diversity , in order to make unity in diversity possible .  
I know that all members have been following with interest , and are well informed about , the deep-seated qualitative changes in the political life of Benin and I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank everyone for the genuine interest with which they have followed our major political event : the recent presidential election in March 1996 , in which we could see a peaceful and orderly democratic transfer of power , without violence or bloodshed , which was totally in keeping with the rule of constitutional law in force since December 1990 .  
The generally correct and normal conduct of the ballot , the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of our political classes , the courageous and responsible attitude of the people of Benin and the unwavering stance taken continually by the Constitutional Court are all signs which demonstrate genuine political maturity and an irrevocable commitment to building a truly democratic society in the Republic of Benin .  
We urge the international community to remain committed to the cause of Bosnia and Herzegovina ; to remain vigilant as regards any ill intention against the independence and territorial integrity of that country ; to ensure the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes ; to seek the arrest and extradition to The Hague of indicted war criminals ; to prevent any negative outside interference that could potentially impede the process of peaceful and democratic reintegration ; and to make available the assistance pledged for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bosnia .  
In this vision , the present weakness of our political systems can be regarded as a phase in the democratic transition to a modern developed Africa only if the international community fully realizes that democracy can not prosper in poor countries , where politics were for so long the road to social success , without exposing our citizens to the political games of those for whom the advent of democracy and its attendant competitive elections mean the end of the eminent position they enjoy in society thanks to the exercise of political power .  
Nevertheless , just as we understand that the world has changed , that there is a new international agenda governed by the common concerns of all peoples over environment preservation , population growth , respect for human rights , strengthening of democratic systems , recognition of women 's rights , and the social and economic development of nations , we also understand that this Organization must be renewed and readapted to the new world circumstances . 
The fundamental difficulties which faced our nation in its previous efforts at building a viable democracy are being progressively addressed , taking into account the objective realities of our national situation , so as to ensure an orderly transition and the establishment of durable democratic structures of governance at all levels in our country .  
Despite this difficult situation , Zaire has made it a point of honour to pursue its democratic process , committing itself to reestablishing the authority of the State , rebuilding the basic infrastructure , improving the country 's economic , financial and monetary situation , ensuring the security of persons and property and observing human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It is a human , social , political and economic imperative for the international community and for all the actors and partners in development , in their own specific actions , to work responsibly for a more just and equitable framework for international trade , favouring a free and democratic economic partnership .  
The core objectives of the programme were , inter alia , to create and adjust the country 's macroeconomic policy , ensure a correct legal and regulatory framework for the development of a strong market economy , provide a transparent and accountable policy framework aimed at promoting investment , allocate adequate budgetary resources for social programmes , create the necessary conditions for the establishment and consolidation of democratic institutions and support good governance and political stability .  
The fashion for what is commonly called democracy is sweeping the surface of the earth , and one of the principal criteria which the developed countries democracy 's self-appointed guarantors use for deciding eligibility for development assistance is the establishment of a democratic system .  Should n't that respectable institution , democracy , be manifest within the Organization itself when it elects a competent and honest leader in whom to duly vest its authority ?  
It is already clear today that the conflict imposed on the Tajik people an enormous human tragedy was aimed at undermining the newly emerging foundations of the State and interfering with economic growth and market reforms and hence the country 's independent development along a general democratic course .  
The stabilization of Tajikistan 's economy is not only the key to satisfying the pressing social and economic needs of our people , but would without a doubt promote the process of national conciliation , social consolidation , and the strong and healthy formation of democratic institutions in the country as a whole .  
Firmly and consistently committed to the course of democratic development pursued by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan , Mr . Emomali Rakhmonov , the Government of my country promotes the involvement of the broad mass of the population in social , political and economic reform processes through such mechanisms as referendums , national elections to representative bodies , renovation of the judicial system and every possible encouragement of openness .  
The United Nations was born out of a yearning for a democratic multilateral system capable of addressing problems brought about by hideous tensions and conflicts throughout the world , with a view to making planet Earth a more secure , just and friendly place for present and future generations .  
Yet , strengthened by his popular legitimacy and the support of a broad majority of the people of the Comoros , in six months President Taki drafted the broad outlines of political , economic and social reforms to overcome the numerous obstacles impeding the construction of a democratic , prosperous and interdependent society in the Comoros .  
There is no doubt that the more representative the United Nations is , the more democratic it will be ; and that the more accountable the United Nations is , the more effective it will be , thus benefitting us all , small or large , weak or powerful , rich or poor .  
Moreover , my Government has pledged itself to respect the fundamental rights of all citizens as well as to other elements of civil society , such as a free press , freedom of expression , a fair and open democratic process , the supremacy under God of our Constitution and the effective functioning of the parliamentary system , for which our Constitution specifically and explicitly provides . 
It is rather incongruous that the same forces that are at the forefront of the effort to establish democratic institutions and representative governments in certain parts of the world are also engaged in an enterprise which , if successful , is calculated to destroy the free and democratic way of life in the eastern Caribbean .  
Society must be firmly rooted in the rule of law , democratic participation , gender equality , the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all , social justice , tolerance , respect for ethnic , religious and cultural diversity , and meeting the requirements of groups with specific needs , such as young and older people , as well as people with disabilities .  
We must foster and strengthen democratic participation in the political sphere to develop , through a sharing of responsibility between the State , local government and civil society , a model of unified efforts for social development .  
A world free of colonialism , foreign occupation and aggression , and protected from the threat of racial hegemony , expansionism or colonization is the necessary precursor of a world free of poverty , injustice and oppression , in which relations are more democratic , humane , secure and stable for the well-being of one and all .  
That positive development the end of the cold war also encouraged many in the developing world , especially those of us in Africa , to undertake far-reaching political and economic reform measures , with a view to laying the foundation for democratic transformation and meaningful economic growth and development .  
Success in reforms , promotion of the private sector and direct foreign investment , increased activity in the democratic process and the strengthening of civilian society are essential elements of an Agenda for Development , and to a large extent depend on the support of the international community , in terms of resources and political will .  
We have respectfully included the question of democracy in this debate because we do not think that any sustainable economic recovery is viable without a pluralistic and representative institutional framework or clear respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  The incremental measures contained in the Helms-Burton Act do not contribute to democratic transition in Cuba , nor do they make any real contribution to opening up the economy .  
Despite the importance of bilateral relations and successful regional organizations , the United Nations remains the principal mechanism capable of ensuring the transition from a bipolar and confrontational world to a multipolar and democratic one . 
Even though it is important to reaffirm a strong commitment of the private sector , donor Governments , agencies and non-governmental organizations to genuine partnership for the accelerated industrial growth of Africa , a critical step must be made to design policies based on the real needs of individual African economies , as development will take place in Africa only when its peoples have democratic control over their own policies .  
Among other things , a number of examples are given of the assistance provided by the United Nations system for political parties or movements , the mobilization of civil society , electoral assistance , communications media to enable them to act freely and independently , creating a political culture through observance and monitoring of human rights , improved accountability , support for transparency and quality of public sector management , democratic government structures , and strengthening the rule of law . 
The Assembly will agree with me that the generally proper and legitimate election , the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of the national political class , the courageous and responsible attitude of the people of Benin and the unwavering rigour of the Constitutional Court are telling signs of genuine political maturity and an irreversible commitment to building a truly democratic society in the Republic of Benin .  
South Africa 's recent experience since its first truly democratic elections just over two years ago has indicated that the benefits of a vibrant democracy at both the national and the local levels with the full participation of all political parties , movements and civil society has again proven the value of the necessity for all Member States to strive for and promote a political culture of full participation and consultation in the affairs of state .  
Therefore , in this initial period of democratic reform , international support and assurances are of crucial importance in alleviating or offsetting the negative economic and social consequences which economic reform and structural adjustment programmes usually entail .  
The international community should therefore lend , as before , moral and methodological support , as well as economic , financial and other assistance which would allow the Governments of new or restored democracies to proceed with bold steps to create a thriving market economy and a democratic system and to alleviate the social costs sustained in the process .

Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
Calls upon the Government of Guatemala , URNG and Guatemalan society as a whole to make every possible effort to familiarize the Guatemalan people with the content of the Peace agreements as quickly as possible , to ensure the full participation of the people in building the new multi _ ethnic , multicultural and plurilingual nation , establishing a democratic society with social justice , initiating a period of sustained and sustainable economic and social development and ensuring the pre _ eminence of civilian authority in national decision _ making ;  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other updated information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
Against this background it is easy to understand the huge significance of the study completed by Mrs . Nicole Questiaux in 1982 , [ 1 ] which determined the conditions and requirements on which the legality of a state of emergency depended and which ensured that proper application thereof is compatible with respect for human rights and with democratic forms of government .  
In short , according to the criteria laid down by the Inter _ American Court , the sole valid justification for states of emergency is the defence of the democratic system , which is understood as a system that affords absolute protection to the constant maintenance of certain essential rights of the human person .  
The most valuable lesson that can be drawn from the practice of the international monitoring bodies and from the Special Rapporteur 's own experience is the certainty that , to the extent that the norms and principles governing the state of emergency are respected , its impact on the functioning of the institutions , the validity of the rule of law and the enjoyment of human rights will necessarily be limited and compatible with a democratic system of government .  
The professionalism of the role the army now plays in national life was made clear by its comportment during the electoral process of March 1997 : in marked contrast to the record of military interference in the history of El Salvador , the army demonstrated its respect for the democratic decision of the Salvadorian people that those elections represented .  8 .  Before the signing of the peace agreements , public security functions were carried out by bodies dependent on the armed forces .  
However , although the National Civil Police is a professional public security body with the potential to execute modern and democratic public security policies , the model established by the peace accords has not been consolidated without the occurrence of distortions .  
UNDP , working in close collaboration with ONUSAL , MINUSAL and ONUV and in consultation with the beneficiary organizations , formulated and implemented priority technical assistance programmes in the areas of : administration of justice , public security , reintegration of former combatants and demobilized soldiers , the Fund for the Protection of the Wounded and War-Disabled , the protection of human rights through institutional support of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights , and democratic participation .  
If , as a last resort , States consider themselves compelled to undertake proceedings of expropriation or compulsory acquisition , such action shall be : ( a ) determined and envisaged by law and norms regarding forced eviction , insofar as these are consistent with internationally recognized human rights ; ( b ) solely for the purpose of protecting the general welfare in a democratic society ; ( c ) reasonable and proportional ; and ( d ) in accordance with the present Guidelines .  
With regard to Haiti , the establishment and training of a professional civilian police force will be a fundamental factor in maintaining peace and security and in ensuring the real and effective functioning of democratic institutions , the rule of law and full respect for human rights .  
The international community must continue to provide technical , economic and financial assistance to support political stability , balanced development , the establishment of democratic institutions and respect for human rights .  
It also requires a fair legal system , efficient democratic institutions , popular participation and the promotion of sustainable economic development as preconditions for social stability .  
The individual elements of a culture of peace are therefore : non-violence and respect for human rights , respect and solidarity among all peoples and dialogue between cultures , the linkage of peace to democratic participation and sustainable human development , the free flow and sharing of information and knowledge , contribution to conflict-prevention and post-conflict peace-building , and equality between women and men , all best supported through projects in which people take an active role in transforming their values , attitudes and behaviours .  
Even in situations where it may be necessary to impose limitations on such a right , full compliance with article 4 of the Covenant is required so that any limitations imposed must be determined by law only insofar as this may be compatible with the nature of these [ i.e . economic , social and cultural ] rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
We are convinced that a renewed effort to promote complete , integrated and democracy-based education in Latin America and the Caribbean in a context of growing interdependence , technological development and globalization will help strengthen democratic civic culture on the basis of the full and effective enjoyment of human rights .  
It also invited all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardized the friendly relations among States , hindered development of international cooperation and resulted in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society .  
With a view to promoting peace and strengthening security in the Mediterranean region , the new Government of Malta has time and time again committed itself to a foreign policy that is based on the values of democratic governance , on the upholding of fundamental human rights , on the peaceful settlement of disputes and on a policy that is in favour of disarmament and strongly opposes military aggression , and the manufacture , distribution and proliferation of all types of armaments and weapons , especially weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological .  
Pursuant to the peace agreements , priorities have been set and various projects formulated with the aim of : ( a ) achieving the economic and social reintegration of former combatants and demobilized members of the armed forces ; ( b ) attending to the economic and social needs of the communities most affected by the conflict and improving the living conditions of the poorest groups ; ( c ) consolidating democratic institutions ; and ( d ) promoting legal and constitutional reform .  
However , on a number of occasions the response fell short of the amount required to complete other programmes .  The main projects that still require funding include those on democratic institutions and productive and social reintegration .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
Those countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies that take into account social development goals , as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
The Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the General Secretary of NLD in her compound .  
Genuine and substantive discussions should take place without further delay between the present military regime and the leaders of NLD and with other political leaders who were duly elected in the democratic elections of 1990 , including representatives of ethnic minorities .  Certain steps reportedly taken in July by SLORC , apparently to initiate such discussions , are a welcome and positive development , but that development must be intensified .  
The Security Council reiterates the importance of a political settlement and national reconciliation and calls upon the parties to cooperate with the International Mediation Committee chaired by the President of Gabon and with the Joint United Nations / Organization of African Unity Special Envoy in reaching rapid agreement on peaceful transitional arrangements leading to the holding of democratic and free and fair elections with the participation of all parties .  
If , by a democratic regime , we mean one in which human rights are respected , power is vested in the Government by the people through free elections , there is a separation of powers , the law is enforced by the authorities , there is equality under the law , the armed forces and police are at the service of everyone , the courts perform their functions independently , political parties express themselves freely , and there is freedom of the press , then this report shows that none of these conditions are being met .  
The new State structure , based on an omnipresent state party ( although this is denied ) , the absence of a short - , medium - or long-term democratic project , and the fact that there is nobody capable of controlling the exercise of power all lead the Special Rapporteur to conclude that the Congolese people do not enjoy , and will not enjoy in the foreseeable future , the human right to democracy .  
We must pay special , sustained attention to the proliferation of light weapons and small arms , which not only threaten the security and stability of African States , but are major obstacles to the building and consolidation of the democratic process , without which no economic and social development is conceivable on our continent . 
They declared themselves in favour of a new and more democratic world order based on the strengthening of collective security and the development of cooperation in the political , economic , social and environmental spheres and in the defence of human rights .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Finally , all States of the region are invited to address , through various forms of cooperation , terrorism , international crime and illicit drug production and trafficking , as factors jeopardizing friendly relations between States , hindering the development of international cooperation , and , above all , resulting in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
They also expressed their support for a new , more democratic and just world order , and noted the growing geopolitical and economic importance of the countries represented at the meeting in contemporary international relations .  
The quality of teaching and the modern technological infrastructure of education , including computers and access to the Internet , must be developed in schools , particularly in the poorest countries and neighbourhoods , with the help of government programmes , voluntary fund-raising and international assistance .  57 .  An educated citizenry is a precondition for fully effective democratic institutions .  
Continued support from a robust and credible NATO-led military force will not least be crucial to a successful completion of IPTF 's efforts to restructure , retrain and reform the local police and judicial system in Bosnia in order to help them handle public security in a manner which is professionally sound , democratic and observant of human and minority rights .  
At a time when the precarious nature of the political , social and economic climate is exerting increasing pressure on the foundations of the key institutions on which respect for the rule of law depend , it is more necessary than ever that the international community continue and step up its assistance , and contribute , by its presence , to consolidating democratic institutions in Haiti . 
In this transitional stage , lasting only six months , the late Mr . Ghafoorzai intended and was steadfast in his determination to convene the grand national decision-making assembly and the formation of a broad-based inclusive government based on a democratic constitution .  
The Dominican Republic attaches special importance to the ongoing reform process , given that it is capable , while respecting the principles and purposes that gave birth to the Organization , of ensuring a more democratic , transparent , representative and efficient system capable of facing the current challenges , especially those of peace and the problems of poverty that affect the peoples of the world .  
In the current post-transition phase , the results achieved in the democratic processes and economic reform , which have been recognized by the international community and financial institutions , qualify Romania legitimately to play a clearer and more active role in defining and designing common projects of security and progress in the region and in the world , including within the United Nations and its specialized agencies .  
By building peace , reducing unsustainable military expenditures , promoting equitable and sustainable development and encouraging stable , democratic societies which respect human rights , we not only limit human suffering , but we also address the root causes of conflict itself .  
Albania has a peculiar history of chronic isolation , of almost total estrangement from the rest of the world , of great potential , human and natural wealth , while being , at the same time , underdeveloped and poor .  Our difficulties of growth are directly linked to the legacies of former rules and half a century of communism , of non-existent , non-functioning or malfunctioning democratic institutions , both during and after the collapse of communism and its structures , as well as with our mentality .  
We appeal to this global Organization , to European organizations and structures , to those who made a major contribution to ending the war in Bosnia through the Dayton accords and to all those who have the power and the political will to continue to exert the necessary pressure to direct this major pending issue in the Balkans onto the path of negotiation , with proper international mediation , with a view to a just , peaceful and democratic solution acceptable to all .  
The most important of these include the rapid reconstruction of the social and economic infrastructure that had been destroyed ; the return of refugees to their homes , together with their social and psychological adjustment and reintegration into the new conditions of life ; the active involvement of citizens in economic activity through the creation of jobs , which are crucial ; and , above all , the creation of conditions conducive to the democratic development of Tajik society .  
In the debate at this session on proposals for reforming the United Nations , I would like , at the outset , to state that the strategic objective of all of the reforms envisaged must be to provide better conditions for the proper functioning of the Organization so that it can fulfil its founders ' dream of a lasting , democratic , responsible and credible Organization .  
But to achieve the more democratic , efficient and dynamic United Nations we are dreaming of , it is essential that the reforms reach the heart of one of its principal organs : the Security Council must stop being a bunker impenetrable to the General Assembly 's demands for an equitable and fair expansion .  
Here , and with specific reference to reform of the Security Council , Benin strongly recommends that the following principles should be taken into account : an increase in the membership of the Security Council truly reflecting the political and economic configuration of today 's world ; equitable geographical representation of the five regional groups , with the African group entitled to four seats , two permanent and two non-permanent ; and protection of democratic and transparent functioning , ultimately involving the elimination of the right of veto .  
However , we know that we can rely on international cooperation , founded not only on solidarity , but on mutual interest and partnership , to overcome the difficulties confronting us , to support our efforts at economic and social recovery , to build a State genuinely based on the rule of law and to construct a free , democratic , modern and prosperous nation .  
Each must agree to subordinate its individual decision and discretion to a global political will , manifested through truly democratic and representative organs of the United Nations , reflecting the authentic judgement of the world community of States .  
These elections will have positive effects at all levels national , regional , Arab and international for they represent a new and advanced turning point in strengthening the democratic direction that is based on a multi-party political system , freedom of the press , respect for human rights , and the institutional consolidation of the modern Yemeni State . 
It is indeed ironic to note in this Assembly the contradictory positions of some of our members , who purport to be champions and defenders of human rights issues and yet continue to maintain colonial situations that directly deny genuine democratic representation and the rights of people to govern themselves in a manner consistent with their political aspirations . 
At the eleventh summit of Heads of State and Government of the Rio Group , held in Asunci \ x { 93ee } , Paraguay , in August this year , our leaders agreed that the elimination of extreme poverty , the achievement of social justice , the promotion of forms of citizen participation , as well as the improvement of standards of living and the general welfare of our peoples are permanent objectives for our countries and can be more easily achieved through cooperation and coordination between democratic Governments .  
Algeria is keen to preserve what it has achieved , in spite of economic difficulties due to financial constraints and the requirements of economic and institutional restructuring , which are designed firmly to put Algerian society on the path to progress and modernity through the creation of a more efficient market economy and the establishment of a pluralistic democratic society .  
Our strategy for achieving these goals is based on a people-centred approach that attempts to strengthen participation at the grass roots level by providing for decentralized , participatory , village-level democratic institutions with statutory representation for women and socially disadvantaged groups of people .  It is our resolve to place the concerns of gender , the rights and interests of the child , and the potential of the girl child and of youth , at the centre of all our decision-making .  
My delegation wishes to emphasize that current realities of the post-cold-war era the diffusion of political , economic and military power among diverse regions of the world require that decisions affecting the maintenance of international peace and security be made in a more representative and democratic manner , mindful of the sovereign equality of all States .  
Subsequent developments have continued to be positive , and in 1997 we are witnessing for the first time in many years a Central America free of armed conflict , with legitimate Governments chosen through the free expression of popular will in transparent and pluralistic elections , thus strengthening democratic institutions and , as result , the rule of law . 
However , the Dominican Republic is aware that the stability and creditability of a democratic system does not depend on willingness alone , but on a wide range of political , economic , social , cultural and environmental factors .  
Informal , democratic , transparent , universal , open and announced negotiations held in this official Headquarters with technical services can not be replaced by other forms of negotiations which , in lacking these elements , could only be considered complementary to them , if even that .  
Central America has made great progress in demilitarization and in the strengthening of civil society , holding free , transparent and pluralist elections ; integrating former combatants into national political processes ; strengthening democratic institutions and the rule of law ; and implementing a development programme whose central focus is the human being .  
They should have institutional arrangements that are flexible , democratic , transparent and responsive to changing global and regional conditions .  
Recognizing the catastrophic consequences of the civil war in Croatia , resolved to put an end to this situation and influence the remedying of the consequences and the building of new democratic and humane relations , the international community has prevailed upon the two warring parties to sign the Basic ( Erdut ) Agreement . This act put a stop to the civil war . 
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
In this regard , the Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating at the end of September 1996 in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the Secretary _ General of the NLD in her compound .  
In that resolution , the Commission requested the Secretary-General to appoint for a period of one year a person having wide experience in the field of human rights as an independent expert to assist the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Somalia through development of a long-term programme of advisory services for re-establishing human rights and the rule of law , including a democratic constitution , as well as the eventual holding of a periodic and genuine election by universal suffrage and secret ballot .  
Urges all the Afghan parties to work closely with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the peoples of Afghanistan ;  
A thorough assessment by the IPTF Commissioner has now determined that in order to carry out , in a satisfactory manner , the additional and existing tasks relating to human rights investigation , monitoring of the local police , strengthening of police training , police restructuring and the development of guidelines for democratic principles , IPTF will have to move from a police force with primarily generalist functions to one with a substantial number of police experts in specialized fields .  
Recalling the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism annexed to General Assembly resolution 49 / 60 of 9 December 1994 , in which the Assembly declared that acts , methods and practices of terrorism constituted a grave violation of the purpose and principles of the United Nations , and might pose a threat to international peace and security , jeopardize friendly relations among States , hinder international cooperation and aim at the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic bodies of society ,  
Emphasizing the priority that attaches to implementing specific measures to establish mechanisms that will facilitate the attainment of the practical objectives of building a democratic State ruled by law , based on political pluralism , the market economy , supremacy of the law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms ,  
This concept should be understood as designed to rule out all arbitrary conduct but not differences in treatment based on objective and reasonable considerations , in accordance with the principles prevailing in democratic societies .  
Calls upon the Government of Guatemala , URNG and Guatemalan society as a whole to make every possible effort to familiarize the Guatemalan people with the content of the Peace agreements as quickly as possible , to ensure the full participation of the people in building the new multi _ ethnic , multicultural and multilingual nation , establishing a democratic society with social justice , initiating a period of sustained and sustainable economic and social development and ensuring the pre _ eminence of civilian authority in national decision _ making ;

Strongly urges all the Afghan parties to work and cooperate fully with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the establishment of a democratic government elected through free and fair elections , to be held throughout the country and based on the right to self _ determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
Considerable efforts have been made everywhere in Africa to revitalize the social sector , minimize needless waste of human and natural resources , promote popular participation and democratic governance , focus world attention on the continent 's needs for a more supportive international economic environment , and reinforce efforts at conflict prevention and resolution .  
As a single united Government of Angola takes up the daunting task of providing all Angolans with the political stability and economic development which they have so long awaited , it is our sincerest hope that a successful transition to democratic pluralism will replace , once and for all , the violence and mistrust which have historically marked relations between the Government and UNITA .  
Strongly urges all the Afghan parties to work and cooperate fully with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the establishment of a democratic government elected through free and fair elections , to be held throughout the country and based on the right to self _ determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
The Presidents agree that the peoples of the Russian Federation and Ukraine shall continue to live and work in peace and harmony , supporting each other at a crucial stage in their history , when they are carrying out , in their independent sovereign States , large-scale reforms with a view to establishing a democratic society and a State based on rule of law , with a socially oriented market economy .  
Under current trends in global interdependence , international governance would require reaching a global compact on means to enhance job creation at the national level through orderly management of financial and trade flows and through promotion of democratic systems and respect for fundamental labour standards . 
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
These countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies which take into account social development goals as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter of the General Assembly and other updated information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
Specifically , we advocate increased official development assistance , more transparent and democratic financial mechanisms , the transfer of suitable and environmentally benign technologies on concessional terms , the reorientation of technical cooperation to respond to the forces of demand in developing countries in such a way as to utilize and build indigenous expertise , the development of human resources and an improvement in the management systems and processes that run our institutions .  
Injustice , political oppression , human rights abuses , social and economic inequalities , and the absence of democratic freedom and development opportunities are often part of a complex mix of underlying factors contributing to conflict . 
A number of comprehensive country-level employment reviews were undertaken , the framework of which encompassed the major features affecting the level and quality of employment , including national macroeconomic and sectoral policies covering such issues as savings , investment and enterprise development ; labour market policies and institutions ; democratic policy-making and social dialogue ; gender discrimination and child labour ; and trade and capital flows and migratory movements .  
Since 1993 , his Government had been pursuing simultaneously processes aimed at transforming the State , promoting social participation , adapting the production base to the changes in contemporary international life and strengthening democratic and participatory institutions , in the belief that economic development must be compatible with concern for nature and the environment .  
The civil society , including those involved in its political , economic , social and cultural life , needs to be fully engaged to promote democratic principles and harmony between the society , the individual and the environment as a basis for a culture of peace .  
It needs to be questioned to what extent this secrecy is compatible with the access to information necessary for democratic practice and social justice and whether , in some cases , instead of contributing to long-term security , it may conceal information about processes ( ecological , financial , military , etc . ) which are a potential threat to everyone and which need therefore to be addressed collectively . 
The treatment of the interrelated subjects of trade , finance , technology and investment , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies and their social impact in the international context , should be substantive issues in the political debate conducted in the Committee , since the General Assembly was not only the supreme political body at the intergovernmental level but , above all , the most democratic body in existence .  
This concept should be understood as designed to rule out all arbitrary conduct but not differences in treatment based on objective and reasonable considerations , in accordance with the principles prevailing in democratic societies .  
The Turkish Cypriot people have formed a democratic and secular State , with a plural system based on free elections , social justice and the rule of law , with its citizens enjoying all human rights and liberties .

In view of the confirmed role of hemispheric partnership as essential to the welfare of our people and to strengthening a system of individual freedom and social justice based on respect for human rights within a framework of democratic institutions ,  
The greatest challenge faced by Haiti was to build a State ruled by law through the establishment of a modern , effective , independent , democratic and equitable judicial system available to all .  
The international community has paid increased attention to the role that shared democratic values can play in solving major national issues and in improving the international environment .  
While democratic systems can take on different forms according to the prevailing circumstances , there are certain constituent key elements common to all of them , such as accountability , respect for human rights , the rule of law and genuine periodic elections .  
The existing constructive nature of the evolution of international relations towards multipolarity is conducive to the creation of a balanced , stable and democratic new world order free from confrontational attitudes .  
They stressed that the basic principles of a democratic State governed by the rule of law included multi-partyism , freedom of the press , an independent judiciary and free , fair and transparent elections .

As the expert had already observed , the greatest challenge faced by Haiti is to build a State ruled by law through the establishment of a modern , effective , independent , democratic , equitable judicial system available to all .  
The democratic process is not being paralysed by the war : it was already paralysed and the constitutional drafts that have been prepared are not satisfactory to the large majorities which are still represented in the National Sovereign Conference and are , of course , likely to be changed by another authentic national agreement .  
The development process requires a united vision if it is to be sustainable , and it requires joint responsibility on the part of the public and the private sectors to ensure continuity combined with the political stability that strengthens democratic governance .  
In that connection , he raised the issue of due recognition of such associations by the States concerned , based on an agreed set of rules designed , inter alia , to ensure their democratic functioning , transparency and , thus , overall credibility and legitimacy .  
They expressed their grave concern at the renewed outbreak of hostilities in the Congo following the perpetration of acts of destabilization by armed groups , causing huge losses of life and material damage and hindering the implementation of commitments undertaken by the authorities to take measures to promote national reconciliation , rebuild the country and relaunch the democratic process .  
As part of the educational reform , human rights were included in democratic education in order to create a culture of respect for human dignity in the universal context , provide a moral education with values such as honesty , social justice , tolerance , solidarity and respect , create attitudes of perseverance and fortitude in the face of difficulty , and develop creativity geared towards producing alternative solutions .  
The specialized agencies should seek innovative ways of communicating ideas that reinforced democratic processes and spurred development initiatives ; utilizing communication networks , particularly radio and electronic networks , to increase public access to information and facilitate free and fair participation in decision-making processes ; and enhancing participation by people at the grass roots level , who were the hardest hit by poverty .  
It has been widely recognized , nationally and internationally , that the existence of strong and transparent institutions is a prerequisite for an inclusive society based on the rule of law , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice and democratic participation , which takes into account the special needs of vulnerable and disadvantages groups .  
Emphasizes once more that the primary responsibility for ensuring the progressive achievement of democratic goals and building a tolerant , multi-ethnic society lies with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in particular through the central Government and the governments of both entities , as well as through , inter alia , municipal and cantonal authorities , religious communities , humanitarian organizations and non-governmental organizations ;  
Recognizes that the elections held on 7 March 1999 were organized and conducted in a peaceful and calm atmosphere but takes note with concern that some flaws and irregularities were observed during the electoral process , and therefore calls upon the Government of Equatorial Guinea to continue the dialogue with all political parties and to ensure the independence and effectiveness of the national electoral commission , so as to guarantee fair , transparent and democratic conditions in the future ;  
Recognizing also that there is no single political system or single universal model of democracy equally suited to all nations and their peoples and that political systems and the electoral processes which guarantee the establishment of democratic governments are subject to historical , political , cultural and religious factors ,  
Emphasizes once more that the primary responsibility for ensuring the progressive achievement of democratic goals and building a tolerant , multi-ethnic society lies with the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina , in particular through the central Government and the governments of both entities , as well as through , inter alia , municipal and cantonal authorities , religious communities , humanitarian organizations and non-governmental organizations ;

The fact that these parties have committed themselves to respecting the ballot results , to conducting themselves peacefully with mutual respect and to defending pluralistic democracy clearly attests to the maturity of the East Timorese political leaders and their determination to establish the bases of a solid democratic and an economically viable State .

As far as France is concerned , this settlement must be based , on the one hand , on the reaffirmation and full recognition of Israels irrevocable right to live in peace and security within internationally recognized borders , and , on the other hand , on the establishment of a viable , independent and democratic Palestinian State , and this means the end of the occupation of Palestinian territories .

The success of a number of civic movements in winning mayoral elections , the appointment of a Guambian governor in the Department of Cauca - the first indigenous ethnic minority-group representative ever to be elected - and , in general , the maintenance of democratic institutions in a context of internal armed conflict all bear witness to the unbending will of the Government and the State in general to respect political rights .  74 .

Given this situation , which was strange to say the least , the Front Populaire Ivoirien ( FPI , socialist opposition ) candidate , Mr .

This is a solid basis for continuing work in this area , which is steadily increasing in importance in a more interdependent and vulnerable world in which our democratic values are still constantly being challenged by undemocratic and violent acts .  
The international community ought therefore to help poor new democracies like Nepal to accelerate their sustainable economic development and social progress and thus help their quest to consolidate democratic polity , human rights and fundamental freedoms .

It was precisely in this historical process that the CPC formed the CPPCC by integrating the united front theories of Marxism and Leninism with China 's specific practice .  It is a great creation and the fruit of long-term unity and struggle by the CPC along with all democratic parties , mass organizations , and the patriotic personages of all ethnic groups and all walks of life .  
The CPPCC is an organization of the Chinese people 's patriotic united front , with the most extensive representation organizationally and the greatest accommodation politically .  It is an important organization for realizing the political system of multi-party cooperation and political consultations under the leadership of the CPC , as well as an important form of socialist democratic politics which conforms with the Chinese national conditions and serves the fundamental interests of the people .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's remarks have , from a high plane of historical materialism , revealed the fundamental nature of our party ; pointed out the party 's basic tasks ; and are of an important theoretical and practical significance to our efforts to further maintain the advancement of the party , retain the vigor and vitality of the party , lead the whole party and the people of the entire country to carry out struggles in unity , and build our country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized modern socialist power .  
In furthering socialist democratic political construction , the current NPC and its standing committee revised the Village Committee Organization Law , and formulated and adopted the Law on Administrative Appeals . With these and the Administrative Litigation Law , Administrative Punishment Law , Administrative Supervision Law , and State Compensation Law formulated in earlier years , our country has basically established a complete legal system on administrative punishment and relief .  
Committee members focused on central tasks to serve the overall situation , and , from a perspective of pushing forward reform and opening , economic development , and safeguarding stability , earnestly performed their functions in conducting political consultation , exercising democratic supervision , and participating in the administration and discussion of state affairs , and offered many valuable suggestions and proposals , whose quality was better than last year .  
This has been a democratic , pragmatic , united , and inspiring meeting , which made due contribution to the comprehensive fulfillment of the goals set by the party and by the state for this year and to the promotion of the magnificent cause of socialist modernization construction .  
With a high sense of political responsibility , CPPCC members discussed major agenda , put forward many constructive views and suggestions on the administration of the country according to law , reliance on science and technology to invigorate the nation , sustainable development , great development of China 's western regions , reform of the state-owned enterprise , tackling of poverty , social security , democratic supervision , dealing with corruption , and maintaining social stability .  
Qiao Xiaoyang said : Tremendous achievements have been scored in our country 's legislation work , but some problems have also cropped up in practical legislative work as legislation progresses at an accelerated pace and the number of laws enacted multiplies , such as legislation in excess of legal power , conflict and contradiction between different laws , regulations , and rules , low legislative quality , and lack of democratic procedures in legislation .  
The motions put forth by the democratic parties and some members on narrowing the gap between schools at the compulsory education stage ; practically lightening the homework burden of primary and secondary school students ; and so on reflected the problems that had caused strong public resentment and that the education departments at all levels had to tackle without delay .  
to ensure the implementation of the party 's basic line and basic policies systematically and legally ; to ensure the party will always give play to the leading and central role of controlling overall situation and of coordinating all interests .  To develop socialist democratic politics , there is a need to persist in the four cardinal principles , in the national policy of the people 's democratic dictatorship , and in the political body of the national people 's congress system .  
By the middle of the next century , when the Chinese nation reaches the level of an intermediately developed nation with its own hard work , a wealthy , strong , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist China will stand tall in the East !  
Zeng Peiyan said : In the 21st century , China 's targets are to double the 2000 GNP by 2010 to make the people 's comparatively well-off lives even more prosperous and form a relatively complete socialist market economic system and to bring the per capita GDP to the level of an average developing country and basically achieve modernization by the middle of the century to successfully build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist country . 
The telegram says : In the past 45 years , under the leadership of the Lao People 's Revolutionary Party , the people of all nationalities in Laos won a victory in national and democratic revolution , established the Lao People 's Democratic Republic , and continuously made new achievements in safeguarding national independence and state sovereignty and developing national undertakings .  In particular , since the initiation of the innovation and opening up drive , Laos has made ceaseless progress in all undertakings and made noticeable achievements in continuously improving the people 's living standards .  
It is necessary to continue to learn from and spread the management experience of advanced enterprises , such as Hangang and Yaxing ; gradually introduce and consummate management systems and management standards that meet the requirements of market economy at such stages as production , procurement , and sales of an enterprise and in such areas as quality , costs , finance , and capital ; and develop a scientific and democratic decisionmaking system .  
] China will turn itself into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country and bring about rejuvenation of the great Chinese nation .  The Chinese people are ready to join all other peace-loving people in the rest of the world in contributing their wisdom and energy to world peace and development and an even brighter future for mankind .  
To turn China into a rich and strong , democratic , civilized modern socialist country through self-reliance and arduous struggles is the ideal shared by all Chinese nationalities in the primary stage of socialism .  
Following Jiang Zemin 's speech , Zhu Rongji said : In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin fully endorsed the important contributions rendered by the national labor models and advanced workers to reform , opening up , and the socialist modernization drive .  He spoke highly of the lofty spirit of the selfless dedication displayed by the national labor model and advanced workers .  He called on all the people to emulate these advanced models and work hard to build China into an affluent , strong , democratic , and civil socialist modern country .  
To keep to the orientation of the progress of advanced culture , it is necessary to adapt ourselves to the requirements of reform , opening up , and the drive for socialist modernization , to concentrate on improving the ideological , moral , scientific , and cultural qualities of the people across the country , and to unite and mobilize the people of all nationalities throughout the country to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist state .  
The organization work is an important component part of our democratic and political building ; and to make the party 's organization work to effectively serve the country 's central task of economic construction and to provide both a firm and powerful organizational guarantee and a personnel support for the country 's reform , opening up , and modernization building , we must adapt the party 's organization work to the needs of the situation , improve work methods , and strive to enhance the quality of both leading bodies and the contingent of cadres .  
Various democratic parties and personalities without party affiliation holding leading posts in government and judicial organs at various levels , taking part in the state power , and participating in the management of state affairs are an important feature of the democratic parties ' participation in public affairs , which is the concrete embodiment of multiparty cooperation and political consultation system and the organizational guarantee for the practice of this basic political system .  
Giving free rein to democratic parties and non-party personalities in participating in administration and discussion of state affairs is good for the state 's policies , laws , and major decisions to embody the masses ' will to the maximum and conducive to enhancing the scientific and democratic level of the party and government 's policy decisions .  
Many of them are teachers and students .  This may bring the impact of their administrative posts , academic status , and master-student relations into the party .  Thus , it is more necessary to intensify study , enhance the ideological and theoretical quality , strictly follow the requirement of the democratic centralist system , set aright the position of an individual , approach things from the across-the-board interests of section development .  
The Party 's grassroots organizations should profoundly solve the conspicuous problems arising in strengthening the leadership over ideological and political construction , in adhering to the principle of democratic centralism , in strengthening their sense of principles and their combat strength , in conforming to the system of regular activities at grassroots organizations , and in purifying the trend at the grassroots units .  
To give play to the role of local party committees as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level through controlling the across-the-board situation and coordinating all quarters concerned , it is necessary to further reinforce the leading body of the local party committee itself , actually pursue democratic decision-making , and ensure collective leadership according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
According to Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement of " collective leadership , democratic centralization , individual consideration , decision-making at meetings " , we have gradually established corresponding work regulations and work systems , thus providing institutional guarantees for the local party committee to better play its role as the core of leadership in controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned according to the principle of democratic centralism .  
The establishment of these systems made the work of the standing committee more regular , systematic , and scientific , and provided an institutional guarantee for the better implementation of the democratic centralization principle in the standing committee of the municipal party committee , and enabled it to better play its role as the core of leadership among all organizations at the same level in the course of controlling the overall situation and coordinating all quarters concerned .  
In some localities today , there exist such phenomena as requesting for official positions , buying and selling official positions , being responsible to only superiors but not subordinates , currying favor with the powerful , adjusting behavior to the leading cadre 's expression .  A very important cause for such phenomena is that the selection and appointment of cadres are decided by a few persons only without being subject to an effective democratic supervision .  
The most fundamental point is to , in accordance with the requirements of Comrade Jiang Zemin , consistently promote education on patriotism , the collective and socialism and to mobilize all people in the entire country to struggle for the cause of constructing socialism with Chinese characteristics and to struggle for building China into a modernized socialist country that is rich , powerful , democratic and civilized .  
[ Zeng ] Following the progress of the economic and political structural reforms , the cadres and personnel system reform has gradually proceeded , developed in an in-depth manner , and yielded great results , during which we have gained rich experience and probed some rules .  These can be summed up in six aspects : We must hold firm to the correct direction that the organization line must serve the political line and correspond with the establishment of the socialist market economic structure and the development of socialist democratic politics ;  
The conviction of the people in socialism has been transformed into concrete practice for developing economy , improving livelihood , and building a prosperous , powerful , democratic , and civilized socialist country .  
The civilization and progress of the society , the vivid and lively political environment , and especially the socialist democratic and political life created and developed by the people under the leadership of the party have made people 's minds greatly tempered and increasingly mature .  
Whether or not we can uphold democratic centralism , regularly and consciously take up the weapon of criticism and self-criticism , and unfold active and healthy ideological struggle represent an important yardstick for measuring whether a leadership group is strong and effective and whether a leading cadre is truly upright .  
Third , cadre appointments must be based on the principle of incorruptibility .  Outstanding candidates selected through democratic procedures and proved to be honest and upright in their behavior by the assessment of the organization should be appointed to key positions without hesitation so that they may play a exemplary and guiding role in the cadre contingent and encourage all cadres to maintain the spirit of working hard in making progress .  
This requires the maintenance of the democratic centralist system and the effective implementation of the collective leadership system and the regulations for making decisions through collective discussion .  The internal supervision and the check-and-balance capacity inside leading bodies must be increased .  
The people 's democratic dictatorship as a form of state and the people 's congress system as a form of government of what our country has been pursuing are the result of the people 's struggle and a historical choice made by the people .  They are the corner stone of our country 's political system which not only suits our country 's national conditions but also reflects the substantive requirements of socialism .  
Through studying the Constitution and acquiring basic legal knowledge , the broad mass of citizens gradually acquired the consciousness of exercising rights according to laws , taking part in democratic management , fulfilling legal obligations , and maintaining their own legitimate rights and interests .  And there initially emerged in society the excellent trend of studying laws , abiding by laws , exercising laws , and maintaining laws .  
In his " On New Democracy " , written in his Yanan days , Mao Zedong put forward this slogan : " A national , scientific , popular new democratic culture . "  He defined the characteristics and direction of China 's new culture in terms of " science " and put forward the following definition of " scientific : " " It means opposing all feudal thought and superstitious thought , advocating the seeking of truth from facts , upholding objective truth , and insisting that theory and practice be consistent with each other " .  
the United States , today , should " establish an international system composed of strong alliances and organizations " with other democratic partners , and should " also be ready to step forward to defend these standards ( meaning the US concepts of values ) when they are threatened . "  
This meant that they were subject to double suffering and double tragic fate , which made the social and class contradictions of the undeveloped nations even more acute , such that they had no other way out except revolution , and outbursts of democratic revolutions in these countries became an inevitable necessity .  
On the contrary , we must be clearly aware that once the economically and culturally backward nations establish a capitalist system , they must spend appropriately long time to complete the tasks that must be completed during the capitalist stage : socialization , commercialization , industrialization , and modernization of production , as well as the establishing of appropriate democratic legal system , science and culture .  
" Special privilege " mentality , patriarchal style , obsession of hierarchy and other feudal things , in conjunction with the corrosion by decadent capitalist ideas and culture , have inflicted damage on the party building with regard to ideology , organization , and style of work , such that some leading cadres have obscured the nature and purpose of the party , even to the deterioration of the socialist democratic legal system .  
- - Attach importance to and improve strategic studies in enterprise development , implement scientific and democratic decision making in order to avoid major mistakes due to rash decisions , establish a responsibility system for major decision making in enterprises , and hold relevant personnel accountable in cases where enterprises suffer serious losses due to violations of relevant laws , regulations , and industrial policies . 
In recent years , given the complicated circumstances where international struggles changed tremendously and domestic reforms constantly intensified , and in the face of severe economic , political and natural tests , the united front promoted a united and stable political situation and also created a vigorous and vital democratic atmosphere .  It has relied most on Deng Xiaoping Theory , and united front theory for the new period , in particular .  
Given the circumstances of the socialist market economy , the Party Central Committee has also adapted to the transition in the Party 's approach toward leadership and managing state affairs , has realistically improved Party leadership , displayed Party leadership of the united front on democratic consultation , made the Party 's correct stand become the common ground of the vast majority of members of the united front , and united and led them to work for the great cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics .  
In recent years , relevant mass organizations such as various democratic parties and associations of industry and commerce have gradually experienced political transitions where new leading members have replaced old ones , united and mutually beneficial national relations have been further consolidated , and major progress has been made in relations between religion and socialist society ; the most fundamental reason for all of this is that a high-quality contingent of non-party leaders has been cultivated .  
Because of all this , it has become a top priority for the Chinese in the post-Deng era to diligent pursue the establishment of effective supervision mechanisms suited for China 's national conditions and to promote democratic system innovation in a situation of relative political stability , so as to prevent China from being trapped in endemic corruption and an " emergency room paradox " resulting from the dilemma created by the contradictions . 
The second contradiction is that in the process of international interactions in the post-Cold War era , international contradictions and conflicts may lead to the formation of the current of thought of radical nationalism which will get combined with leftist speech because of the existence of a large amount of leftist speech in China 's traditional ideological resources , resulting in the undermining of balanced development of pluralist intellectual differentiation and , eventually , affecting the democratic process . 
In upholding the people 's democratic dictatorship , we must properly preserve national sovereignty , security , unity , and stability on the basis of people 's democracy , crack down hard according to law on lawbreaking and criminal activities that jeopardize the socialist system , reform , opening up , and socialist modernization , and people 's lives and property , and give full play to its role in protecting the people and cracking down on the enemy .  
In 2000 , the Ninth Five-Year for National Economic and Social Development was successfully completed , the development of the western region got off to a good start , and the economy developed in a healthy way .  During that year , China 's democratic and legal systems were continuously strengthened , and its human rights situation maintained a good momentum of development .  
In light of China 's national conditions and according to the people 's wishes , the Chinese government aims to build a democratic and modernized country with a high level of civilization under the rule of law , and actively learn from the beneficial experiences and cultural achievements of other countries .  While maintaining social stability , it also aims to expedite development , strengthen the democratic legal system , promote spiritual civilization , and continuously push forward the development of the human rights cause .  
Implementing the revised Regional National Autonomy Law will play a greater role in further keeping to and improving the system of regional national autonomy in our country , accelerating economic and social development in areas inhabited by ethnic minorities , protecting unification of the country , strengthening unity of people of various nationalities , ensuring social stability , and building a rich , powerful , democratic , civilized and modernized socialist country .  
Doing a good job in selecting and promoting female cadres and recruiting more female party members is a need in our efforts to fulfill the new tasks under the new situation , to meet the " three represents " requirement , and to build a strong high-quality cadre contingent and to reinforce the party rank and file , and is also an important component part of our work in developing socialist democratic politics and promoting social progress .  
China is a socialist country of the people 's democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance , and our party is the sole political party of the Chinese proletariat , the core of leadership of the socialist cause , and the creator of our armed forces .  This determines the scientific and correct nature of the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces .  
The people of all ethnic groups in China are united as one , and are working hard together with one heart to build our country into a strong , prosperous , democratic , civilized and modern socialist country .  
Under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee , all CPV members and the Vietnamese people will work with one heart and move forward in unity according to the principles laid down by the Ninth CPV National Congress ; will successfully fulfill the strategic targets proposed by the congress ; and will build Vietnam into a powerful , democratic , civilized , socialist , and industrialized country where the people live in prosperity .  
Third , the reserve cadre contingent was strengthened to a new degree .  According to the working guideline of " replenishing leading bodies and strengthening reserve force , " through the procedures of democratic recommendation and strict evaluation by the party organizations , outstanding young cadres were added to the reserve cadre contingents at various levels .  These promising young cadres have good political quality and strong work ability , and they are now selected as candidates for leading positions at a higher level .  
Wei Jianxing expressed the hope that the broad masses of staff members and workers would take model workers as models , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , heighten their fighting spirit and work in a down-to-earth manner in line with the requirements of the " three represents , " and strenuously struggle to build our country into a prosperous , powerful , democratic , civilized socialist modern country .  
We are convinced that , under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by Nong Duc Manh , the Vietnamese people will surely follow the policies set at the congress , work hard in unity to victoriously fulfill the set strategic objectives , and built Vietnam into a rich , strong , fair , democratic , civilized yet industrialized socialist country .  
We profoundly believe that under the leadership of the CPV Central Committee headed by General Secretary Nong Duc Manh , by following the guidelines and policies set by the Ninth CPV Congress , and working with concerted and united efforts , the Vietnamese people will victoriously achieve the strategic goals set down , and build Vietnam into a rich and strong , socially fair , democratic , and civilized socialist industrialized country .

It is also playing an important role in promoting the multipolarization of the world and establishing a new international political and economic order that is fair , reasonable , and democratic .  
A careful reading of the facts of the case reveals that this political agenda , pursued essentially through external forces , is three projects rolled into one - splitting Tibet from China , carving out a ' Greater Tibet ' through ethnic cleansing , and restoring a moth-eaten theocracy , the ancient regime with some modest , if not quite cosmetic , ' democratic ' changes .  
The basic question of the trade union work is an issue of safeguarding rights .  All work of the trade union should be carried out in close connection with this most fundamental issue , that is , safeguarding the economic interests and democratic rights of workers and staff members and fulfilling their spiritual and cultural needs .  
Political party politics is especially far from maturity - - the old system has been destroyed , but the new rules and new standards are not yet completely set up .  Even though the new system has already been established , it does not yet get its due respect and lacks authority , and the so-called " democratic system " does not exist .  Rather , the politicians lack " democratic accomplishments , " and the sudden turnover of political parties has inevitably led to violent political , economic , and social upheaval .  
Referring to the situation where cadres still lack a democratic and legal system , the 13th Party Congress consequently proposed to regard the establishment of a state public functionary system as the focus for reforming the personnel system of cadres to conduct scientific management of the contingent of cadres according to law ; thus transforming the previous outdated unitary management pattern and allowing the establishment of a new-type personnel system of cadres based on the principles of attaching importance to solid performance , encouraging competition , and exercising democratic and separated supervisions .  
Over the last 50 years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet , epoch-making and deep-going changes have taken place in Tibet . It has completed democratic reform , abolished the feudal serf system , and realized the regional autonomy of minority nationalities .  Millions of serfs who did not even have basic human rights in the past have truly become masters of society and the country .  
Attention should be paid to fostering citizen 's modern legal concept of equal rights and obligations and strengthening their sense of abiding by the law and discipline , protecting their own legitimate rights and interests , and engaging in democratic participation and supervision .  
In accordance with the relevant provisions of laws , it is necessary to formulate Village regulations , the rules of conduct for villagers , residents ' pledges , and the rules for managing basic units according to law , to set up an effective operating mechanism , to exercise democratic management and supervision , and to strengthen legitimate management at the basic level .  
Only when we adapt ourselves to the transformation from a planned economic structure to a market economic structure and only when we materialize the change from a structure ruled by man which is based on a highly developed centralization of individual power to a democratic structure ruled by law can we open up a new prospect in " the building of a socialist country ruled by law , " indicated Wang Guixiu .  
People 's democratic dictatorship is the fundamental road to Tibet 's development and stability .  To uphold people 's democratic dictatorship in Tibet , we must make constant efforts to foster socialist democracy , perfect the system of regional autonomy in areas inhabited by minority nationalities , firmly crack down on sabotages committed by the Dalai clique and on all kinds of criminal activities harmful to national security , safeguard the motherland 's unification and ethnic unity , and seriously protect the fundamental interests of the masses .  
The objective of the Fourth 5-Year Plan on Law Popularization is to realize " two points of improvement " and " two transformations . "  The two points of improvement refers to , in light of the principle of our constitution and the development progress of socialist democratic legal construction in the new development stage , profoundly promoting educational activities to disseminate the law and comprehensively improve the legal quality of all citizens as a whole , particularly leading cadres at all levels .  
We have also emphasized that since the party 's leadership means ideological , political and organizational leadership , party committees must bring into play their role in assuming overall responsibility and coordinating the work of different quarters and make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
They should continue to carry forward democracy and play a positive and active role in advancing the building of democratic politics in the capital , actively assist the party committee and the government in coordinating relations of all sides and resolving contradictions , thus safeguarding the social and political stability of the national capital .  
If this situation is not resolved , people will be unable to clearly distinguish between the problems of national position , the independence and reunification issue and values of political parties and ideology , and will be unable to understand that free and democratic human rights can not supersede the framework of national sovereignty and the integrity of territory .  The DPP government of Chen Shui-bian can not let go of their evil intentions in the form of a coalition government .  
At the beginning of the 20th century , Sun Yat-sen led the revolution of 1911 , aimed at overthrowing the autocratic monarchical system that had governed China over thousands of years .  This revolution marked the beginning of the genuine national democratic revolution in the history of modern China and paved the way for China 's progress .  However , this revolution still failed in changing China 's nature of a semi-colonial and semi-feudalistic society and saving the Chinese people from miseries .  
On the basis of meticulously reviewing the positive and negative experiences , recollecting its courage and confidence and correcting its mistakes , the party established and adhered to the ideological line of seeking the truth from facts , gradually understood the practical situation of China , created a road of " circling cities with rural areas and taking over political power through arms " ? which suited the Chinese practical situation and won the victory of a modern national democratic revolution .  
Mao Zedong opposed book worship and started out from the actual conditions of the Chinese revolution to skillfully combine basic Marxist principles with China 's revolutionary practices and creatively develop Marxism and Leninism . He advanced the new democratic revolution theory and the theory of embarking on the road of surrounding the cities with villages , and with that , he seized victory in the Chinese revolution and truly achieved the first great leap in integrating basic Marxist and Leninist principles with China 's realistic conditions .  
Answer : A host of facts has proved that Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " cult organization have completely transformed into an out-and-out reactionary political organization and a political force and have become the tool of international anti-China forces and the splittist forces in Taiwan for subverting the political power of our people 's democratic dictatorship and the socialist system and for undermining national unification .  
They " removed the red star but kept their red heart , and changed their cap insignia but did not change their tradition " .  Their heart is forever facing the CPC . In the course of fulfilling their task of national liberation , our army never forgot their mission of democratic revolution , were sober-minded , smashed the KMT created incidents of " friction " within the united front , maintained high morale at the end of the national war , waged resolute struggle against the KMT reactionaries , and won final victory in the liberation war .  
In order to strengthen guidance for building rural grass-roots party organizations , the central authorities and relevant departments promulgated in succession the " CPC regulations governing the work of rural grass-roots organizations " , the " opinions of the organization department of the CPC Central Committee on strengthening the building of ranks of rural grass-roots cadres " , the " circular on universally implementing in the rural areas the systems of making village affairs public and managing village affairs in a democratic way " , and other important documents .  
During his 12 years in power , Lee Teng-hui played political trickery to the utmost , excluded those not agreeing with him , was tyrannical and domineering , and , mechanically copying the Western parliamentary democracy model , directed several " constitutional amendments " and elections , prompting Taiwan to become a place " filled with a sense of confrontation and hatred " and distorting all mechanisms of a modern democratic society .  
The first leap took place during the new democratic revolutionary period .  The first generation of central leadership collective with Mao Zedong at the core led the whole party and the people throughout the country to find China 's own revolutionary road through repeated explorations and on the basis of summing up successful and unsuccessful experiences , and established Mao Zedong Thought .  
and it played an important role in consolidating people 's democratic dictatorship , and in pushing forward the historical process of socialist revolution and construction in China .  With the arrival of the new historical period , the China Democratic League has showed its firm support for the line , principles , and policies that the CPC has adopted ever since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee ; conscientiously performed its role as a party participating in government and political affairs ;  
In the period of socialist revolution and construction , to strive for national prosperity and strengthening , our party continued to consolidate and expand the people 's democratic united front in the efforts for restoring the economy , developing production , carrying out socialist transformation , establishing the socialist system , and starting the comprehensive explorations of socialist construction .  
We must rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and , in line with the requirement of the three represents , carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions , closely follow the advancing pace of the times , emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , carry out hard struggle , forge ahead , and strive to turn our country into a rich , powerful , democratic , civilized , and modern socialist country .

Since its birth , the party " has been fighting not only for political and economic revolution in China , but also for cultural revolution in our country . "  Liu Yunshan pointed out : The party developed a new democratic culture - - a national , scientific and mass culture .  
It is hoped that CPPCC organizations at all levels , all democratic parties and mass organizations participating in the CPPCC , including the federation of industrialists and businessmen , will take actions according to their own conditions by taking the experience exchanged at this meeting as reference , work out their methods of advancing the work of finding out and reflecting social conditions and popular opinions , and effectively implement the spirit of this meeting .  
Over the past 80 years , the people of all ethnic groups , the democratic parties , and progressive figures in all circles in our country always share weal and woe and fight side by side together with our party for our nation 's independence , prosperity , and bright future .  In the historical process of revolution , construction , and reform , they demonstrate a strong patriotic spirit and an indomitable fighting spirit .  
The purpose of the new democratic revolution led by our party was to abrogate the imperialist privileges in China , eliminate exploitation and oppression by the landlord class and the bureaucrat-capitalist class , change the comprador feudal production relations and the rotten political superstructure built on such an economic base , establish a new political superstructure with the people 's democratic dictatorship as the core and fundamentally emancipate the fettered productive forces .  
Under no circumstances should comrades of the whole party stand still and refuse to move forward , nor should they fear hardship and difficulties .  We must closely unite with people of all ethnic groups in China and strive to build the great motherland into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country so as to make new and even greater contributions to humanity .  
All comrades of the party must unswervingly implement the party 's basic line for the initial stage of socialism , consistently concentrate on economic development , stick to the Four Cardinal Principles [ keeping to the socialist road and upholding the people 's democratic dictatorship , leadership by the Communist Party , and Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought ] , press ahead with reform and opening up , strive for the realization of the basic program of the party for the present stage and constantly advance the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics into the future .  
Under no circumstances should comrades of the party stand still and refuse to move forward , nor should they fear hardship and difficulties .  All comrades must closely unite with the people of all ethnic groups in China and strive to build our great motherland into a strong , prosperous , democratic and culturally advanced modern socialist country and make new and even greater contributions to mankind .  
We should learn from them their setting strict discipline for the party , implementing the principle of democratic centralism , being impartial and upright , setting strict demand on self , working hard , having clean hands , and daring to fight against unhealthy tendencies .  
responsible persons of central committees of democratic parties , the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce , and mass bodies concerned ; and figures from various united front circles who are in Beijing , including non-party figures , representatives of intellectuals outside the CPC , representatives of ethnic and religious circles , and representatives of Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan compatriots and overseas Chinese compatriots .

The links and procedures for competitive appointment must be improved and quantity graded method for such links as written tests , interviews , democratic polls and evaluations must be formulated , and examinations must be organized .  Mass participation in this program must be expanded and public introduction of candidates before their appointments must be improved .  
According to Deng Xiaoping 's idea about building new-type party-to-party relations , our party adopted the basic principles of " independence and self-determination , complete equality , mutual respect , and mutual non-interference in the other side 's internal affairs " for party-to-party relations .  By casting aside previous grievances and looking ahead to the future , we gradually restored friendly relations with Communist Parties and Workers ' Parties in other countries .  At the same time , we also gradually came into extensive contacts with nationalist and democratic political parties in developing countries .  
We must study their style of learning in which the vigorous promotion of theory is tied to reality , resolutely arming ourselves with Marxism-Leninism , Mao Zedong Thought , and particularly Deng Xiaoping theory and the important concept of the " three represents , " concentrating on the study of modern scientific and technical knowledge , market economy knowledge , and knowledge of democratic legal systems , etc . , striving to master our main occupations and continually improving ourselves .

The system of division of labor with individual responsibilities for senior officers under the unified and collective leadership of Party committees is the realization pattern for implementing the system of democratic centralism in the army , a fundamental system for exercising absolute leadership of the Party over the army , and also an effective mechanism for Party committees to exercise leadership over the troops .  
Yu Muming said in his briefing : In addition to the six points of common understanding , the understanding of the delegation of the New Party 's Mainland Affairs Committee about one China and peaceful reunification is that the Chinese people on both sides of the strait should reunify Taiwan with the Mainland , which are now separated from each other , and make concerted efforts to build a democratic and prosperous China belonging to the Chinese nation .  
China 's and Russia 's further enhancing strategic cooperation , joint dedication to maintaining world peace , bringing about common development , promoting the multi-polar process in the world and establishing a new , democratic , and rational international political and economic order are the requirements that the situation has called upon us , which are our unshirkable responsibilities .  
China and Russia should further strengthen their strategic cooperation , and work jointly to safeguard world peace , promote common development , promote the process of the world 's multi-polarization , promote the establishment of a new international political and economic order of being democratic , just , and reasonable .  This is a requirement set forth by the current situation for us , and is also our unshirkable responsibility .  
During the period of democratic revolution , given the special conditions of our country at the time , we had no choice but to base our revolution in the rural areas , so the working class and the peasants formed a close alliance .  As a result , the majority of the members of our Party and the revolutionary troops led by the Party were peasants .  
The historical mission for the current period put forth by our Party is , through reform and opening-up , to further liberate and develop the productive forces , promote national economic , political and cultural development in an all-around way , continuously improve people 's material and cultural standards of living , strive to build China into a prosperous , strong , democratic , civilized , modernized socialist country , and strive for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese people .

As result of the democratic reform and socialist transformation as well as the ongoing reforms and opening up , Tibet has liberated and developed its social productivity in an unprecedented scale .  Last year , the region 's gross domestic product was more than 50 times that of the period before the democratic reform in 1959 .  
The system according to which the leading commander of a military unit is responsible for this unit and which stipulates that this unit should be under the collective leadership of the Party committee of this unit as well ? is a way to carry out the democratic centralization system in the military ; it is the fundamental system for adhering to the Party 's absolute leadership over the military and is an effective mechanism for Party committees to lead military forces .  
Our army is the massive pillar of the people 's democratic dictatorship .  The Constitution has entrusted us with the sacred duty of consolidating our national defense , resisting aggression , defending our motherland , and safeguarding the people 's labor in peace .  Moreover , to uphold the Party 's centralized power and unity of the state is our army 's basic prerequisite and necessary requirement to perform these duties .  
Since the peaceful liberation 50 years ago , Tibet has witnessed profound social changes , including the democratic reform as well as reform and opening up , and has scored world-renowned successes in its political , economic , and cultural development .  
In carrying out political structure reforms , we want to further carry forward socialist democracy and legal system , perfect the specific systems of socialist democracy , ensure that the people can fully exercise their rights of democratic election , democratic decisionmaking , democratic management , and democratic supervision , boost the vitality of the party and state , fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the grass roots and the masses , promote the effort to make decisionmaking a scientific and democratic affair , and bring into further play the superiority and characteristics of the socialist system .

After the Cold War started , the United States abandoned halfway a democratic reform designed for Japan and stopped short of cleaning up the Japanese militarism .  Nor did the United States liquidate Japan 's bureaucratic institutions left over from the pre-war period .  
Specifically speaking , it is necessary to create a rather positive working environment , a harmonious and agreeable environment of interpersonal relationships , an academic environment that is democratic and lively , a rather comfortable living environment , and a social environment that is respectful and understanding .  
Over the past 20-odd years , the Chinese Government has overcome various difficulties .  It has successfully transformed a contingent of leading cadres who were quite old and whose educational levels were quite low into another contingent of leading cadres who are " relatively young " and " knowledgeable . "  Immediately afterward , it has vigorously launched another round of reform in the systems governing cadres and personnel which aims to be more democratic in the process of hiring officials .  
Local figures believe : Striving to be more democratic in the process of hiring officials will not only exert positive and far-reaching impacts on China 's efforts to prevent and crack down on corrupt activities , but also definitely facilitate a comprehensive , sustained , and rapid development in China 's social and economic endeavors .  
Zeng Peiyan says : Looking ahead , China will , by the middle of the next century , have attained its third-step strategic objective and become an affluent , powerful , democratic , and civil socialist modern country and the Chinese nation will have achieved its great revitalization !  
A tremendous change , which is hardly detected by people , has occurred in the trend of China 's political thinking .  The change has occurred since China launched the drive of reform and opening up about 20 years ago .  The trend shows that a rational democratic concept and attitude has begun to be the main stream of social life , enabling China to have a very important and stable foundation for further political reform .  
One of the most prominent mistakes in this misunderstanding zone is this : Some immature methods adopted in the past by the Chinese intellectual elite and common Chinese people in their pursue of democracy have been considered as China 's democratic methods .  These methods have been treated as a standard for the evaluation of China 's current democratic progress .  Consequently , a misunderstanding zone has been created .  
Likewise , in this vicious circle , people have accustomed to this situation : Instead of doing rational and sober thinking about democratic progress and doing things in a thoroughgoing manner , people have accustomed to raucous campaigns and movements .  They have accustomed to this idea : The first thing to do is to destroy all the things that are old .  
The great and universal imperial power has suppressed all democratic practices that seem promising .  It has made budding democracy disappear in the long river of history by killing it in the bud .  As a result , democracy has not been able to form a tradition in our political culture , or become a tradition of non-main stream .  
Due to these objective factors , neither the broad masses of people nor the leading elite of democratic movement has conducted profound thinking from a rational viewpoint before they adopt democracy , which is considered as a good medicine to cure China 's political and social problems .  As a result , the above-mentioned abnormal phenomena have been created .  In fact , no one should be blamed for the phenomena .  
In addition , with the continuous improvement of democracy and the construction of the legal system , they have made prominent progress in democratic supervision , participation in and deliberation of state affairs , religious beliefs , and other political rights .  So long as China continues to follow the road of development that is in line with its national situation , China will achieve major progress in its social and economic development and the Chinese people will enjoy an even higher level of human rights .  
Ye Xuanping also summed up the new progress made by the CPPCC National Committee in making the democratic channels unimpeded and reflecting the social situation and popular will , safeguarding unity and stability and developing the united front , unfolding non-government diplomacy and expanding friendly contacts , and strengthening its own construction and improving the work of its organs .  
In addition , the Chinese Government 's ban of the cult Falungong and the nationwide drive to expose and repudiate it have dealt a powerful blow to the cult 's criminal activities designed to poison the public , disrupt social order , and subvert the government .  This has helped stabilize society and is conducive to the popularization of science and democratic ideas and to the rule of law .  
As soon as the central authorities put forward the strategic decision of implementing the strategy of a large-scale west development , people 's political consultative conferences at all levels and all democratic parties have given a positive response , gone into immediate action , and unfolded the work in many aspects .  
Member Wang Daming suggested that the CPPCC step up its democratic supervision and strive to curb corruptive practices .  In spite of the fact that such supervision does not carry the legal force for mandatory compliance or disciplinary restraint , it nevertheless can play a guiding , warning , suppression and publicity role .  When exercised in coordination with authoritative supervision , it will produce an even greater influence .  
These non-traditional acts of violence are not accepted as legal national means of war by today 's international military systems and by modern international laws on armed confrontation , because by most countries ' existing laws and moral order , most of those acts are clearly and unmistakably illegal acts of violence .  A country founded on laws and democratic traditions can not regard an illegal act as a legal means .  
A short time ago , the Legislative Council members of the " democratic factions " proposed a motion to " revise the Basic Law , " demanding that all the members of the Legislative Council be elected through direct voting ahead of schedule , and that the chief executive of the HKSAR be directly elected by way of " one man one vote . "  
Therefore , in actual life , freedom of press is a free and democratic right approved [ ren ke 6126 0668 ] and protected by the law .  Meanwhile , there are also specific limiting stipulations to prevent the wanton use of freedom of press in order to more effectively protect the realization of freedom of press .

So long as China continues to follow the road of development that is in line with its national situation , China will achieve major progress in its social and economic development and the Chinese people will enjoy an even higher level of human rights .  
Ye Xuanping also summed up the new progress made by the CPPCC National Committee in making the democratic channels unimpeded and reflecting the social situation and popular will , safeguarding unity and stability and developing the united front , unfolding non-government diplomacy and expanding friendly contacts , and strengthening its own construction and improving the work of its organs .  
In addition , the Chinese Government 's ban of the cult Falungong and the nationwide drive to expose and repudiate it have dealt a powerful blow to the cult 's criminal activities designed to poison the public , disrupt social order , and subvert the government .  This has helped stabilize society and is conducive to the popularization of science and democratic ideas and to the rule of law .  
As soon as the central authorities put forward the strategic decision of implementing the strategy of a large-scale west development , people 's political consultative conferences at all levels and all democratic parties have given a positive response , gone into immediate action , and unfolded the work in many aspects .  
Member Wang Daming suggested that the CPPCC step up its democratic supervision and strive to curb corruptive practices .  In spite of the fact that such supervision does not carry the legal force for mandatory compliance or disciplinary restraint , it nevertheless can play a guiding , warning , suppression and publicity role .  When exercised in coordination with authoritative supervision , it will produce an even greater influence .  
These non-traditional acts of violence are not accepted as legal national means of war by today 's international military systems and by modern international laws on armed confrontation , because by most countries ' existing laws and moral order , most of those acts are clearly and unmistakably illegal acts of violence .  A country founded on laws and democratic traditions can not regard an illegal act as a legal means .  
A short time ago , the Legislative Council members of the " democratic factions " proposed a motion to " revise the Basic Law , " demanding that all the members of the Legislative Council be elected through direct voting ahead of schedule , and that the chief executive of the HKSAR be directly elected by way of " one man one vote . "  
Therefore , in actual life , freedom of press is a free and democratic right approved [ ren ke 6126 0668 ] and protected by the law .  Meanwhile , there are also specific limiting stipulations to prevent the wanton use of freedom of press in order to more effectively protect the realization of freedom of press .  
We must , in the patriotic spirit of Comrades Li Fuchun and Cai Chang , encourage the entire party and the people of the whole country to support from beginning to end taking economic construction as the center , industriously establishing China as a powerful , democratic , and civilized modernized socialist country , realizing the grand reemergence of the People 's Republic in the 21st Century .  
Family planning associations at the grass-roots level should take an active part in exercising democratic management and supervision over family planning and making family planning matters in the villages known to the public , and advance grass-roots democracy , legal institutions , and spiritual civilization , so as to promote social and economic development and political stability .  
The Tibet issue has all along been a " human rights " hot spot ; even then the CSHRS has not evaded this difficult issue but instead has expounded , with a host of facts , on the great changes that have taken place since Tibet implemented the democratic reform and wiped out the feudal serfdom to refute the Dalai clique and international hostile forces ' distortions of and attacks on Tibet 's human rights situation .  
It is true that the new Taiwan leader purposely and very nicely packaged " Taiwan independence " theories and did not specifically mention " Taiwan independence " at all .  However , the main theme of " Taiwan independence " permeated the whole speech .  He particularly stressed the " democratic and equal " status between " Taiwan " and " China , " purposely severed the connections between Taiwan and mother mainland , and words and sentences about splittist concepts and separatism were abundant .  
They completed the initial draft of the " great democratic constitution " in June that year ; this openly proclaimed that " Taiwan and mainland China should be based on the principle of peace , equality , coexistence , and mutual benefit , and respect each other 's national sovereignty and the integrity of the right to rule the areas under their jurisdiction , " and " the governments of Taiwan and mainland China should deal with all business according to international law and convention . "  
We have mentioned earlier in this article that the Taiwan authorities , who are holding high the " democracy and human rights " banner , have always vilified the motherland and the Chinese Communists to seek benefits for themselves .  As a result of extensive publicity and slander over a long period , a simple psychological pattern has been created in the Taiwan people that the mainland 's socialist system and the Chinese Communists ' leadership is no good and not free and democratic , whereas Taiwan 's capitalist system is good , free , and democratic .  
The making of these top-level , knowledge-intensive decisions requires that comrades of the NPC must have a high ideological , theoretical and policy level and possess various kinds of scientific and specialized knowledge .  Otherwise they will not be able to formulate distinct , precise , specific and feasible laws and regulations that embody the party 's views , represents the will of the whole nation , and conform with the laws of objective reality , and it will not be possible to make the decisionmaking process more scientific and democratic .  
Four major changes will emerge in China in the next 10 years to meet the new situation of technological progress and economic globalization in the world .  The speech of Premier Zhu Rongji pointed out the bright future of China , heartened the confidence of 1.2 billion people in building a prosperous , powerful , and democratic China , and inspired the willingness of foreign businesses to increase investment in China .  
When the " 4 June " incident took place on the mother mainland in 1989 , the statements made by the then new Taiwan leader involved the phrases with Chinese historical complex , such as the " free Republic of China " " supported its patriotic compatriots , " who should " closely unite as one " to " realize democratic reunification . "  One-China that Chiang Kai-shek and his son Chiang Ching-kuo followed during their rule of Taiwan for decades can " carefully be observed " in their statements .  
Having made achievements of world interest during the five decades since it came into power in leading the people in carrying out socialist revolution and construction as well as the reform and opening to the outside world and in unremittingly struggling to build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country , our party is worthy of being the choice of history and the people .  
Viewed as a whole , all of our party 's efforts in leading the revolution , construction , and reform have been for emancipating and developing the productive forces and for advancing the development of China 's socialist democratic politics and culture and thus have complied with the objective law of social development , conformed to the advanced trends of development of the times , safeguarded the overall interests of the Chinese nation , and accorded with the fundamental demands of the masses of the people .  
This policy forced the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan to lift the Martial Law at the end of 1986 and to open up indirect " three links " on both sides of the strait , enabled Taiwan to have opportunities to carry out a series of social , political and economic reforms under a peaceful environment , and facilitated democratic politics and free market economy in Taiwan .  
When conducting a " strategic security tour " to Washington in April 1999 , he had extensive contacts with US congressmen and officials .  One of his purposes was to " express firmly to them that the security , dignity , and development in Taiwan must be safeguarded and supported .  A free and democratic Taiwan is the key to global strategic security and one of the links in US national interests . "  
On the track of the Basic Law , Hong Kong 's original capitalist system and way of life have been successfully extended , the Hong Kong people are enjoying more democratic rights and a greater freedom , and its legal system has been strengthened on a constant basis .  All this has won the repeated acclamations of the whole world .  
Under the main orientation of orderly and gradual development of Hong Kong 's democratic political system , the Basic Law lays down the method for producing the chief executive and legislative organs of the SAR , and there are clear regulations on the emergence and appointment of the chief executive and the leading officials .  
Wei Jianxing emphasized : In undertaking the large-scale development of the western region , leading bodies at various levels should do better in making decisions in a democratic and scientific way ; all major decisions , such as those concerning construction and development , key construction projects , and defrayal of a large amount of funds , we must act according to the principles of democratic centralism , hold collective discussions , and carefully make decisions in order to prevent what a few leaders say counts or to avoid taking hasty decisions .  
As for the affairs that can not be resolved in line with market mechanism but still need go through procedures of government examinations and approvals , we should scientifically divide powers , set up strict interactive supervisory and restraint mechanisms , and prevent a small number of people or individuals from abuse of powers .  We should improve collective policymaking mechanisms and hold collective discussions to decide the affairs that are related to the personal interests of the people strictly according to the principle of democratic centralism .  Making administrative affairs transparent is not a goal .  
In particular , in 1999 , centering on major events such as the 50th anniversary of the founding of the state , the 40th anniversary of the democratic revolution in Tibet , the Lhasa area contests of the sixth national ethnic minority games , and the reversion of Macao , the whole region carried out two major checks on the use of script in society , with the focus on Lhasa , and achieved regular , artistic , and clean use of script in society , thus displaying a good image of Tibet .  
4 ) Speed up the process of making the leading and ruling systems more scientific , democratic , and institutionalized ; perfect the supervisory mechanisms of the party , the masses , and the media so that those with the motive to commit craft can not do so .  
He indicated that , by insisting on being guided by Deng Xiaoping theory and resolutely implementing the spirit of the 15th Party Congress and various plans from the central authorities , and in keeping with the reality of their own situations , the broad cadres and masses in Heilongjiang and Jilin have struggled hard and forged ahead , producing new achievements in the promotion of economic development , the transformation of the old industrial base , Party-building , the establishment of a democratic legal system , and cultural and ideological development .  
For instance , some lack systematic study of Marxist theory ; they lack proper political sensitivity and ability to make political distinctions , lack profound understanding of the party 's fine traditions and work style , lack strict tempering in party life and awareness of democratic centralism , and lack the ability to master complex situations and resolve complex contradictions , and so on .  
Under the system of multiparty cooperation led by the CPC , the democratic parties unite and cooperate with the ruling party in exerting for the cause of building socialism .  Together , they have created a stable environment for liberating and developing the productive forces and maintaining the sustainable development of the economy , thus enabling China to make achievements of world interest in economic construction .  
Wang Zhaoguo emphasized that strengthening the training of young and middle-aged leading cadres among the democratic parties and establishing a contingent of high-caliber cadres of democratic parties is a strategic task with a vital bearing on the overall situation of multiparty cooperation , a basic guarantee for upholding and perfecting the system of multiparty cooperation and system of political consultation under the leadership of the CPC , as well as the pressing need for bringing into play the role of parties participating in the administration of state affairs and an effective measure for further realizing political handover .  
and have also played an important role in promoting a democratic and scientific policymaking process .  Facts prove that to conduct investigation and study on selected major questions of economic and social development in a planned way is a good form for the democratic parties , the Federation of Industry and Commerce and non-party personages to participate in the administration and discussion of state affairs and exercise democratic supervision ; and it is also a good way to do the united front work under the historical conditions .  
Since the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee , our Party has led the people in the unwavering promotion of reforms of the economic and political systems , establishing and promoting a socialist market economy system , developing socialist democratic politics with Chinese characteristics , and liberating and developing the social productive forces to the maximum , raising China 's overall national strength to a new level .  
In order to deepen the study and carry out in a comprehensive way Comrade Deng Xiaoping 's theory on democratic legal system and General Secretary Jiang Zemin 's important thinking of the " three represents , " the NPC Standing Committee held a study class for chairmen of the people 's congress standing committees at provincial level in Beijing from 25 to 28 September .  
He first expressed his warm welcome to the friends who have come from afar , and extended his sincere greetings and festival wishes to various democratic parties , public figures without party affiliation , personalities from various mass groups , ethnic groups , and social circles across the country , compatriots from Hong Kong , Macao , and Taiwan , and overseas Chinese .  
Now we are beginning to carry out the third-step strategy , that is , by the middle of the 21st century , China 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) per capita will reach the level of moderately developed countries , and we will basically realize modernization and build a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist country .  
Li Ruihuan stressed : The CPPCC is an important organization for political consultation , democratic supervision , and participation and deliberation in politics , and should contribute toward the formulation of the " 10th Five-Year Plan . " The CPPCC is widely representative and unique in its position ; it has a pool of qualified personnel , smooth channels , and conditions to forward good opinions and suggestions on major policies for the country .  
While concentrating our energies on achieving agricultural and rural economic development , we must really have a good grasp of the building of rural grassroots organizations , democratic legal system , and socialist spiritual civilization , maintain social stability in the rural areas , and give impetus to the rural economic and social development in a comprehensive way .  
In light of the new rural situation in the new stage , we should carry out education on the party 's basic line and rural policies , the socialist and collective spirit , the transformation of established traditions and practices , the democratic legal system , as well as science and culture .  
Only by so doing , can they better implement their sacred mission entrusted by the party and the people .  They said : In accordance with the guiding spirit of the " proposal , " we will focus on the overall construction of the armed forces , strive to push forward socialist spiritual civilization construction as well as democratic and legal construction .  
Hong Kong is a society ruled by law .  However , because of the adverse currents created by those politicians , who call themselves " democrats , " who fight China , make troubles in Hong Kong , and " overthrow Tung Chee-hwa , " this society has lost its harmony and is replete with reckless behaviors .  Currently some Legco members of the " democratic faction " have even taken the lead in violating the law and rebuffing the rule of law in our special administrative region .  
We must link the major decisions on reform and development with legislation , gradually forming decision-making mechanisms which have a deep understanding of the feelings of the people , which fully reflect the will of the people , and which concentrate the wisdom of the people in an extensive manner , promoting more scientific and democratic decision-making and improving the level and efficiency of decision-making . 
It is also necessary to speed up formulating and perfecting the laws and regulations in the areas of developing socialist democratic politics , standardizing the administrative and judicial systems , tightening the supervision over power operation , promoting the building of a clean and honest government , and so on , in a bid to push forward the political structural reform and deepen the administrative and judicial structural reforms .  
President Jiang Zemin proposed that on the basis of democratic consultation with full participation by the nations , practical international rules should be drawn up to ensure that the process of economic globalization will be able to gain correct guidance and management , advance in the direction of helping to narrow the differences between north and south and rich and poor , and help to promote world economic balance , stability , and sustainable development .  
Again , some polling stations opened earlier than scheduled , lost votes , needed a re-vote , and even found out that votes were exchanged for cigarettes , damaging the solemn election and making the democratic election undemocratic .  
Especially during the past 20 and more years since the introduction of reform and opening up , the Chinese Patriotic Catholic Association and the Chinese Catholic Bishops College have cooperated with each other closely , forged ahead in unity , assisted the party and government in implementing the policy of religious freedom , pushed forward the development of patriotic organizations , vigorously nurtured middle-aged and young patriotic clerics , actively promoted democratic management of churches , striven to adapt to socialist society , and brought about progress and development in various church undertakings by leaps and bounds .  
The leadership collective persists in pooling the united front 's strength and wisdom from all sides for the central task of economic construction , thereby forging a united , stable , invigorating , and active political situation , and spurring the constant advancement of China 's reform , opening up , and modernization drive .  The leadership collective upholds and perfects the system of multi-party cooperation led by the CPC and the system of political consultation , thereby promoting socialist democratic political construction and further strengthening the people 's democratic dictatorship and state power .  
During these five decades , the faculty of the Chinese People 's University Law School has positively participated in the state 's legislative and judicial building and made positive contributions to the country 's economic construction and social development , particularly to the political structural reform and the building of a democratic legal system .  
One , we must take a stronger mass viewpoint and forge closer party-masses relations : To uphold the mass viewpoint in rural work , it is vital that we uphold the basic aim of serving the peasants with our hearts and minds , uphold the basic criteria of protecting the peasants ' material interests and respecting the peasants ' democratic rights and privileges , and insist on the basic starting point of raising the peasants ' living standard . 
Party committees and leading cadres at various levels should take the initiative in accepting supervision by democratic parties , be glad to have their errors pointed out , and readily accept good advice ; particularly , they should listen to words or advice unpleasant to hear and be tolerant of incisive criticisms ;  
United front cadres at various levels should improve their political , theoretical , and professional qualities in an all-round way and strive to become qualified united front cadres who have a firm stand , a democratic style of work , extensive knowledge , and an innovative spirit and who are well received by friends outside the party .  
As important instruments of the people 's democratic dictatorship , it is the sacred duty of the public security organs to crack down hard on the crimes of criminal and evil forces , ensure the smooth progress of reforms , opening up , and economic construction , and ensure that the masses can live and work in peace .  
An autonomic system for community members featuring democratic election , democratic decision-making , democratic administration , and democratic supervision is gradually being formed in various experimental districts.It is necessary to transform government functions and adjust the core downward .  It is a hard nut to crack for community building , but it is a very important key link .  
We must stick to the principle that both material progress and spiritual progress should be promoted in real earnest , with neither aspect being neglected .  We must earnestly step up spiritual civilization building and democratic legal system building , vigorously develop the advanced culture , and provide the campaign to " build first-rate city " with a powerful spiritual driving force , intellectual support , and legal guarantee .  
He told this reporter : Compiled by Mao Zedong and published in the past , " Selected Works of Mao Zedong " carries Mao 's most representative works written during the period of democratic revolution , and those works have since remained in circulation throughout the world as Mao 's classic works aimed at soundly integrating Marxism with China 's revolutionary realities , and as the most basic works guiding us in learning about and studying Mao Zedong Thought for a long time to come .  
They highly praised the brilliant achievements scored in China under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , and felt elated and inspired by the sustained development of social productive forces , the continuously elevated standards of the people 's material and cultural lives , the gradual advance of the socialist democratic politics , and the excellent situation of national unity , national unification , and social stability .  
They expressed that in the new century they will fully exercise the role of the democratic parties in participating in political affairs , positively participate in the administration and discussion of the state affairs , strengthen democratic supervision , make efforts to offer advice and make suggestions , further intensify their self-construction , and work hard to build the democratic parties and the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce into high-quality parties participating in political affairs and an important mass organization of the united front suited to the requirements of the 21st century .  
Also present at the commemorative meeting were responsible officials of relevant departments of the party , government and army at the central level , representatives of democratic parties and public organizations , journalists in the capital , as well as new and veteran broadcast workers .  
Making continuous efforts to push forward the modernization drive , accomplishing the reunification of the motherland as well as safeguarding world peace , and promoting common development represent our three major historic tasks in the new century .  The tasks are also a joint work and sacred duty for all the sons and daughters of the Chinese nation , including personages of the CPC , all democratic parties , federations of industry and commerce , and personages without party affiliation .  
Also attending the meeting were leaders of the central committees of all democratic parties , federations of industry and commerce , leading cadres and personages without party affiliation , personages of ethnic and religious circles living in Beijing , and responsible persons of the units under the united front system .  A total of 300 people attended the party .  
They held that the year 2000 which just passed was a year of landmark significance in the process of development in our country , as the national economy maintained a rather rapid development speed , the building of democratic politics made steady progress , the multi-party cooperation and political consultation system was further improved , and favorable conditions were created for us to comprehensively build our country into comparatively well-off society and speed up the process of socialist modernization in the new century .  
Jiang Zemin said : Practice has proved again and again that giving full play to the positive role of the democratic parties , the federation of industrialists and businessmen , and public figures without party affiliations in the state 's economic , political , and social lives is conducive to strengthening and improving the leadership of the Communist Party , conductive to advancing socialist democratic politics , and conducive to our economic and social development and to our social stability and unity .  
By uniting in endeavor , the compatriots of both sides of the strait will certainly be able to accomplish the great cause of the motherland 's reunification at an early date , and build our common home into a rich and strong , democratic , and civilized modern nation , thus writing a still more resplendent chapter in the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation .  
Since the third plenary session of the 11th party central committee , tremendous achievements that attracted worldwide attention have been scored in China in reform , opening up , and the drive for modernization , the building of democratic legal system and spiritual civilization have been distinctly intensified , the citizens ' awareness in democratic legal system and quality of ideology and morality have been constantly elevated , and gratifying changes have taken place in social ethics and habits .  
Closely integrated with the new , historical conditions , the entire party must conscientiously put into practice the basic strategy of governing the country according to law and governing the country by ethics , always adhere to the principle of " doing two jobs at once and attaching equal importance to both , " further attach importance to and step up the building of socialist ethics while continuing to step up the building of democratic legal system .  
The responsible persons of relevant departments under central and state organs ; the responsible persons of the national committees of all democratic parties , as well as the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce ; non-party personages ; and all the representatives attending the national Science and Technology Award-giving rally as well as the representatives of the capital 's scientific and technological circles , totaling more than 3,000 people , attended the report meeting .  
It has been learned that since the Third Session of the Ninth National CPPCC Committee , CPPCC members , all democratic parties and relevant mass organizations have exercised their functions as CPPCC members by raising motions around the major issues cropping up in the course of China 's economic and social development , and the hot-point issues which the people are concerned about .  They have also actively given suggestions and offered plans and raised 3,733 motions , of which 3,372 have been filed for a record after being examined .  
He said that since the Third Session , centering on major issues in China 's economic and social development and hot issues of concern to the masses , the CPPCC members , democratic parties , and relevant popular bodies have exercised their CPPCC functions in the form of raising motions and actively contributed schemes and ideas ; altogether they have raised 3,733 motions , 3,372 of which have been placed on file , and 361 of which have been converted into members ' letters for handling .  
Representatives of central committees of various democratic parties ; All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce , nonparty personages , and China 's five major religions as well as some special committees of the CPPCC have separately held discussion meetings to roundly expose and criticize the cult essence and various crimes of the " Falungong . " They support the government 's crack down on cults in accordance with the law to eliminate public nuisance and engage in firm struggles against the " Falungong " in various ways .  
Let us rally more closely around the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , meet the requirements of the important thinking of the " three represents " in an all-round way , enhance our vigor and vitality , forge ahead in a pioneering and enterprising spirit , work in a down-to-earth manner , and exert ourselves in the struggle to achieve the goal of the 10th Five-year Plan and build an affluent , strong , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country !  
Practice has proven that adhering to and perfecting the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the communist party and strengthening the CPC 's close cooperation with all democratic parties and friends from all quarters is of important significance to reinforcing and developing the great solidarity and great alliance , promoting the development of our common cause , and achieving lasting order and stability in the country .  
Firstly , it requires party committees and leading cadres with party membership at all levels to further enhance their ideological understanding , fully recognize the superiority of this basic political system of our country , gain a deep understanding of the distinct features of China 's political party system , study and acquire knowledge of the glorious history of our party cooperating with democratic parties , and enhance their consciousness in cooperating with democratic parties .  
He said : We must work together with Taiwan compatriots to jointly inherit and foster the outstanding Chinese cultural traditions , promote cross-strait exchange in the cultural and other fields , and make continuous efforts to jointly build our homeland into an affluent , strong , democratic , and civilized modern country .  
In its great practice of leading the masses to build up socialist modernizations , from reinforcing and perfecting the system of people 's congress and the system of people 's political consultative conference to introducing democracy of a most extensive scope to the basic level , the party is making constant efforts to strengthen and perfect the country 's socialist democratic system .  
This is a major and effective move which is adopted on the basis of both China 's national conditions and its practical situation , and which aims to speed up the process of socialist democracy .  From the agrarian reform to the introduction of a household-based contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output and from the election of people 's deputies to the introduction of villagers ' self-rule , all have given an expression to the democratic practice that is being carried out by millions upon millions of people under the leadership of the party .  
Zhang Deguang said : Over more than 20 years since the beginning of reform and opening up , the building of a democratic legal system has been strengthened constantly in our country , which has promoted the establishment of a socialist market economic system .  The thinking of governing the country by law has won support from the people .  
At the same time , the CPPCC must also strengthen ties with the party 's discipline inspection organs , state power organs , administrative supervisory organs , and judicial organs , cooperate with supervision by the media and other forms of mass supervision , and work in concert with all sides to promote the active , steady , sound , and effective progress of the CPPCC 's democratic supervision .  
he key to " raising the quality of procuratorial personnel " is to strengthen the development of leading bodies .  Poor-quality , indolent , and problematic leading bodies should be promptly readjusted , while leading procuratorial bodies at the provincial and municipal level should be gradually staffed by democratic party members and nonparty personages .  
The session called on the people of all ethnic groups in the country to rally closely around the party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core , hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory , uphold the party 's basic line , use the important " three represents " thinking as a guidance , explore ways to advance , do solid work , and strive with one mind to implement the 10th Five-Year Plan and build China into a prosperous , democratic , and civilized socialist modern country !  
Making suggestions on the medium - and long-term plans for national economic and social development is an effective mode of our party 's work in guiding economic construction , and also a concrete embodiment of the party 's system of democratic centralism in making major policy decisions .  
Indeed , people across the country are satisfied with the tremendous achievements made by the current government in developing the economy , improving the people 's livelihood and the democratic legal system , and opposing corruption and promoting clean government .  This is clearly reflected in the high appraisal and warm praise of Premier Zhu 's report expressed by participants in the NPC session and the session of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference .  
Under the guidance of this principle , the Chinese Government has implemented active measures , enhanced democracy at the grass-roots level , comprehensively carried out administration according to law , energetically developed judicial reform , raised the quality of law enforcement personnel , increased the degree of transparency in judicial matters , augmented supervision over law enforcement , severely punished graft and corruption in accordance with law , and achieved a series of positive progressions in completing the democratic legal system .  
The Chief Executive , Mr Tung Chee Hwa , said today ( September 10 , US time ) he has held ' very meaningful and engaging ' discussions on Hong Kong 's future democratic evolution and economic development with key political and business leaders in the US capital .  
These energetic and keen VRAs not only help register eligible voters who may otherwise be left out of the electoral roll for one reason or another .  They are also spreading the message of civic education .  This is the perfect exercise for introducing our young people to the democratic process , and to help them develop a true sense of belonging and commitment to Hong Kong , their home , " she said .  
Officiating at a ceremony to launch the New Territories East District Councils election publicity campaign in Cycle Park , Tai Wai , Mr Lan said , " The coming District Councils election will provide all eligible voters with a golden opportunity to partake in our democratic process by directly electing the candidates of their choice to represent them to deal with many public issues that would have a direct impact on their daily lives . "  
' The method for selecting the Chief Executive shall be specified in the light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress .  The ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures . '  
The method for selecting the Chief Executive shall be specified in the light of the actual situation in the HKSAR and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress .  The ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures .  
They were very happy to have the opportunity to observe the congress in session . They were particularly excited by the revolutionary stand of the Kuomintang in the adopted party platform , pledging itself to remain in the democratic camp , and to unite all the people 's strength from at home and abroad , as well as from behind the enemy lines , for the final victory of national recovery against the Communists .  
Premier Sun informed the participants that in handling " this regrettable affair , " the government has been most concerned , and has carefully followed the rule of protecting the innocent and punishing the guilty . The incident has in no way affected the central administration 's determination to implement democratic and constitutional government .  
The Republic of China is a law-abiding nation and as such does not in any way support or approve of illegal behavior . What must be considered in this case is that it is the autocratic , repressive regime on the mainland that so relentlessly controls all aspects of life , denying the basic human rights that are enjoyed in democratic countries that literally forced the six to use these means to seek their escape .  
From a humanitarian standpoint , it is this earnest desire to lead a life in a free , democratic society that has earned the people 's sympathy . Finally after one year , three months and one week the six patriots finally realized the fulfillment of their long cherished dream - - their sentences were suspended and they were allowed to go to their homeland , the Republic of China .  
Generally , after the rise of a middle class , a society 's expectations of its government are raised , so that the public of an advanced democratic nation is often evenly divided in its satisfaction with government performance , and a seventy or eighty percent satisfaction rate like some of ours is no longer easily attained .  
The late President Chiang Ching-kuo , who boldly strove to promote democratic , constitutional government and march down the road of liberalization , left unfulfilled aspirations behind . At a time when our nation faces dramatic changes in its economic and political situations , how will President Lee fuse the conservative and reform forces , adapt to domestic and foreign trends , and lead the nation along the road to advancement ? The question is not a small one .  
A democratic government has been the goal which China has been long searching for in recent years , but after the Chinese Communists ' abrupt rise , the value of this democratic theory which is applicable everywhere has been muddled and its role confused under the fighting among the political parties of China .  
He proposed that the cabinet selection process should not become a sensitive political question , suggesting instead that it is a question of " political management " and that cabinet changes are a normal state of affairs in advanced democratic countries . From July ninth to the twelfth , committees met to discuss proposals on thought and ideology , the party platform and policies , reform of party affairs , and mainland policy , which concerned the future of party and national politics . The sound of " quicken reform " was heard in every committee .  
On the other hand , however , objective social and economic conditions , the establishment of a democratic model for the populace , and the promotion of rational behavior are especially essential to democracy . As the focus of public attention , members of the Legislative Yuan will undoubtedly have an effect on society and determine whether the ROC succeeds in democratic reforms .  
In order to help pass these bills as early as possible and secure the promotion of constitutional democratic government , Government Information Office Director-General Shaw Yu-ming held a special seminar . Specialists and scholars who had neither a hand in making up the bills nor were already opposed were asked to discuss these bills from a relatively fair , objective angle , in the hopes of raising public awareness and contributing toward a consensus .  
It can not be denied , however , that the development of various aspects of society has brought about a number of problems that have not as yet been completely solved . For example , the adjustment of the adaptability of various government systems has not yet been completed , traditional rules of politics have been subject to strong attack , and the behavior standards of a democratic society have not yet been firmly established , leading to incidents of anomie and disorder .  
If both the government and the people adhere to the established policies of political democratization , economic liberalization , societal pluralization , and cultural sinification ; if they speed the development of democratic politics and maintain stable economic growth ; and if they progress in related social and cultural respects - - all this will mean that all sectors in our nation will develop in a balanced way and forge ahead jointly .  
Fellow Countrymen , Distinguished Guests : Over two thousand years ago , Chinese culture gave birth to the ideal of a great world commonwealth of peace and prosperity . The political , economic , and social systems and goals that it entails are in full accord with those implemented and sought by modern free and democratic nations .  
We sincerely hope that during this generation , we can establish a political model of democratic rule of law , to lay the foundation for a prosperous and equitable economic system and to create a peaceful , happy , trusting , and harmonious society .  
Taiwan is still in a transitional period , moving toward a democratic progressive society . So there are still some awkward phenomena , and not only among civil servants - - the party consciousness of all people is still quite deep . It will take time and a good civil service system to build up the concept and image of administrative neutrality .  
Data indicates that if the mainland authorities launch an attack on Taiwan regardless of internal democratic opposition and the cost in casualties - - one third to one quarter of their combined forces manpower - - then they have three possible options for military action : The first is attacking the islands one by one , starting with Kinmen , Matsu and the Pescadores , at the same time using their air and sea dominance , and missiles , to strike military , political and economic targets on Taiwan itself .  
Elders Also Receive a Baptism in the New Tide : At the end of 1989 , the Kuomintang implemented a party primary system to determine nominees , which fit better with the democratic spirit . The number of seats occupied by women suddenly shot up , with fourteen women among the 101 supplementary legislators ( one of whom has since left to take a cabinet position ) .  
Today Taiwan has become famous around the globe as one of the Four Little Dragons of Asia , while the mainland has shocked the world with the bloody suppression at Tienanmen . China has entered an unprecedented historical period . In a rapidly changing international situation , with close economic and trade ties across the Taiwan Strait , we in Taiwan must squarely face the chaos and disorder appearing in society during a transitional period of democratic constitutional reform .  
In the free democratic societies that have mostly replaced authoritarian societies , the upper level is formed from the middle level and the middle level from the lower level . No one 's position is permanently occupied , and there are no strong authoritarian forces blocking interaction and communication . Mutual understanding is n't difficult .  
Besides a strong legislature , with the development of democratic politics , various interest groups are both " numerous and vocal " with their opinions . For example , there were endless disputes over land acquisition and the proposed routes of transportation projects , which all affected the pace of the projects . This caused the foreign firms who were anxious to get their orders settled to have to wait off to the side chomping at the bit .  
When , in 1989 , the Chinese Communists committed the horrendous atrocity of the Tienanmen massacre in full view of the world 's media , Western governments were finally roused from their dreaming . The last threads of the illusion they had built up concerning the movement of China 's communist authorities towards democracy were broken . In stark contrast , the liberalization and process of political normalization on this side of the Taiwan Strait led the West to begin to accept the ROC as a member of the democratic camp . "  
As society has become democratic and diverse , corruption , which previously few people learned about , is now being spotlighted by the media and legislators . The bidding for the huge contracts of the major construction projects that have followed in the wake of Taiwan 's affluence are said to be fertile ground for illegal linkages of private money and government power . With corruption frequently in the news , popular sentiment has boiled over and the Ministry of Justice is drawing up an anti-corruption plan called " Taking the Knife to Corruption . "  
Although Taiwan practices democratic politics , bureaucratic corruption also exists ; Taiwan 's economy is relatively advanced , but suffers the vital weaknesses of scarce resources and over-reliance on others ; the people of Taiwan have quite a high standard of living , yet there are still classes which rely on welfare payments to make ends meet ; Taiwan has been quite deeply influenced by Western culture , yet still maintains traditional Chinese culture and traditional Confucian thinking , family values and even our ancient culinary culture , all of which spring from a common source .  
The challenge inside the systemPerhaps in Taiwan the democratic climate has not reached maturity , yet the administrative system , originally closed and operating from the top downward , has opened a door to the outside . In the past two or three years , reform groups have been commissioned by the government in some areas , and more and more have begun to be incorporated within the parameters of the system .  
Robert Hum is not worried by this concern . He says : " We are pursuing our interests legally within a democratic system . " But Manying Ip , an influential member of the Chinese community , believes that although the high-profile approach of organizing a party to fight for one 's own right to be heard appears very positive in the short term , a party based mainly on ethnicity has a narrow platform , and she fears that it will not last in the long term .  
Second , Lu Hsiu-lien offered strong personal credentials : a strong academic record , a clean and fresh image , a background as a leader in the women 's movement , and her imprisonment as an early democratic activist back in the early 1980s . She also showed a far-reaching boldness for running the county for " four years and nine months " ( i.e . the nine-month replacement term plus an expected victory in the regular year-end contest ) .  
But in regard to this question , the international community wants the cross-strait problem to be resolved peacefully . Though most countries accept the " one China " principle , and recognize the mainland regime as its representative , Taiwan 's democratic development and economic efforts have drawn great international attention and affirmation . In particular , Taiwan 's stability during the recent financial turmoil in Southeast Asia is evidence that Taiwan plays a critical role in ensuring the economic prosperity and regional security of East Asia .  
A : For a long time now , our government has been plainly telling the Communist Chinese authorities that our final goal is a free , democratic , and prosperous reunified China . But before reunification , the ROC must continue to seek survival and development in international society . This is the basic right of survival of the people living in the Taiwan area . And this can create a model for the Chinese on both sides to pursue a better future way of life and system .  
Another of his major contributions was democratic reforms . In 1987 , martial law was abolished in Taiwan , various bans were lifted , and Taiwanese were for the first time allowed to visit relatives in Mainland China . These new policies firmly set the path toward fundamental democratic reform ; what followed was a praiseworthy " peaceful revolution . "  
In later years , although Taiwan had made tremendous progress relative to its situation 25 years before , the difficulties it faced in raising funds overseas were proportional to those it faced in surviving internationally , and this created more problems for the center . Moreover , domestically , the island was entering the democratic era . Most citizens , including the legislators who held the purse-strings , did n't understand the importance of the center and its contribution to the world . Consequently , the budget was cut repeatedly .  
Wang , who studied in the West for many years , and who says that there is only a single universal standard of press freedom , recalls that when the ROC government first moved to Taiwan , it was facing a life-or-death crisis . Putting the regime 's survival first , it set aside notions of balance and press oversight inherent in democratic politics and argued that the media had to serve the state in order to ensure stability and the public interest .  
ROC president Lee Teng-hui , himself the focus of much media attention , mentioned in his opening address that throughout ten years of promoting democratic reforms , he has always understood the significance of freedom and liberalization of the mass communications industry . It is a constant motivating force for democratic political development . In the future , the ROC will continue to practically implement and fully realize such essential components of civilization as democracy , freedom and human rights , striving in concert with others to achieve the goal of global press freedom .  
Chiu says : " To build a high-quality democracy , the first thing is to create a healthy political party system , and the second is to improve people 's understanding and practice of democratic habits . Unfortunately , Taiwan has not done well in either of these respects . " People who are today over 30 , having grown up under the martial law education system , lack any concept of political checks and balances , are short on the ability to make autonomous judgments , and have poor democratic ethics .  
The narrowing of international space in turn sparked the rise of " nativist ideology " in Taiwan-nascent Taiwanese nationalism . Now that Taiwan is free , democratic , and prosperous , the old policy of refusing to coexist in the international community with mainland China has been abandoned , and the government hopes to create a " win-win " situation . But mainland China still has the mindset from the civil war half a century ago .  
How can people make a wise choice among the many value systems on offer ? How can they monitor their new leader to ensure that Taiwan has a peaceful future free of the influence of " black gold politics " ? These are not only questions for this election , but eternal challenges for the whole people in any democratic society .  
In response to these doubts , Chen Shui-bian stressed that Tang 's achievements in reforming the military during his tenure as minister of national defense were plain for all to see , and his enlightened working style and democratic approach were fully in accord with the principles of inclusive , clean government . Taiwan needed stability in which to pursue reform and progress , develop its economy and assure its national defense capability , and Tang was the best choice to bring this about .  
When Lee Teng-hui took office he successfully promoted democratization , yet only as far as the introduction of direct presidential elections . On the other hand , public order deteriorated , the democratic culture failed to take firm root , and ethnic tensions became exacerbated . Furthermore , the black gold problem grew worse and Taiwan was pushed to the brink of war with the mainland .  
Apart from consolidating democratic achievements , promoting government reforms , and raising economic competitiveness , the new government should , as its foremost objective , closely watch public opinion and implement reforms accordingly , so that the people on this land can live with more dignity , greater self-confidence and a better quality of life .  
At the same time , however , it seems clear that after the first transfer of power between political parties ever to take place in the 55 years since the Republic of China moved its capital to Taiwan , both the ruling and opposition parties are still learning how to play their proper roles . Taiwan 's democratic system will gradually mature amidst the unprecedented political changes taking place today in Taiwan .  
Putting high hopes on this election , four days before the vote President Chen Shui-bian put forward five main principles for his proposed " National Security Alliance " : to agree on national identity , achieve a breakthrough in cross-strait relations , promote democratic reforms , spark economic development , and eliminate social and political cleavages . He had hoped to achieve a consensus on these points between ruling and opposition parties .  
Instead she committed herself to the struggle for freedom , human rights and democracy . After the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident , she supported her husband Chen Shui-bian in embarking on a political career ; a decade later , when Chen was arrested , she won election to the legislature . She later helped her husband to victory in the 2000 presidential elections . Wu had shown an abiding commitment to democratic reform , and had earned a special place in the history of Taiwan 's democratization .  
Right now the Executive Yuan is planning to issue a set of administrative regulations to provide the basis for public referenda of a consultative , non-binding nature . But administrative regulations can not replace proper legislation produced through democratic processes . Although a referendum itself can be seen as the ultimate expression of democracy , unless the law is amended soon , simply taking shortcuts and implementing the administrative regulations could cause anti-nuclear forces to lose the legitimacy that comes from democratic action , which could lead to a constitutional crisis down the road .  
In terms of agreement , both sides realize that although democratic government is essentially " representative government , " duly elected representatives and officials are sometimes unable to carry out fully and impartially the duties entrusted to them by the electorate . To correct the insufficiencies of " indirect democracy " one must thus rely on the " direct democracy " of the popular referendum . This is an important element in the deepening and reform of the democratic process .  
It is just that the popular will is like " flowing water " - it is changeable , now going one way , now another . In today 's Taiwan , where there is still plenty of room for improvement in democratic institutions and where there still exist great differences on the question of national identity , both sides must proceed cautiously . Only in this way will they truly be able to seize the moment and usher in real political reform and a deepening of the democratic process .  
In former times , the emperor had the final say in how urban spaces were organized , and all buildings took the imperial palace as their yardstick . In the democratic era , citizens have formed a close relationship with public spaces , giving them a key role . Public spaces afford people the most immediate aesthetic awareness of their environment . "  
" the goal of this revolution is to further liberate and develop the productive forces , and to turn our underdeveloped socialist country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , culturally advanced and modern socialist country , and that will demonstrate the superiority of socialism in china , " jiang said

" Respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in civil , political , economic , social and cultural matters , as well as democratic values exemplified by free and regular elections ;  
As you can see , Tajikistan 's leaders , notwithstanding the enormous pressure of political , social and economic problems , are holding fast to their chosen course of constructing a truly democratic and secular State based on the rule of law .  
It is essential that the parties continue rigourously to observe the rules of the democratic game by unequivocally accepting the outcome of the elections once these have been declared free and fair by the international community . 
The interconnection between the effective functioning of the political system , in a lawful and efficient manner , and the maintenance of human rights is a crucial matter on which the democratic future of El Salvador largely depends .

The subject was of the utmost importance , for political as well as technical reasons , since the development of a modern transport infrastructure was crucial to the success of the region 's democratic and economic transformation .  
In 1948 , at the end of a civil war in my country which had as its main goal the defence of democratic institutions and the re-establishment of an electoral regime which assured respect for the popular vote , the victors , instead of using arms as a means to stay in power , decided to abolish the armed forces .  
We should not be surprised that freely electing over 2,000 local and national officials in the poorest , least educated , most politically volatile nation in the Western Hemisphere a country without adequate roads , electricity , administrators or democratic tradition should prove to be such a daunting task .  
We should also stress the support of friendly countries directly interested in the region , particularly those that have cooperated , and continue to cooperate , with the Secretary-General in the search for political solutions , and those that have provided technical and financial assistance for the implementation of special programmes of cooperation designed to supplement the peace efforts by attacking the structural causes of our problems and strengthening the democratic process . 
This is equally true in the economic and social sphere , and with regard to the constant modernization and honing of democratic institutions , governance , control of the exercise of political power , full and absolute respect for human rights and the daily exercise of such rights and obligations on the part both of those who govern and of those who are governed .  
But this sharing of experience and this programme of cooperation , as pointed out in the Managua Declaration and the Plan of Action , must transcend the sphere of conceptual criteria and value judgements on the democratic system and freedom , as opposed to totalitarian and authoritarian regimes , of the left or of the right , fundamentalist or religious , or merely the result of military or populist ambitions . 
New democracies virtually everywhere are confronting the common challenge of ensuring the peaceful processes of political transformation , the establishment and consolidation of internal democratic institutions and norms , and structural readjustment accompanied by socially oriented economic transformations backed up by a system of measures and guarantees for social justice in society .  
It is the United Nations which , not limiting itself to those classical human rights born of the American and the French revolutions , consecrated the fundamental rights of the second generation and , in particular , economic , social and cultural rights which allowed it to enrich the contribution of liberalism of the century of enlightenment through the contribution of democratic socialism of the nineteenth century .  
Today I am happy to be able to tell the international community that my country completed instituting its democratic republican institutions in June this year when we organized our multiparty legislative and municipal elections .  
We feel political and economical closeness to the West , and we are aware of the unique historical opportunity to join the prosperous union of democratic European countries .  
Furthermore , Thailand is convinced that one must also ensure that the United Nations of the twenty-first century is more equitable , representative , democratic , transparent and accountable , allowing for the widest possible participation in all its decision-making and activities and serving the interests of all mankind .  When speaking of these qualities , one is inclined to ponder the work on the reform of the Security Council .  
It is thus an important duty of the international community to promote democracy among and within States by helping them to build a democratic system ; by providing them with logistical and technical support for the organization of free elections ; by promoting the creation of a public sector to guarantee the proper management of State affairs ; and by providing the various sectors of civil society with the resources to consolidate the bases of democracy .  
We also need to reinforce the capacity of the United Nations to assist Member States in their efforts to improve democratic structures , including the holding of free and fair elections , the full observance of human rights , the rights of minorities and fundamental freedoms , the strengthening of the rule of law , the fostering of popular participation and accountability of Governments , and the development of a prosperous civil society .  
The difficulties involved in meeting , living together and working as equals in an atmosphere of tolerance and cooperation can not conceal the important contribution being made today by the leaders of that Republic under the inspiring leadership of President Mandela , to whom we wish to accord a special recognition for having constructed the democratic foundations of a multiracial and multicultural nation , fully incorporated into the international community . 
At the very heart of this Programme is the acknowledgement of the inextricable interdependence between the need for transparent , accountable and democratic governance of our society and the imperative of dynamic economic growth and sustainable development .  
We are a nation deeply committed to the proper functioning of democratic institutions , having attained a commendable political stability in our continent 's community of nations .  
In our domestic policy we have had two main priorities : to develop and consolidate the legal and institutional framework of a State of law and the smooth functioning of institutions appropriate to a modern democratic society on the one hand , and , on the other , to ensure economic restructuring and the transition to a market economy .  
However , despite these endeavours and despite my Government 's resolve to secure fundamental freedoms for our people on a firm foundation , foreign interests , for their own unavowed purposes , want to see the democratic process in my country shaped as the saying is in the image and likeness of those alien interests .  
Beyond your qualifications , Mr . President , as Prime Minister , Minister or Head of a democratic party posts that you have occupied or still occupy I am sure it was your standing as an academic , intellectual and man of culture that first and foremost determined that choice .  
The global order can no longer be based solely on the special position of the anti-fascist coalition or the nuclear club , or on economic or military power ; rather , first and foremost , it should be based on the real contribution of individual countries to the prevention of every form of totalitarianism and to the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; on their role within global socio-economic development ; on their democratic achievement ; and on their regional importance .  
There are still many obstacles to overcome in the political , economic and social spheres and in the quest of the international community for a more just , equitable , secure , peaceful and democratic world .  
It will never be possible to achieve this peace unless the national policies of the strongest and most powerful countries are promptly transformed into positive action towards democratic consolidation , leading , certainly , to economic globalization , but also to political and social globalization ; ensuring economic growth , but growth with a human and a social face , enabling poor countries to attain the true independence and sovereign equality to which we are all fully entitled .  
We have moved from an authoritarian Central America divided by war to a democratic and united Central America which today is building its future through a regional alliance for sustainable development .  
The Revolutionary Youth Movement to which the youth of Syria belong is an organizational framework and an educational forum for young people through which Syria 's youth exercise their its democratic rights , elect their political leaderships , practice their hobbies and defend their interests at all levels : the educational , social , economic , vocational , cultural , touristic , athletic , artistic , informational , ideological , political and technical .  
Riera Escudero ( Paraguay ) ( interpretation from Spanish ) : The Republic of Paraguay , which has a long history of authoritarian Governments , has enjoyed full civil and political freedoms for more than six years now , as part of a democratic process which , slowly but surely , is being consolidated and strengthened , with the consensus of a noble , peace-loving and hard-working people that makes daily sacrifices in order to build a better future for its children . 
In fact , although the changes that took place in the wake of the cold war led to a certain easing in international relations and promoted , as never before , democratic values , the international situation nevertheless has continued to deteriorate in recent times in the political , economic , social and financial spheres .  
These are some of the reasons that justify a rapprochement between Governments and the national olympic committees , and , moreover , that between the United Nations and the International Olympic Committee , with the objective of achieving democratic societies made up of citizens who are active in their defence of close and lasting human relations .  
Throughout the gradual transition , the summit meetings of the Central American Presidents have institutionalized the process of regional integration and have given concrete form to the commitments undertaken in Esquipulas II , in which Central America pledged to struggle for peace and eradicate war , to ensure that dialogue prevailed over violence and reason over rancour , to give impetus to real democratic processes , and to promote justice and respect for human rights . 
Today we can say that in the 1990s , with the end of the cold war and the breakdown of totalitarianism , an unprecedented opportunity presented itself to change the course of history and , for the first time , to secure the values of a democratic , just , peaceful , civil and reconciled society , with Governments brought to power by the freely expressed will of the people .  
The world community must continue to afford effective assistance to the Central American countries in averting new outbreaks of tension , in ensuring that the processes of national reconciliation in the subregion are irreversible by creating solid democratic bases for State structures , in strengthening the climate of political tolerance , in the strict observance of human rights , and in their economic recovery .  
The representative and participatory democratic model has been enriched , contributing to overcoming substantial political and social tensions characteristic of the establishment of a state of law and the perfecting of democratic institutions , through economic and social harmonization and the constant search for a political consensus . 
On 4 July 1995 , as the culmination of a long period of national debate between the executive and legislative organs of the Government , the political parties and civil society , the reforms approved to the 1987 political Constitution were published through the promulgation of a framework law which for the first time in our history establishes the mechanisms for a real commitment to democratic governability .  
In this respect , it must be emphasized that a solid democratic and pluralistic system , based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and in the covenants and international conventions on human rights , is closely linked to the implementation of policies aimed at promoting sustainable development , improving the standard of living of the lowest-income segments of society , and promoting civil and political freedoms and equality of opportunities . 
Well-structured , effective , mutually independent and collaborative State institutions , an equitable political system , a harmonized legal system , overall security and economic prosperity all form the basis of a democratic State .  
As one of the 14 founder members , India looks forward to participating in all its activities , aimed at promoting and advancing democracy , improving and consolidating electoral processes , strengthening and supporting national capacity to develop the full range of democratic instruments , and promoting transparency and accountability in the context of democratic development .  
Pluralism is essential to the transition to a democratic government , but in a larger sense encompassing periodic elections , the accountability of public officials , a transparent public administration , an independent judiciary and a free press .  
Fifthly , sharing democratic values is of crucial importance for the political , economic and social processes in national societies , as well as for international peace and security .  
The national euphoria resulting from the overthrow of a tyrannic dictatorship or from a deliberate choice , through legal processes , to change a form of government is , in most cases , as we have observed in the last few years , soon dissipated by a realization that making a democracy work is not as easy as proclaiming a democratic Government .  
But the rather widespread expression of a sincere desire to make the Security Council more effective , more transparent , more legitimate and more democratic are coming up against the fact that this exercise brings together States which are pursuing contradictory perhaps even irreconcilable goals .  
In the economic sphere , the implementation of the emergency and national reconstruction programme has given way to the creation of medium - and long-term programmes aimed at promoting wide democratic participation and eradicating the structural causes of the conflict , mainly social inequalities and extreme poverty .  
Indonesia , along with the other non-aligned countries , has consistently emphasized that if the United Nations is to become a fully effective central instrument in a new and revitalized international order , reflecting the new realities of the international situation , it should be based on and truly reflect the democratic spirit of equality , equity and transparency , in representation as well as in the decision-making processes .  
Only when the United Nations has a representative , democratic and transparent Security Council that maintains the proper relationship with the General Assembly and that makes correct use of the powers entrusted to it by Member States will we have a truly effective Security Council ; only then will the United Nations be able to meet the demands and challenges of the future .  
Although there may still be many difficulties and challenges along the road ahead , we are confident that , through several generations of hard work , our people will lift China out of economic and cultural backwardness and turn it into a highly prosperous and democratic modern country .  
The New Partnerships Initiative ( NPI ) announced by the Vice-President at the Social Summit emphasizes work at the local level to build sustainable institutional capacity in three areas non-governmental organization empowerment across sectors , small - business partnerships and democratic local governance as well as efforts at the national level to ensure a supportive policy , regulatory and resource environment for private and community action .  
Mindful of the acuteness of the problem , which has taken on global dimensions and which could call into question the democratic achievements of this decade , the international community , at these major conferences over the last five years , has tried to find a collective and global response that would emphasize an integrated development approach , reflecting its multidimensional aspects .  
Thus , from the outset , CARICOM States have attached the highest importance to achieving the basic goals of the international community , which are reaffirmed in the resolution before us ; in particular , restoration of democratic order in Haiti , including the full observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms , and the promotion of economic and social development .  
In this context , the continued support of the United Nations system and the international community , which is recognized in this draft resolution , will be critical in providing the people of Haiti with a second chance to secure a democratic future , in which their political and development aspirations can be fulfilled .  
In this regard , it is essential for African countries themselves to promote sustainable development and greater political stability through , inter alia , State structures adapted to the new realities , the establishment of democratic political systems , a responsible and transparent management of public affairs , and respect and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
An end to military rivalry , foreign occupation and feelings of racial superiority would be conducive to a world free of poverty and injustice , in which relationships would become more democratic , humane and stable .  
Conditions must be created for the holding of free , fair and direct elections , in accordance with the highest democratic standards and respect for the sovereignty , territorial integrity and political independence of Bosnia and Herzegovina and for the rights of all ethnic and religious groups .  
Furthermore , the exercise of such rights was not possible in the absence of political freedom , and their protection required States to adopt democratic practices , practices which must inevitably bring benefits since people who were free to think , exchange ideas and invest their own energies and capital would be able to contribute more to economic and social development than people stunted by repression .  
Algeria was aware that the promotion and protection of human rights and democratic principles were primarily the responsibility of Governments , and it assigned a prominent place to those rights and principles in its project for the construction of a modern State based on republican principles and on the alternation of political power .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism and criminal acts , as well as illegal drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
A number of areas of common interest and joint action in human rights were identified , including the question of minorities , preventive action , fact-finding missions , seminars and training , advisory services and technical assistance , particularly with respect to constitutional and legal reform , democratic elections , the administration of justice and the strengthening of infrastructures for the promotion and protection of human rights .  
Now , 20 years later , almost 40 per cent of the territory of Cyprus , a sovereign , independent , democratic State and a Member of the United Nations , remained under occupation , and gross and massive violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms continued to be committed there .  
Noting with satisfaction the holding of free and democratic elections in El Salvador , the progress made towards fulfilment of the outstanding commitments assumed under the Peace Agreement , the political will consistently expressed by the signatories thereto and the support of the various Salvadorian political forces for accelerating the resolution of crucial outstanding issues , which is essential to promote reconciliation and maintain and consolidate peace in El Salvador ,  
We are now in the process of developing permanent mechanisms for preventive diplomacy and collective security based on a regional commitment to a system of shared democratic values .  
The informal cooperation that now exists on security issues in the region and the conclusion of more formal economic cooperation arrangements have contributed significantly towards building confidence in the prospect of a more secure , democratic and prosperous future for southern Africa .  
Implement at the national level structural adjustment policies , which should include social development goals , and effective development strategies that establish a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resource development and further promote the development of democratic institutions ;  
It requires democratic institutions , respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , increased and equal economic opportunities , the rule of law , promotion of respect for cultural diversity and rights of persons belonging to minorities and an active involvement of the civil society .  
Such an inclusive society must be based upon respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice and special needs of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups , democratic participation and the rule of law .  
Although the democratic Government had been elected by a sizable majority , opposition forces had controlled the Senate because it included nine senators appointed by the outgoing military regime .  
The successful peaceful transition of South Africa to a democratic and non-racial society with human rights safeguarded by an entrenched Charter of Fundamental Rights has nevertheless left cultural , economic and social inequalities reflecting historical deprivation .  
The senior officials of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Russia and Uzbekistan , supporting the efforts of the leadership of Tajikistan to carry out democratic reforms , stressed the special importance in that connection of the forthcoming parliamentary elections and the need for them to be held in accordance with democratic norms , on a multiparty basis , and to ensure the widest possible participation of the various political forces .  
My Government wishes to reaffirm that the Lusaka Protocol signals the beginning of a decisive step towards the definitive solution to the Angolan internal conflict , by establishing a unique opportunity for eliminating completely the threat of renewed war .  At the same time , it has paved the way for the normal functioning of the democratic institutions that emerged from the multi-party elections , which both the United Nations and the international community declared to be free and fair .  
The brother African country of Angola , long the victim of an unrelenting civil war and of enormously lethal events , has just provided eloquent proof that it is always possible to reconcile warring brothers who want to bury the hatchet the better to work together to build a peaceful , democratic and prosperous nation .  
Mrs . BEZLEPKINA ( Russian Federation ) said that during the period of reorientation resulting from Russia 's adoption of democratic values and ideals the country 's internal resources were strained and its people were struggling with a falling standard of living .  The transition to a market economy was being hampered by social and psychological inertia .  
In order to reverse this trend , the country must satisfy one major condition , a political condition : it must conduct free , transparent and democratic elections and take subsequent measures to establish a constitutional State .  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
They also shared the view that steps could be taken to facilitate the early conclusion of negotiations on complex substantive issues that are yet to be considered , namely " economic and social issues and the agrarian situation " , " strengthening of civilian power and role of the army in a democratic society " and " constitutional reforms and electoral regime " .  
The revised timetable provides for completion of two main substantive issues ( economic and social issues and the agrarian situation ; and strengthening of civilian power and role of the army in a democratic society ) before the electoral campaign is fully under way .  
A noteworthy example of the effective facilitative role by UNDP is that played in support of the democratic transition process , which extended to providing the Government , political parties and pressure groups as well as donors with a neutral forum for dialogue .  
A society for all is seen as an inclusive society which must be based upon respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , cultural and religious diversity , social justice , democratic participation and the rule of law .  
Together with the constitutional and legislative reforms established by the peace agreements , the creation of a new and efficient system for the administration of justice calls for the programming and implementation of measures to modernize and raise the professional standards of the judiciary , which , in keeping with the new democratic legality that supports it , would make it possible for new judicial practices to become firmly entrenched . 
Economic and social development , democratic consolidation and the promotion and protection of human rights all require a strong , rational and predictable legal system for their effective implementation .  
In many Latin American countries , the paradox of overabundant legislation and overemphasized democracy contrasting with the fragmentation of society , deep economic inequalities and the low level of political participation suggests that the ruling \ x { 5e68 } ite is attempting to overcome the weak integration of society by developing the legal framework of a democratic state of law addressing the whole people .  
Its main functions include : ( a ) processing the dissemination of human rights as an effective means of guaranteeing their observance and consolidating the democratic system , ( b ) cooperating with relevant institutions to promote the teaching of human rights at the primary , secondary and university levels and in non-formal education and ( c ) promoting the alignment of domestic legislation with international agreements and treaties on human rights .  
The Code , reaffirming the continuing validity of the comprehensive concept of security , set politically binding norms and principles guiding the role of armed forces in democratic societies and the relation , among States as well as the relations of States vis - - vis their nationals in the military field .  
On the other hand , the memorandum of understanding confirmed the principle of respect for and defence of the democratic model contained in the Constitution , obliging each to recognize the popular will expressed through universal suffrage as the sole and exclusive way to maintain and obtain political power . 
This action by the international community , showing itself to be unequivocally in favour of democratic law in Sao Tome and Principe and of scrupulous respect for democratically elected sovereign organs , represented not only an invaluable contribution to the positive conclusion of the crisis in Sao Tome and Principe , but also en example to be followed in all similar instances in any part of the world .  
Croatia 's views stem from its geo-strategic position and its political , economic , technological and cultural features , and are thus closely linked to its long-term strategic interests , including a political settlement to the crisis in the region as a precondition for democratic and independent development .  
NULLIn its resolution 1995 / 52 of 3 March 1995 on the situation of human rights in Togo , the Commission , inter alia , welcomed the fact that Togo had set out on the road to democratic political change , and urged all Togolese to respect the outcome of the parliamentary elections held in February 1994 and to ensure the effective functioning of the democratically elected parliament .  
What remains , as the Central American Presidents declared during their sixteenth summit meeting , held at Cerro Verde , El Salvador , from 29 to 31 March 1995 , is " the urgent need to strengthen the peace processes in Central America and thus to guarantee the stability and security which are essential to consolidation of the democratic order and the economic and social development of our peoples " ( A / 49 / 901-S / 1995 / 396 , annex I ) .  
That the social situation has not seriously endangered the democratic process is due , in part , to the strong tradition of organization and social discipline of the Nicaraguan people , reinforced by the fact that the Nicaraguan poor , especially small and mid-scale agricultural producers ( who sow 75 per cent of the country 's cultivated area ) , possess a large volume of productive resources .  
In this context , the peace agreements set forth specific commitments whose purpose was ( a ) to establish the specific requirements for ending the armed conflict ; ( b ) to tackle some of the root causes of the conflict by starting from democratic principles ; and ( c ) to place special emphasis on the process of reconstruction as part of the economic and social development of the country .  
In other words , the prospects for lasting peace in El Salvador will call for sustained expansion of its economy based on a new model , expansion which is stimulated by a modern State apparatus guaranteeing fairness of distribution and presupposing all of the transformations wrought through the new democratic institutions .  
Technical and financial cooperation is still needed from the international community , however , failing which there is little likelihood of consolidation of economic growth , reconstruction , improved living conditions for the poorest sectors of the population , peace , democracy and the functioning of democratic institutions .  
In this context , it is worth mentioning that the changes taking place in Cuban society , principally in the economic sector , are creating a more conducive framework enabling the incipient movement of non-governmental organizations to reform Cuban civil society and to call for democratic rules in relations between society and the political authorities .  
Access for all to the values , knowledge and skills imparted by the educational system is a prerequisite for ensuring the continuity and stability of democratic institutions , guaranteeing political , economic , social and cultural participation , especially on the part of the most disadvantaged groups and contributing to the fight against poverty .  
In the strong belief that concrete , broad strategies must be developed and applied to fight corruption , we reiterate our commitment to adopt cooperation mechanisms to combat that criminal activity because it weakens the democratic system , undermines the prestige of its institutions and constitutes an agent of social disintegration and distortion of the economic system .  
Its closing consensus statement emphasized that media scrutiny of the exercise of political power was essential in a democratic society ; that all media laws should conform to international and constitutional standards ; and that journalists themselves have a duty to work to the highest professional standards .  
At a time when the transitional Government was endeavouring to improve the country 's listless and unstructured economy and to prepare for presidential and parliamentary elections , the international community should do all it could to mobilize support for a pluralistic and democratic Zaire .  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
According to Mr . Turneb Delp , spokesman for the Front national pour le changement et la d \ x { 5e66 } ocratie , the elections could not be free and democratic since the Provisional Electoral Council was composed mostly of members who were close supporters of President Aristide or of the parties making up the presidential coalition , and the elections were marred by massive fraud . 
Urges all the Afghan parties to work with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
Welcomes the satisfactory evolution of the political process in Haiti and the holding of legislative and municipal elections and the forthcoming presidential elections , in accordance with the Constitution , as indispensable elements in the strengthening of democratic institutions ;  
also the intensive efforts by the Government of Nicaragua to promote a sustained economic recovery and the considerable progress made in securing a broad social consensus by means of a process of national dialogue for the adoption of measures to lay the foundations for reconstruction and economic and social development , through a comprehensive transition process that will be further consolidated through the holding of free and democratic elections , which will take place at the end of 1996 ,

included harmony among the various national groups and political stability based on the equal rights of all citizens , the unity of its multinational people and the resolution of all State issues through peaceful , democratic means .  
the light of his findings , the Special Rapporteur puts forward a number of recommendations ranging from the consolidation of democratic institutions and the reform of the judicial system to the establishment of a national police force accepted by both communities and the deployment of human rights observers .  
One reform is the law on the integrated governmental administration and control system , whose main objectives are to develop and strengthen a State based on law and a democratic regime , to guarantee the efficiency and the effectiveness of the public sector , to eliminate the conditions of impunity that foster administrative corruption , and to integrate the external auditing system for the public sector with the internal control systems of its components .  
When we achieved our independence in 1957 , the fundamental challenge to leadership , including the nascent Malaysian civil service , was to serve a multiracial , multireligious , democratic , developing country whose economy was commodities-dependent and whose security was threatened by a communist insurgency . 
The purpose of the process is to create an administration that can carry forward the implementation of democratic social and economic reforms ; an administration capable of utilizing all past experiences and of consistently and dynamically creating conditions for the well-balanced development of the country ; and , finally , an administration that will ensure that the burden of reforms is evenly distributed , that will care about improving the living standards of Polish families , and that will work to ensure that citizens can live in peace , free from the fear of crime and economic abuse .  
In a democratic country , public administration which is effective and enlightened because it is refocused on its essential tasks can contribute powerfully to a country 's economic development not only by coordinating the efforts of public and private enterprise , but also by attracting worthwhile investment .  
We proceeded to achieve this with a special focus on India 's needs , and our Constitution set forth the institutional bases for resilient administrative processes , especially in the crucial areas of legal , judicial , parliamentary and democratic structures .  
Untiring efforts have also been made in the promotion of human rights , particularly in respect of information , democratic participation and the administrative and legal functions of democratic institutions guaranteeing the civil and political rights of the population , including documentation , the local administration of justice and civic education .  
At the same time , in operative paragraph 1 of the draft resolution , the General Assembly welcomes the recommendation contained in the Secretary-General 's report to renew the mandate of the joint participation of the United Nations with the Organization of American States in the International Civilian Mission to Haiti , with the task of verifying full observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms in order to establish a climate of freedom and tolerance propitious to the consolidation of democratic institutions .  
The consolidation of democratic Governments , growing respect for human rights and economic and social progress are a tangible reality in and a stimulus for the future of Latin America , a continent to which Spain is linked by solid historical ties of mutual friendship and confidence .  
The Government of Bolivia 's current efforts are essentially based on the consolidation of participatory democratic institutions and on the conviction that economic development must be compatible with care for nature and the environment in other words , that this must take place within the framework of sustainable development and of respect for ethnic and cultural diversity , in order to make unity in diversity possible .  
I know that all members have been following with interest , and are well informed about , the deep-seated qualitative changes in the political life of Benin and I wish to take advantage of this opportunity to thank everyone for the genuine interest with which they have followed our major political event : the recent presidential election in March 1996 , in which we could see a peaceful and orderly democratic transfer of power , without violence or bloodshed , which was totally in keeping with the rule of constitutional law in force since December 1990 .  
The generally correct and normal conduct of the ballot , the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of our political classes , the courageous and responsible attitude of the people of Benin and the unwavering stance taken continually by the Constitutional Court are all signs which demonstrate genuine political maturity and an irrevocable commitment to building a truly democratic society in the Republic of Benin .  
We urge the international community to remain committed to the cause of Bosnia and Herzegovina ; to remain vigilant as regards any ill intention against the independence and territorial integrity of that country ; to ensure the return of refugees and displaced persons to their homes ; to seek the arrest and extradition to The Hague of indicted war criminals ; to prevent any negative outside interference that could potentially impede the process of peaceful and democratic reintegration ; and to make available the assistance pledged for the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Bosnia .  
In this vision , the present weakness of our political systems can be regarded as a phase in the democratic transition to a modern developed Africa only if the international community fully realizes that democracy can not prosper in poor countries , where politics were for so long the road to social success , without exposing our citizens to the political games of those for whom the advent of democracy and its attendant competitive elections mean the end of the eminent position they enjoy in society thanks to the exercise of political power .  
Nevertheless , just as we understand that the world has changed , that there is a new international agenda governed by the common concerns of all peoples over environment preservation , population growth , respect for human rights , strengthening of democratic systems , recognition of women 's rights , and the social and economic development of nations , we also understand that this Organization must be renewed and readapted to the new world circumstances . 
The fundamental difficulties which faced our nation in its previous efforts at building a viable democracy are being progressively addressed , taking into account the objective realities of our national situation , so as to ensure an orderly transition and the establishment of durable democratic structures of governance at all levels in our country .  
Despite this difficult situation , Zaire has made it a point of honour to pursue its democratic process , committing itself to reestablishing the authority of the State , rebuilding the basic infrastructure , improving the country 's economic , financial and monetary situation , ensuring the security of persons and property and observing human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
It is a human , social , political and economic imperative for the international community and for all the actors and partners in development , in their own specific actions , to work responsibly for a more just and equitable framework for international trade , favouring a free and democratic economic partnership .  
The core objectives of the programme were , inter alia , to create and adjust the country 's macroeconomic policy , ensure a correct legal and regulatory framework for the development of a strong market economy , provide a transparent and accountable policy framework aimed at promoting investment , allocate adequate budgetary resources for social programmes , create the necessary conditions for the establishment and consolidation of democratic institutions and support good governance and political stability .  
The fashion for what is commonly called democracy is sweeping the surface of the earth , and one of the principal criteria which the developed countries democracy 's self-appointed guarantors use for deciding eligibility for development assistance is the establishment of a democratic system .  Should n't that respectable institution , democracy , be manifest within the Organization itself when it elects a competent and honest leader in whom to duly vest its authority ?  
It is already clear today that the conflict imposed on the Tajik people an enormous human tragedy was aimed at undermining the newly emerging foundations of the State and interfering with economic growth and market reforms and hence the country 's independent development along a general democratic course .  
The stabilization of Tajikistan 's economy is not only the key to satisfying the pressing social and economic needs of our people , but would without a doubt promote the process of national conciliation , social consolidation , and the strong and healthy formation of democratic institutions in the country as a whole .  
Firmly and consistently committed to the course of democratic development pursued by the President of the Republic of Tajikistan , Mr . Emomali Rakhmonov , the Government of my country promotes the involvement of the broad mass of the population in social , political and economic reform processes through such mechanisms as referendums , national elections to representative bodies , renovation of the judicial system and every possible encouragement of openness .  
The United Nations was born out of a yearning for a democratic multilateral system capable of addressing problems brought about by hideous tensions and conflicts throughout the world , with a view to making planet Earth a more secure , just and friendly place for present and future generations .  
Yet , strengthened by his popular legitimacy and the support of a broad majority of the people of the Comoros , in six months President Taki drafted the broad outlines of political , economic and social reforms to overcome the numerous obstacles impeding the construction of a democratic , prosperous and interdependent society in the Comoros .  
There is no doubt that the more representative the United Nations is , the more democratic it will be ; and that the more accountable the United Nations is , the more effective it will be , thus benefitting us all , small or large , weak or powerful , rich or poor .  
Moreover , my Government has pledged itself to respect the fundamental rights of all citizens as well as to other elements of civil society , such as a free press , freedom of expression , a fair and open democratic process , the supremacy under God of our Constitution and the effective functioning of the parliamentary system , for which our Constitution specifically and explicitly provides . 
It is rather incongruous that the same forces that are at the forefront of the effort to establish democratic institutions and representative governments in certain parts of the world are also engaged in an enterprise which , if successful , is calculated to destroy the free and democratic way of life in the eastern Caribbean .  
Society must be firmly rooted in the rule of law , democratic participation , gender equality , the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all , social justice , tolerance , respect for ethnic , religious and cultural diversity , and meeting the requirements of groups with specific needs , such as young and older people , as well as people with disabilities .  
We must foster and strengthen democratic participation in the political sphere to develop , through a sharing of responsibility between the State , local government and civil society , a model of unified efforts for social development .  
A world free of colonialism , foreign occupation and aggression , and protected from the threat of racial hegemony , expansionism or colonization is the necessary precursor of a world free of poverty , injustice and oppression , in which relations are more democratic , humane , secure and stable for the well-being of one and all .  
That positive development the end of the cold war also encouraged many in the developing world , especially those of us in Africa , to undertake far-reaching political and economic reform measures , with a view to laying the foundation for democratic transformation and meaningful economic growth and development .  
Success in reforms , promotion of the private sector and direct foreign investment , increased activity in the democratic process and the strengthening of civilian society are essential elements of an Agenda for Development , and to a large extent depend on the support of the international community , in terms of resources and political will .  
We have respectfully included the question of democracy in this debate because we do not think that any sustainable economic recovery is viable without a pluralistic and representative institutional framework or clear respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  The incremental measures contained in the Helms-Burton Act do not contribute to democratic transition in Cuba , nor do they make any real contribution to opening up the economy .  
Despite the importance of bilateral relations and successful regional organizations , the United Nations remains the principal mechanism capable of ensuring the transition from a bipolar and confrontational world to a multipolar and democratic one . 
Even though it is important to reaffirm a strong commitment of the private sector , donor Governments , agencies and non-governmental organizations to genuine partnership for the accelerated industrial growth of Africa , a critical step must be made to design policies based on the real needs of individual African economies , as development will take place in Africa only when its peoples have democratic control over their own policies .  
Among other things , a number of examples are given of the assistance provided by the United Nations system for political parties or movements , the mobilization of civil society , electoral assistance , communications media to enable them to act freely and independently , creating a political culture through observance and monitoring of human rights , improved accountability , support for transparency and quality of public sector management , democratic government structures , and strengthening the rule of law . 
The Assembly will agree with me that the generally proper and legitimate election , the peaceful behaviour of the vast majority of the national political class , the courageous and responsible attitude of the people of Benin and the unwavering rigour of the Constitutional Court are telling signs of genuine political maturity and an irreversible commitment to building a truly democratic society in the Republic of Benin .  
South Africa 's recent experience since its first truly democratic elections just over two years ago has indicated that the benefits of a vibrant democracy at both the national and the local levels with the full participation of all political parties , movements and civil society has again proven the value of the necessity for all Member States to strive for and promote a political culture of full participation and consultation in the affairs of state .  
Therefore , in this initial period of democratic reform , international support and assurances are of crucial importance in alleviating or offsetting the negative economic and social consequences which economic reform and structural adjustment programmes usually entail .  
The international community should therefore lend , as before , moral and methodological support , as well as economic , financial and other assistance which would allow the Governments of new or restored democracies to proceed with bold steps to create a thriving market economy and a democratic system and to alleviate the social costs sustained in the process .  
The incorporation of international human rights standards into national laws and policies and the building or strengthening of national institutions capable of protecting and promoting human rights and democracy under the rule of law are an inseparable , essential part of the democratic reform process and hence should be supported .  
Among the critical ones are ensuring the peaceful nature of political reforms ; establishing and consolidating domestic democratic institutions and standards ; restructuring ; and ensuring a social orientation that promotes economic transformation and is consolidated by a system of measures and safeguards to preserve social justice and protect society .  
New Zealand will make that commitment , because we are committed to building a strengthened and effective United Nations that is ready and able to tackle the challenges that lie ahead , and a United Nations system that is more internationally democratic and more representative of the world we live in as the century draws to a close .  
One can not but conclude that the progressive development and codification of international law would benefit from the recognition of the primacy of national laws in their interaction with applicable international law in the conduct of States ; in the preservation of the environment and ecological balance ; in respect for basic human rights and fundamental freedoms ; in the need to contain and eradicate the inordinate and indiscriminate bite of terrorism ; and in the espousal of the democratic ideal .  
Although 1996 began on a promising note with the peaceful and democratic general elections held in Palestine on 20 January , a series of devastating terrorist attacks against Israel in late February and early March quickly enveloped the spirit of optimism surrounding the peace process in a sombre and cynical cloud .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
It was also essential to create conditions for the reconstruction of civil society , particularly for the holding of free and fair elections and for building democratic institutions which would guarantee the rule of law and foster deep respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
With regard to Tibet , her delegation noted that it had formed an integral part of China since the thirteenth century and that the Tibetan people had assumed control of their country in 1959 , the year in which China had abolished serfdom and introduced democratic reforms in Tibet . In the past 30 years , the country 's economy had developed and the standard of living had risen .  
Aware of the importance of a human rights culture and of the need to strengthen the democratic process , her Government had implemented a series of legislative , administrative and educational measures recommended by the advisory committee on human rights , a national body established in 1990 , which was composed of representatives of the entire political , social and religious spectrum of Moroccan society .  
Recognizing also the intensive efforts by the Government of Nicaragua to promote a sustained economic recovery and the considerable progress made in securing a broad social consensus by means of a process of national dialogue for the adoption of measures to lay the foundations for reconstruction and economic and social development through a comprehensive transition process that will be further consolidated with the holding of free and democratic elections at the end of 1996 ,  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Supports the concern of the Central American countries to create a new model of regional security based on a reasonable balance of forces and the pre-eminence of civil authority , urges the Central American Security Commission to pursue negotiations for the preparation of the treaty on democratic security in Central America , which constitutes one of the basic aims of the Central American Integration System , and requests the Secretary-General to provide it with the requisite support in a timely manner ;  
To establish or strengthen operational coordination machinery for the competent institutions so as to increase the effectiveness of national and regional efforts to combat crime and all threats to democratic security necessitating the use of military , security or civilian police forces , such as terrorism , illicit arms trafficking , drug trafficking and organized crime ;  
The Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs shall be the organ responsible for coordinating the efforts of the region as a whole with the initiatives taken to counter threats to democratic security on the continent and in other parts of the world , and , in this sense , shall be the organ responsible for preparing positions and concluding cooperation accords or agreements with institutions and bodies responsible for the maintenance of international peace and security , independently of the previously established international commitments of each State Party . Article 64 .  
Progress in the political transition , for instance , the consolidation of new democratic institutions , the convergence of opinions in favour of the primacy of civilian authority , the normal conduct of elections , the emergence of new forms of representation of civil society and the national consensus surrounding the broadening of the political sectors incorporated in the Congress of the Republic .  
We are convinced that only a substantial improvement in the social and economic situation in a situation of national reconciliation can create the right conditions for a democratic , stable and secure Haiti to develop .  
It will be difficult for those who must daily face a lack of the basic necessities of life to commit themselves to a democratic system unless it brings about a genuine improvement in their low standard of living .  
The Centre is developing a technical assistance and advisory programme aimed at assisting China in building the necessary administrative and legal structures in the area of criminal law and criminal justice in accordance with democratic principles and respect for human rights .  
Urges all the Afghan parties to work with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the cessation of armed confrontation and the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the people of Afghanistan ;  
Noting that , in spite of national efforts and the support given by the international community to the implementation of the priority programmes in fulfilment of the Peace Agreement , including the strengthening of democratic institutions , the national reconstruction plan and the economic and social development plan , the implementation of certain programmes and projects basic to the process has continued to be affected by , inter alia , the limited availability and the reduction of financial resources in support of the consolidation of peace ,  
The topics covered at previous sessions of the Committee , such as labour relations , recruitment career and training policies , social security , the effects of structural and technological change , formed part of the ILO record in defending democratic values in the public service .

During the special plenary session of the Congress devoted to technical cooperation , it was stated that technical cooperation was indispensable to building and supporting both democratic institutions and effective criminal justice systems .  
Cooperation with the Division was included in the programme of action of the Organization for the years 1996 to 2000 with the objective , on a global level , of furthering democratic governance and sustainable development under the rule of law through the promotion of an independent , accessible and efficient judiciary .  
Throughout the long , grave political crisis , that brought my country to the brink of collapse , Haiti has committed itself to national reconstruction with a view to creating a State based on law and a democratic regime able to guarantee all of its citizens economic and social well-being .  
The two strategies followed by Mexico in this field were as follows : ( a ) establishing channels for communication of intelligence and information that would make it possible to expand the knowledge base in each country and to enhance the process of communication with countries that possessed more advanced techniques ; and ( b ) international cooperation in combating criminal activities that frustrated the efforts of Governments to fulfil their commitment to promote human rights , fundamental freedoms and democratic decision-making .  
In addition , its stable currency and Government , advanced financial system , free movement of funds and democratic safeguards against police powers together make Canada inviting to persons engaging in international money-laundering .  
Therefore , the primary [ ultimate ] loyalty of public officials shall be to the public interests of their country as expressed through the [ democratic ] institutions of government , and not to [ national or foreign ] persons , political parties [ or entities ] [ or specific government departments or agencies ] .  
Urge all those involved in the implementation process to undertake urgent and effective measures to stop the tendency of ethnic partition of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina and draw the attention of the international community to the serious threat to the stability of the entire Balkan region as a result of the prevailing tendency to support ethnic instead of democratic forces ;  
As described in greater detail in the report of the Secretary-General on technical advisory services for the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme ( E / CN . 15 / 1996 / 8 ) , such resources could be used for technical cooperation activities and advisory services geared towards building and supporting democratic institutions and effective criminal justice systems with emphasis on the complementary relationship of justice , peace and development and the need to address them simultaneously .  
Proper management of the urban process entails strengthening democratic local government at all levels to mobilize the societal resources required to expand and modernize inadequate urban infrastructures and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of housing management to prevent the current shortage from becoming even more acute .  
We are referring to the desire of the peoples and States of the Commonwealth to make more effective use of their material and intellectual potential with a view to stimulating their economies , raising their standard of living and ensuring sustainable democratic development .  
The establishment of an appropriate defence system incorporated in collective security arrangements ( NATO ) and the definite formulation of a defence policy based on the principles of civil control of military forces and on a democratic political system are our permanent commitment .  
That the rule of law was restored in that country with the return to constitutional order on October 15 , 1994 , the reinstatement of the officials legitimately elected by the Haitian people in December 1990 , and the successful holding of free and democratic local , parliamentary , and presidential elections in 1995 , leading to a peaceful and democratic transfer of power ;  
The agreement represents a model for national reconciliation ; it offers the prospect of building a pluralistic democratic society with high standards in the sphere of the human rights and equal participation of all political and regional forces in the public life of the country .  
The cooperative movement believes that democratic procedures applied to economic activities are feasible , desirable and efficient , and that democratically elected economic organizations make a contribution to the common good .  
While ECOWAS Foreign Ministers have identified the requisite conditions to ensure free and fair elections , we attach great importance to the full independence of the electoral Commission and to disarmament substantial enough so that the free participation of the Liberian people in the democratic process will not be constrained .  
The eradication of poverty can not be accomplished through anti-poverty programmes alone but will require democratic participation , and changes in economic structures in order to ensure access for all to resources , opportunities and public services , to undertake policies geared to more equitable distribution of wealth and income , to implement social protection for those who can not support themselves , and to assist people confronted with unforeseen catastrophe , whether individual or collective , natural , social or technological .  
Under either the criteria established by the Dayton Peace Agreement or the minimum standards relied upon by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) for certification , the pending elections and their results within the Republika Srpska can not be considered democratic , free or fair , or legally valid .  
The situation of refugees , returnees and displaced persons in Africa has continued to be influenced by the harsh socio-economic realities of the continent and the related problems of the evolution of viable political institutions and processes based on democratic principles that will accommodate the diversity of cultures and the aspiration for peace , security and sustainable development .  
Danish development policy is an integral part of Danish foreign policy , in which the main objectives are , inter alia : promotion of common security , promotion of democratic government and human rights , creation of economic and social development and ensuring ecologically sustainable development .  
As indicated in Declaration No . 1 / 488 , SLORC set itself four objectives : first , the re-establishment of peace and tranquillity in the country ; second , the restoration and provision of communication and transport ; third , measures to ensure better supply of food , clothing and shelter by facilitating the operations of private enterprise and the cooperatives in these sectors ; and fourth , when the first three measures would have been accomplished , the holding of multi-party democratic elections to be held in a free and fair manner .  
In this regard , the Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating at the end of September 1996 in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the Secretary General of NLD in her compound .  
The role of the universities , equipped with scientific councils representing the teaching and research institutions and research personnel and elected under a democratic system independent of the Administration , has shown considerable improvement over the earlier situation ( regulated by Act No . 86-80 of 9 August 1986 ) .  
In the past few years , the United Nations has continuously made considerable efforts to foster a peaceful settlement in Angola through sustained action aimed at establishing a lasting peace , ensuring a return to stability and preserving the unity of the country , and at the same time meeting the conditions for national reconciliation in strict observance of commitments entered into and democratic principles . 
Despite being forced to devote a large part of its human and material resources to defending its land and people against the expansionist policies of Israel , the Syrian Arab Republic had undertaken a comprehensive and successful social development programme .  The leadership provided by the President had ensured the political stability and democratic climate necessary for broad participation in youth-related activities .  
Since then , agreements have been concluded on human rights ; the resettlement of persons displaced by the armed conflict ; the establishment of the historical clarification commission ; the identity and rights of indigenous peoples ; social and economic aspects and the agrarian situation ; and now , the strengthening of civilian power and the role of the armed forces in a democratic society .  
It is vitally important to strengthen civilian power as the expression of the will of the people through the exercise of political rights , reinforce the legislative branch , reform the administration of justice and guarantee public security , all of which are crucial for the enjoyment of civil liberties and rights ; and , within a democratic institutional framework , it is incumbent upon the Guatemalan armed forces to discharge the essential task of protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity ,  
Together with the agreements already signed , this Agreement seeks to create the conditions for genuine reconciliation among the people of Guatemala , based upon respect for human rights and the diversity of its peoples and on their shared determination to overcome the lack of social , economic and political opportunities , which undermines democratic coexistence and restricts the development of the nation ,  
All the Guatemala peace agreements posit that a firm and lasting peace must be based on respect for human rights and for the multi-ethnic , multicultural and multilingual character of the Guatemalan nation ; national economic development with social justice ; social participation ; the conciliation of interests ; and democratic institution-building .  
The necessary amendments shall continue to be made to the corresponding regulations so that the military education system is consistent , in its philosophical framework , with respect for the Guatemalan Constitution and other laws , with a culture of peace and democratic coexistence , with the doctrine defined in this Agreement , and with national values , the integral development of the individual , knowledge of our national history , respect for human rights and the identity and rights of the indigenous peoples , and the primacy of the individual .  
Recognizing also the intensive efforts by the Government of Nicaragua to promote a sustained economic recovery and the considerable progress made in securing a broad social consensus by means of a process of national dialogue for the adoption of measures to lay the foundations for reconstruction and economic and social development through a comprehensive transition process that will be further consolidated with the holding of free and democratic elections in October 1996 ,  
As a regional political organization of which Tajikistan is a member and which had established a rapport with the Government before becoming involved with humanitarian work , OSCE is in a position not only to monitor human rights but to support the development of the entire democratic process , combining an active field presence with political influence .  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Assistance in the legislative process , especially with regard to the following areas : ( i ) right of everyone to take part in the government of his or her country ; ( ii ) equal access to public service ; ( iii ) criteria of democratic elections ( e.g . universal and equal suffrage ; the secrecy of the ballot ; respect for freedom of opinion , expression , information , assembly and association ) ; ( iv ) independent review of alleged irregularities ; and ( v ) objective and independent electoral administration ;  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
In other words , accepting this as the sole parameter would be tantamount to recognizing the domination of the Security Council by a small group of rich and mighty countries and would be contrary to the profound aspiration of the international community to establishing a system of collective security in which a reformed , modernized and more democratic Security Council would fully take into account , with efficiency and transparency , the preoccupations and needs of all States , regardless of their size , level of development or economic conditions .  
Our ultimate objective in pursuing these reforms is to bring about a democratic , representative , dynamic and revitalized Security Council which will be more relevant to the common problems we all face .  
In so saying , we acknowledge that many African countries have taken very considerable steps to improve their level of social and economic development , including undertaking structural economic reform to correct economic imbalances , increasing the priority given to social expenditures , providing social safety nets , improving the rights of women and children , protecting the environment , enhancing agricultural production and marketing processes , increasing food security and embracing democratic processes , as well as the introduction of good governance .

Recognizing also the intensive efforts by the Government of Nicaragua to promote a sustained economic recovery and the considerable progress made in securing a broad social consensus by means of a process of national dialogue for the adoption of measures to lay the foundations for reconstruction and economic and social development through a comprehensive transition process that will be further consolidated with the holding of free and democratic elections in October 1996 ,  
The Covenant , which was considered by many to be the single most important human rights instrument , codified the essential freedoms which people must enjoy in an effective democratic society , such as the right to vote and to participate in government , to freedom of peaceful assembly , to equal protection of the law , the right to liberty and security and to freedom of opinion and expression .  
Fully aware that States , the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority to dealing with this scourge , which undermines development , economic and political stability and democratic institutions , and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives ,  
Despite considerable economic difficulties , her Government was determined to preserve those achievements and to bring about economic , social and political renewal based on a market economy , social justice , the rejection of any form of marginalization or exclusion , and the establishment of a durable democratic system .  
The right to development was thus essential to the peoples of developing countries , who needed higher incomes , improved social , health and education services and a chance to escape from extreme poverty and enjoy better living conditions if they were to be able to make a constructive contribution to the development of democratic systems that would guarantee full respect for their human rights .

As I pointed out in my previous report , it is in these areas that MICIVIH has placed emphasis since its redeployment in October 1994 and it is in these areas that the Mission , because of its extensive field experience and accumulated expertise , would be able to make a significant contribution to the consolidation of key structures charged with protection of human rights and to the deepening of the democratic process . 
Urges all the Afghan parties to work closely with the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan with a view to achieving a comprehensive political solution leading to the eventual establishment of a democratic Government elected through free and fair elections based on the right to self-determination of the peoples of Afghanistan ;

The extension of the UNSMIH mandate is necessary to complete the professionalization of the Haitian police and to continue motivating its performance in Port-au-Prince and the rest of the country , and thus to be able to create the secure and stable environment needed by the people and Government of Haiti in order to promote national reconciliation , strengthen the administration of justice , consolidate the democratic system and stimulate the country 's economic and social development .  
Europe possesses what is essential for achieving this - a space with a single world-view extending from Vancouver to Vladivostok , where the bipolar world no longer exists and a common value system based on the philosophy of democratic liberalism and respect for human rights is being established . 
In recognition of the interdependence and mutually reinforcing nature of democracy , development and human rights , human rights education under the Decade shall seek to further effective democratic participation in the political , economic , social and cultural spheres , and shall be utilized as a means of promoting economic and social progress and people-centred sustainable development .  
Our common goal is to ensure that , while keeping and promoting this positive trend , we are vigilant and active in order to contribute together to the maintenance of peace , the establishment and consolidation of democratic societies based on the rule of law and respect for human and minority rights , social development and the promotion of international cooperation .

The Government of Guatemala reiterates that the incorporation of URNG in the political and legal life of the country , under conditions of security and dignity , is in the national interest , given that it is directly related to the objective of reconciliation and the consolidation of a democratic system open to all , and to the contribution of all Guatemalans in building a prosperous country , a just and equitable socio-economic system and a multicultural , multiethnic and multilingual nation ,  
Because democratic Governments are freely chosen by their citizens and held accountable through periodic and genuine elections and other mechanisms , they are more likely to promote and respect the rule of law , respect individual and minority rights , cope effectively with social conflict , absorb migrant populations and respond to the needs of marginalized groups .  
Such a culture is built upon a societal consensus not about policy , but about the process and framework of democratic political life : that the will of the people is the basis of governmental authority ; that all individuals have a right to take part in government ; that there shall be periodic and genuine elections ; that power changes hands through popular suffrage rather than intimidation or force ; that political opponents and minorities have a right to express their views ; and that there can be loyal and legal opposition to the Government in power . 
This will not only require a society of States committed to democratic principles and processes ; it will also demand an enlarged international civil society deeply involved in democratic institutions , whether State , inter-State or supra-State , private or quasi-private ; committed to democratic practices , procedures and political pluralism ; and composed of peoples ingrained with those habits of openness , fairness and tolerance that have been associated with democracy since ancient times . 
As States have confronted popular demands to deal with economic , security and environmental issues that evade effective action on a strictly national basis , they have increasingly found themselves seeking solutions through cooperative arrangements and participation in regional and international intergovernmental organizations .  Such organizations are proliferating and the scope of their activities is broadening , thereby fostering democratic principles and participation at the international level .  
Through the series of global conferences on interlocking economic and social issues , the United Nations has been providing an ongoing democratic process through which a new international consensus on and framework for development can be built .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .

Emphasizing the importance of the democratic , efficient , transparent and representative governing structures of the United Nations Environment Programme , with a complementary , specific and distinct role and mandate for each of their components ,  
The brilliant and forward-looking authors of the Charter of the United Nations and the rest of us who are the beneficiaries of their collective wisdom and imagination have reason to hope for a firm consolidation of a democratic , stable and compassionate world order that would make a clear break with the past , characterized by two unprecedented and most destructive wars in this century .  
The Bucharest document identified an almost universal recognition that a democratic system of government is the best model to ensure a framework of liberties for lasting solutions to political , economic and social problems .

Following the peaceful changes that took place in Benin after the National Conference of Active Forces of the Nation in February 1990 , the people of Benin have been experiencing an era of democratic renewal based , inter alia , on the building of the rule of law , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms , the eradication of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development through its three component factors economic , social and environmental .  
Efforts to experiment with introducing new forms of democratic process to provide people with a choice of their elected representatives at the municipal or local level in certain countries deserve our notice and appreciation , if we are sincere about recognizing different historical traditions in the evolution of democratic political practice .  
The time has come for us all to display the necessary political will and determination in order to reach agreement on a comprehensive set of measures which will lead to the creation of a Security Council which is transparent , democratic , accountable and thus credible and legitimate .  
It is beyond all doubt that a consistent implementation of all articles of the Dayton Agreement is crucial to the prospects for a normally functioning , democratic State capable of ensuring the basic social , legal , security and other conditions for everybody .  
The Eighth Islamic Summit Conference , held in Tehran last week , inter alia , reaffirmed the commitment of the member States of the Organization of the Islamic Conference to preserve the legal continuity , unity , territorial integrity and sovereignty of the State of Bosnia and Herzegovina within its internationally recognized borders and fully supported the establishment of a sovereign , democratic , multi-ethnic and multicultural State of Bosnia and Herzegovina .  
It is now three years and two months since the restoration of constitutional order enabled the Haitian people bravely to take up again the task of creating a State based on the rule of law and a democratic regime capable of ensuring increasing respect for the political , economic and social rights of all citizens .  
Mr . Thiebaud ( France ) ( interpretation from French ) : The General Assembly is being asked today to extend the mandate of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti ( MICIVIH ) to 31 December 1998 , in response to the wishes expressed by President Ren Pr � al in his letter dated 10 November 1997 to the Secretary-General , in which he requested the continued support of that Mission to carry out the institutional consolidation that is essential for a state of law and for the deepening of the democratic process in Haiti .  
The elimination of our armed forces and the demilitarization of our society have fostered a broad , pluralistic , representative system in the form of a democratic and social state of law , which is the legal structure representing the will for peace , conciliation and harmonious coexistence Costa Ricans have chosen .  
The important document adopted by this Commission at its substantive session last year with respect to arms transfers , with particular stress on illicit traffic , was a positive step with which the international community has moved to eradicate a tangible threat to the stability of legitimately constituted Governments and firmly to confront the drug traffickers and terrorists working in this illegal market to undermine democratic societies .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism , international crime and illicit arms transfers , as well as illicit drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
The Commission noted with interest that the democratic transition process in Equatorial Guinea had led to the holding of the first multi _ party legislative elections in 1993 , the first multi _ party municipal elections in 1995 and the first multi _ candidate presidential election in February 1996 ( para . 3 ) , although it expressed its deep concern at the fact that the presidential election had not guaranteed transparency and had not allowed the proper participation of all the political forces ( para .  4 ) .  
The Commission 's operations also constituted a very democratic process in which no veto power was considered , all claimant countries were treated equally and , for the first time in history , an absolute priority was given to individual claimants , particularly the most deprived and needy , which added a significant humanitarian dimension to the Commission 's work . 
In a democratic society , the typical functions of the armed forces relate to the defence of sovereignty and territorial integrity ; any other function is atypical and exceptional ; like any other government institution , their exercise of other functions must take place in a context of subordination to lawfully constituted authority and be preceded by a decision of and be monitored by the lawfully constituted authorities of the State within their specific sphere of competence . 
Whereas the internal armed conflict that Guatemala has experienced for over three decades resulted from the closing of political opportunities for democratic expression and participation and from the adoption of measures of political repression against individuals and organizations linked or identified with the Government overthrown in 1954 ,  
Whereas , given a situation where there is social and economic injustice , including discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples , and the systematic denial of individual and collective rights and safeguards , the peoples concerned have the right to seek the necessary democratic change ,  
Whereas building a democratic , multi-ethnic , multicultural and multilingual nation , with social justice , calls for equitable participation by all citizens , both men and women , on the basis of complete political and ideological pluralism ,  
Despite concerns that Internet access may be creating a new social strata of haves and have-nots , electronic communications have the potential to increase the exchange of knowledge rapidly around the world in an open , easy and relatively democratic manner , which is not only useful for linking scientists and scientific centres with each other but also for opening up available information to ordinary citizens instantly on demand , reducing their intellectual distance from scientific information .  
India 's political commitment to unity in diversity , by which it seeks to make viable a democracy covering a subcontinent and embracing a society which is multireligious and multilingual ( and therefore differentiated , diversified and complex ) is certainly an example which the country is offering to humankind and which reflects a mode of democratic organization of society based on respect for and viability of diversity , particularly in the field of religion .

Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
Calls upon the Government of Guatemala , URNG and Guatemalan society as a whole to make every possible effort to familiarize the Guatemalan people with the content of the Peace agreements as quickly as possible , to ensure the full participation of the people in building the new multi _ ethnic , multicultural and plurilingual nation , establishing a democratic society with social justice , initiating a period of sustained and sustainable economic and social development and ensuring the pre _ eminence of civilian authority in national decision _ making ;  
Requests the administering Powers to transmit to the Secretary-General information called for under Article 73 e of the Charter and other updated information and reports , including reports on the wishes and aspirations of the peoples of the Territories regarding their future political status as expressed in fair and free referendums and other forms of popular consultation , as well as the results of any informed and democratic processes consistent with practice under the Charter which indicate the clear and freely expressed wish of the people to change the existing status of the Territories ;  
Against this background it is easy to understand the huge significance of the study completed by Mrs . Nicole Questiaux in 1982 , [ 1 ] which determined the conditions and requirements on which the legality of a state of emergency depended and which ensured that proper application thereof is compatible with respect for human rights and with democratic forms of government .  
In short , according to the criteria laid down by the Inter _ American Court , the sole valid justification for states of emergency is the defence of the democratic system , which is understood as a system that affords absolute protection to the constant maintenance of certain essential rights of the human person .  
The most valuable lesson that can be drawn from the practice of the international monitoring bodies and from the Special Rapporteur 's own experience is the certainty that , to the extent that the norms and principles governing the state of emergency are respected , its impact on the functioning of the institutions , the validity of the rule of law and the enjoyment of human rights will necessarily be limited and compatible with a democratic system of government .  
The professionalism of the role the army now plays in national life was made clear by its comportment during the electoral process of March 1997 : in marked contrast to the record of military interference in the history of El Salvador , the army demonstrated its respect for the democratic decision of the Salvadorian people that those elections represented .  8 .  Before the signing of the peace agreements , public security functions were carried out by bodies dependent on the armed forces .  
However , although the National Civil Police is a professional public security body with the potential to execute modern and democratic public security policies , the model established by the peace accords has not been consolidated without the occurrence of distortions .  
UNDP , working in close collaboration with ONUSAL , MINUSAL and ONUV and in consultation with the beneficiary organizations , formulated and implemented priority technical assistance programmes in the areas of : administration of justice , public security , reintegration of former combatants and demobilized soldiers , the Fund for the Protection of the Wounded and War-Disabled , the protection of human rights through institutional support of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights , and democratic participation .  
If , as a last resort , States consider themselves compelled to undertake proceedings of expropriation or compulsory acquisition , such action shall be : ( a ) determined and envisaged by law and norms regarding forced eviction , insofar as these are consistent with internationally recognized human rights ; ( b ) solely for the purpose of protecting the general welfare in a democratic society ; ( c ) reasonable and proportional ; and ( d ) in accordance with the present Guidelines .  
With regard to Haiti , the establishment and training of a professional civilian police force will be a fundamental factor in maintaining peace and security and in ensuring the real and effective functioning of democratic institutions , the rule of law and full respect for human rights .  
The international community must continue to provide technical , economic and financial assistance to support political stability , balanced development , the establishment of democratic institutions and respect for human rights .  
It also requires a fair legal system , efficient democratic institutions , popular participation and the promotion of sustainable economic development as preconditions for social stability .  
The individual elements of a culture of peace are therefore : non-violence and respect for human rights , respect and solidarity among all peoples and dialogue between cultures , the linkage of peace to democratic participation and sustainable human development , the free flow and sharing of information and knowledge , contribution to conflict-prevention and post-conflict peace-building , and equality between women and men , all best supported through projects in which people take an active role in transforming their values , attitudes and behaviours .  
Even in situations where it may be necessary to impose limitations on such a right , full compliance with article 4 of the Covenant is required so that any limitations imposed must be determined by law only insofar as this may be compatible with the nature of these [ i.e . economic , social and cultural ] rights and solely for the purpose of promoting the general welfare in a democratic society .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .

With a view to promoting peace and strengthening security in the Mediterranean region , the new Government of Malta has time and time again committed itself to a foreign policy that is based on the values of democratic governance , on the upholding of fundamental human rights , on the peaceful settlement of disputes and on a policy that is in favour of disarmament and strongly opposes military aggression , and the manufacture , distribution and proliferation of all types of armaments and weapons , especially weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological .  
Pursuant to the peace agreements , priorities have been set and various projects formulated with the aim of : ( a ) achieving the economic and social reintegration of former combatants and demobilized members of the armed forces ; ( b ) attending to the economic and social needs of the communities most affected by the conflict and improving the living conditions of the poorest groups ; ( c ) consolidating democratic institutions ; and ( d ) promoting legal and constitutional reform .  
However , on a number of occasions the response fell short of the amount required to complete other programmes .  The main projects that still require funding include those on democratic institutions and productive and social reintegration .  
Respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms , democratic and effective institutions , combating corruption , transparent , representative and accountable governance , popular participation , an independent judiciary , the rule of law and civil peace are among the indispensable foundations for development .  
As underlined in the Programme of Action , international economic imbalances , poverty and environmental degradation , combined with the absence of peace and security , violations of human rights and the varying degrees of development of judicial and democratic institutions are all factors in the movement of people .  
Those countries should implement at the national level structural adjustment policies that take into account social development goals , as well as effective development strategies that create a more favourable climate for trade and investment , give priority to human resources development and further promote the development of democratic institutions .  
The Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the General Secretary of NLD in her compound .  
Genuine and substantive discussions should take place without further delay between the present military regime and the leaders of NLD and with other political leaders who were duly elected in the democratic elections of 1990 , including representatives of ethnic minorities .  Certain steps reportedly taken in July by SLORC , apparently to initiate such discussions , are a welcome and positive development , but that development must be intensified .  
The Security Council reiterates the importance of a political settlement and national reconciliation and calls upon the parties to cooperate with the International Mediation Committee chaired by the President of Gabon and with the Joint United Nations / Organization of African Unity Special Envoy in reaching rapid agreement on peaceful transitional arrangements leading to the holding of democratic and free and fair elections with the participation of all parties .  
If , by a democratic regime , we mean one in which human rights are respected , power is vested in the Government by the people through free elections , there is a separation of powers , the law is enforced by the authorities , there is equality under the law , the armed forces and police are at the service of everyone , the courts perform their functions independently , political parties express themselves freely , and there is freedom of the press , then this report shows that none of these conditions are being met .  
The new State structure , based on an omnipresent state party ( although this is denied ) , the absence of a short - , medium - or long-term democratic project , and the fact that there is nobody capable of controlling the exercise of power all lead the Special Rapporteur to conclude that the Congolese people do not enjoy , and will not enjoy in the foreseeable future , the human right to democracy .  
We must pay special , sustained attention to the proliferation of light weapons and small arms , which not only threaten the security and stability of African States , but are major obstacles to the building and consolidation of the democratic process , without which no economic and social development is conceivable on our continent .

At a time when the precarious nature of the political , social and economic climate is exerting increasing pressure on the foundations of the key institutions on which respect for the rule of law depend , it is more necessary than ever that the international community continue and step up its assistance , and contribute , by its presence , to consolidating democratic institutions in Haiti .

In the current post-transition phase , the results achieved in the democratic processes and economic reform , which have been recognized by the international community and financial institutions , qualify Romania legitimately to play a clearer and more active role in defining and designing common projects of security and progress in the region and in the world , including within the United Nations and its specialized agencies .

Albania has a peculiar history of chronic isolation , of almost total estrangement from the rest of the world , of great potential , human and natural wealth , while being , at the same time , underdeveloped and poor .  Our difficulties of growth are directly linked to the legacies of former rules and half a century of communism , of non-existent , non-functioning or malfunctioning democratic institutions , both during and after the collapse of communism and its structures , as well as with our mentality .  
We appeal to this global Organization , to European organizations and structures , to those who made a major contribution to ending the war in Bosnia through the Dayton accords and to all those who have the power and the political will to continue to exert the necessary pressure to direct this major pending issue in the Balkans onto the path of negotiation , with proper international mediation , with a view to a just , peaceful and democratic solution acceptable to all .

In the debate at this session on proposals for reforming the United Nations , I would like , at the outset , to state that the strategic objective of all of the reforms envisaged must be to provide better conditions for the proper functioning of the Organization so that it can fulfil its founders ' dream of a lasting , democratic , responsible and credible Organization .  
But to achieve the more democratic , efficient and dynamic United Nations we are dreaming of , it is essential that the reforms reach the heart of one of its principal organs : the Security Council must stop being a bunker impenetrable to the General Assembly 's demands for an equitable and fair expansion .  
Here , and with specific reference to reform of the Security Council , Benin strongly recommends that the following principles should be taken into account : an increase in the membership of the Security Council truly reflecting the political and economic configuration of today 's world ; equitable geographical representation of the five regional groups , with the African group entitled to four seats , two permanent and two non-permanent ; and protection of democratic and transparent functioning , ultimately involving the elimination of the right of veto .  
However , we know that we can rely on international cooperation , founded not only on solidarity , but on mutual interest and partnership , to overcome the difficulties confronting us , to support our efforts at economic and social recovery , to build a State genuinely based on the rule of law and to construct a free , democratic , modern and prosperous nation .  
Each must agree to subordinate its individual decision and discretion to a global political will , manifested through truly democratic and representative organs of the United Nations , reflecting the authentic judgement of the world community of States .  
These elections will have positive effects at all levels national , regional , Arab and international for they represent a new and advanced turning point in strengthening the democratic direction that is based on a multi-party political system , freedom of the press , respect for human rights , and the institutional consolidation of the modern Yemeni State . 
It is indeed ironic to note in this Assembly the contradictory positions of some of our members , who purport to be champions and defenders of human rights issues and yet continue to maintain colonial situations that directly deny genuine democratic representation and the rights of people to govern themselves in a manner consistent with their political aspirations . 
At the eleventh summit of Heads of State and Government of the Rio Group , held in Asunci \ x { 93ee } , Paraguay , in August this year , our leaders agreed that the elimination of extreme poverty , the achievement of social justice , the promotion of forms of citizen participation , as well as the improvement of standards of living and the general welfare of our peoples are permanent objectives for our countries and can be more easily achieved through cooperation and coordination between democratic Governments .  
Algeria is keen to preserve what it has achieved , in spite of economic difficulties due to financial constraints and the requirements of economic and institutional restructuring , which are designed firmly to put Algerian society on the path to progress and modernity through the creation of a more efficient market economy and the establishment of a pluralistic democratic society .  
Our strategy for achieving these goals is based on a people-centred approach that attempts to strengthen participation at the grass roots level by providing for decentralized , participatory , village-level democratic institutions with statutory representation for women and socially disadvantaged groups of people .  It is our resolve to place the concerns of gender , the rights and interests of the child , and the potential of the girl child and of youth , at the centre of all our decision-making .

The civil society , including those involved in its political , economic , social and cultural life , needs to be fully engaged to promote democratic principles and harmony between the society , the individual and the environment as a basis for a culture of peace .  
It needs to be questioned to what extent this secrecy is compatible with the access to information necessary for democratic practice and social justice and whether , in some cases , instead of contributing to long-term security , it may conceal information about processes ( ecological , financial , military , etc . ) which are a potential threat to everyone and which need therefore to be addressed collectively . 
The treatment of the interrelated subjects of trade , finance , technology and investment , and the coordination of macroeconomic policies and their social impact in the international context , should be substantive issues in the political debate conducted in the Committee , since the General Assembly was not only the supreme political body at the intergovernmental level but , above all , the most democratic body in existence .

Proceeding from these ideas , it is assumed that a democratic society requires the existence and free exercise of certain basic individual and group rights and freedoms , which the Universal Declaration and the International Covenants - not to mention at this juncture other international , regional and national human rights instruments , norms and standards - define and thereby indicate their limits .  
A democratic society , moreover , whatever may be the cultural , political , social and economic framework in which it is achieved , is identified by certain principles and institutions , such as pluralism , the rule of law , legitimacy , political equality , popular control and public accountability of government , which , again , have their starting point in human rights and freedoms .
