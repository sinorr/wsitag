After its final review , the Superior People 's Court of Guangdong Province ruled to reject the appeal and uphold the original sentence .  In accordance with the law , the Supreme People 's Court verified and approved the death sentence of the criminal Wang Haibin and the permanent deprivation of his political rights , ordering Shenzhen Municipal Intermediate People 's Court to carry out the execution .  
It has been learned that , last year , Sichuan 's procuratorial organs focused on investigating economic criminal cases involving leading cadres at and above the county and departmental levels ' state-owned enterprises , and 122 leading cadres were found to have been involved in major cases , of which 97 were at the departmental or bureau level .  
A group of leading cadres in Liaoning Province who violated policies by occupying too many houses , illegally taking funds for housing purchases , illegally turning public houses into private ones , and using public funds to renovate houses beyond the standard were investigated and handled sternly .  Party and government disciplinary measures were taken against 62 cadres at or above the county department level in the province , and eight people were transferred to judicial organs to be investigated and affixed criminal responsibilities .  
Over the last year , the form and scope of making procuratorial work open have continued to broaden - - we have established a procuratorial work report system and a rights and obligations briefing system ; we have experimented on a system to open examination of civil and administrative counterappeal cases , nonprosecution cases , and criminal petition cases ; and procuratorial work has been made more transparent , which has been well received by the public .  
The fundamental reason why he degenerated from a senior cadre into a corrupt element and a criminal against the people is that he abandoned the program of serving the people and the ideals and beliefs of a communist , harbored different ambitions from the party , and was greedy for power , money , and sex , and his selfish desires swelled up to a tremendous degree .  
The aforementioned matters are major matters that concern the state 's basic political system , economic system , and civil , criminal , and other legal systems .  
Last year , it resolutely punished criminal elements who attempted to subvert state power and split the country .  In the struggle against the cult organization " Falungong , " the judicial contingent strictly applied the Criminal Law and relevant judicial explanations and sternly cracked down on criminal activities of organizing and using cult organizations to undermine enforcement of laws , cause deaths , and obtain state secrets illegally .  
In addition , the judicial contingent also tried a number of criminal cases of major impact , sternly punished criminal activities that harmed the order of the market economy , thereby protecting legal rights and interests of various economic sectors in the midst of reform and opening up , and ensuring healthy development of our country 's economy .  
2 .  Article Three of General Work Principles shall be amended as " The national committee and local committees of CPPCC shall implement the strategy of running the country in accordance with the law ; publicize and enforce ( carry out ) the constitution , laws , and various principles and policies of the state ; and mobilize social forces to actively take part in the cause of building material civilization and socialist spiritual civilization ( assist the state organs in cracking down on criminal activities aimed at sabotaging socialism in economic field and other fields ) . "  
it is necessary to do a good job of effectively carrying out nationality , religious , national defense , diplomatic , and Taiwan affairs work , to resolutely fight sabotage activities carried out by hostile forces at home and abroad , and to combat various law-violating and criminal activities , so as to maintain social and political stability , the unity of the motherland , and national security and to create a good international and domestic environment for reform and development .  
criminal activities are on the rise in financial computer systems and e-commerce systems ; the CIH virus , BO hacker procedures , and other harmful databases have been spread far and wide .  Some hackers at home and abroad illegally intruded into information systems in important areas of China , attacking websites and stealing state or commercial secrets .  
They should rectify and improve public order inside and around schools and sternly crack down on various illegal and criminal activities that jeopardize the normal order in school and should strengthen community development and actively create a harmonious environment in families and neighborhoods to conscientiously guarantee the youngsters ' healthy growth .  
He said : Now we already have copyright laws and pertinent criminal laws throughout the country .  In 1998 we further published laws and regulations against the smuggling of pirated goods .  We will also use for reference relevant foreign laws as well as laws in Hong Kong and Macao Regions , in strengthening administrative norms and making judicial interpretations of the antipiracy crackdown to make full use of legal weapons to crack down on piracy and protect intellectual property rights .  
In light of the rampant momentum of illegal publishing activities , in December 1998 , with emphasis from the central leading comrades , the Director of the Working Group on " Eliminating Pornography and Fighting Illegal Publications " , Wang Maolin , convened a conference attended by a dozen or so central organizations .  The conference studies ways to make full use of legal weapons and increase the use of criminal penalties .  
For illegal publications whose content was not pornographic or criminal , but which had not gone through the approval process , this judicial explanation made it clear that seriously lurid publications and the disruption of orderly markets could be punished as " illegal business operations " .  
Like their civilian counterparts , the legal affairs that military lawyers have to handle involve those relevant to criminal , civil , economic , administrative , maritime , and financial laws , and so they must be totally familiar with the laws and regulations of the country so that they can properly handle the legal affairs in the armed forces and legal affairs that involve both military and civilian departments ;  
However , in terms of law enforcement and construction of the ranks of cadres , there are some problems that can not be overlooked : The effort made in cracking down on criminal and economic crimes is not responsive to the needs of the current severe public security situation .  
All of the five cases were tracked out by Guangzhou City this year .  Among them , the four criminal cases concluded by the city intermediate court even startled the national leading group for wiping out pornography and cracking down on illegal publications and were major cases with a nationwide impact in the area of wiping out pornography and cracking down on illegal publications .  
The Macao police have also cultivated healthy trends and made energetic efforts to investigate and crack major cases ; have strengthened cooperation with the people and exchanged information or cooperated with the police forces in neighboring regions ; have severely cracked down on criminal activities , thus lowering the crime rate and raised the rate of cracking cases ;  
The rate of serious crimes committed during the first three quarters this year was lower by a great extent compared to the same period of 1999 , and the rate of cracking criminal cases has obviously risen high .  The violent criminal activities are being held back and have been hit .  The vast Macao people are clapping and are very happy .  
After launching a special campaign to crack down on criminal and vicious groups throughout the country , China has successfully destroyed some criminal and vicious groups , cracked down on a large number of major and serious criminal cases , and severely punished many criminals .  The people have clapped and cheered .  
However , some local criminal and vicious groups are rapidly developing and their activities are becoming more and more vicious in recent years .  They have been using extremely cruel measures , which seriously undermine public security in society .  They have gradually become destructive and harmful criminal groups of Mafia nature .  
According to a preliminary police investigation , Liu Qijun 's criminal gang was involved in a total of 14 criminal cases including killing , robbery , rape , illicit possession of firearms , arson , compulsory business dealings , crimes of affray , and hindrance of official duties .  As a result of the crimes committed by the gang , two people died , five people received serious injuries , and more than 20 people suffered light injuries .  
Similar to the criminal syndicates outside of Mainland China , domestic criminal and vicious groups have tried one-thousand and one ways to place themselves under a " protective umbrella . "  They have tried by hook or by crook to infiltrate into party and government organizations to seek political protection even to the point of directly seizing political power .  This is an extremely dangerous signal .  It is terribly harmful .  
Under the supervision of the Ministry of Public Security , the police authorities in Zhejiang had cracked down the " Zhang-Wang major case " of Mafia nature .  A hearing will be held soon .  The large criminal gang led Zhang Wei and Wang Xiufang is suspected of committing eight crimes including intentional homicide , unlawful detention , lending frauds , and so on .  
It is for this reason that Comrade Luo Gan put forward at the mobilization meeting that efforts must be made to ferret out and severely punish according to law the " protective umbrellas " and the backstage supporters in the party , government and judicial organs who support the criminal and vicious groups .  It is also essential to thoroughly destroy the social soil that breeds the criminal and vicious groups , he said .  
But since reform and opening up , under the influence of negative social effects and with the intrusive corrosion of overseas criminal syndicates , some criminal groups engaging in various serious felonious activities are gradually appearing in our country .  Their activities are becoming more and more rampant and the scales bigger and bigger .  Some have developed into criminal organizations with the character of a criminal syndicate .  
In sum , judicial and law-enforcing organs have punished the " Falungong " criminals , who disturbed social order with ulterior motives , not because they have practiced " Falungong " but because they have conducted unlawful and criminal activities and violated China 's laws .  
At around midnight yesterday , under unified arrangement of the Ministry of Public Security and the Public Security Department of Hubei Province , policemen from public security organs of Wuhan City were out in full force and doing their utmost to carry out a comprehensive and nonstop search for Jin Ruchao , the major criminal suspect in the Shijiazhuang explosions .  
It is necessary make cracking down on tax theft and fraudulent taxation , smuggling and other criminal activities that seriously damage the socialist market economic order an important task that is firmly grasped and coordinated with the relevant departments so that the market economic order can be corrected and codified .  
Over the past few years , the public security organs have adopted resolute measures to " strike at triad activities or weed out local tyrants ; " have ruthlessly cracked down on all types of illegal or criminal activities by cracking one batch of major or serious cases after another or rounding up in the net of law one criminal guilty of flagrant crimes after another ; and have thereby upheld justice , deterred crimes , or maintained social stability .  
The public security organs across the country should adhere to the principle of striking hard by ruthlessly cracking down on all types of criminal activities in accordance with the law .  At the moment , we should especially concentrate on cracking down on crimes of extreme violence , organized crimes , drug-related crimes , gun-related crimes , or explosive-related crimes and should resolutely weed out all criminal elements swollen with arrogance .  
The continual loss of resources of state authority and economic and fiscal resources supporting such authority resources makes the government 's command implementation mechanisms exist in name only , rendering the state totally incapable of fighting big entrenched benefit-distribution groups in society and criminal groups in society .  
In this exclusive campaign to " crack down on Mafia rings , " the Cixi City Public Security Bureau worked for over two months .  It destroyed in one stroke a particularly large Mafia-type criminal organization headed by Hunan criminal suspect Li Lixin and made up of 44 members that committed diverse crimes such as collecting and selling drugs , robbery , organized prostitution , and illegal possession of guns .  In which , it cracked over 40 cases .  
We must strictly hold the leading cadres concerned accountable for failure to attach importance to public order work , which results in major incidents or accidents , in inability to crack down for a long time on local major crimes and criminal forces , in failure to resolve major public order problems over a long period , and in failure to transform for a long time areas and units where public order is chaotic .  
In upholding the people 's democratic dictatorship , we must properly preserve national sovereignty , security , unity , and stability on the basis of people 's democracy , crack down hard according to law on lawbreaking and criminal activities that jeopardize the socialist system , reform , opening up , and socialist modernization , and people 's lives and property , and give full play to its role in protecting the people and cracking down on the enemy .  
can we crush the arrogance of criminal elements and boost the moral of the masses ; can we implement the various measures for comprehensive management of public security in real earnest ; and can we effectively ensure the healthy economic and social development .  
In the current struggle , we must create an awe-inspiring situation , fully mobilize the masses , strengthen mass prevention and mass treatment , and spread a far-lung network with which to prevent and crack down on crime so that criminal elements whose cases are serious will be held in awe and hit hard , and those who committed petty crimes will repent and make a fresh start and begin their lives anew .  
This meeting fully affirmed the results of the special campaign at the previous stage against smuggling , foreign exchange evasion , illegal foreign exchange remittance , and deceptive acquisition of tax reimbursement for export , as well as the joint operation against the law-breaking and criminal activities of producing and selling counterfeit and shoddy commodities ; thoroughly analyzed the severity and harmfulness of existing market economic disorder and the major causes of these problems ; set the principal tasks of rectifying and regulating the market economic order in the next five years and the work focuses this year ;  
The meeting pointed out : We must achieve phased results in the above-mentioned five respects in one year or so , so that the ongoing spread of law-breaking and criminal activities that seriously disrupt the market economic order will be markedly contained ; big and important cases that the people have strong resentment at , that have serious consequences and adverse repercussions will be exposed and dealt with ; criminal elements who break the law will be severely punished ;  
Liang Guoju , director of the provincial Public Security Department of Guangdong , called a special teleconference the other day to lay out tasks for public security organs throughout the province ; meanwhile , he urged all localities across the province to publicize in the coming few days each 's results in the comprehensive management of local social security , including the number of criminal rings of an underworld triad nature and the number of suspects that each locality had successfully smashed and arrested .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : In the future , if serious crimes and the activities of criminal gangs are not severely suppressed over a long period , if major law-and-order problems are not resolved effectively over a long period , if the chaotic conditions in public order are not changed over a long period , then local leading cadres and leaders of the relevant departments will be punished for neglecting their duties .  
At present , according to the arrangements of the State Council , actions should be focused on cracking down on the activities of making and selling counterfeit commodities , regularizing the construction market , punishing criminal offenders involved in tax evasion and tax frauds , breaking departmental monopoly and local blockade , straightening out the market for cultural products , thus laying a good foundation for the fundamental improvement of the order of the market economy in the period of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
Thus , the fight to uproot the evil forces must proceed along with consolidating the market 's economic order and with cracking down on crimes committed in the economic sector .  Law enforcement departments must take joint actions to investigate the economic crimes committed by organizations that operate like criminal syndicates , close their unlawful businesses , freeze their illegal capital , confiscate their unlawful incomes , and destroy their economic foundations that they count on to subsist and develop .  
The criminal syndicates and evil forces often use unscrupulous tactics to collect illegitimate wealth and frantically seek profits .  They use the syndicate to protect businesses , while letting the businesses " feed " the " syndicate . "  They have seriously disrupted the economic order of the state and hampered the reform and opening-up program and the smooth development of the socialist modernization drive .  
The vicious growth of criminal syndicates and evil forces has become a prominent issue that affects China 's public security and social order .  It has also become a major disaster that prevents the people from leading a peaceful and happy life .  
Corruption is a hotbed for breeding criminal syndicates and the evil forces .  Behind all the criminal syndicates cracked by the public security organs , there are always well-connected networks and " protective umbrellas " that are complicated and difficult to deal with .  
All these arguments , which confuse right and wrong and confound black and white , are attempts to cover up Japan 's criminal history of aggression with a " beautiful veil " and deceive the future generations so as to attain the aim of completely changing the traditional evaluation of the war of aggression .  
At the mass rally to openly mete out punishments to a batch of serious criminals in Chongqing Municipality , the public security bureau announced the arrests of 92 members of criminal gangs bearing the character of the Mafia , despotic hooligans , and suspected criminals in some serious cases , and announced administrative detentions of six suspected criminals .  
Besides , efforts will also be made to severely crack down on criminal activities that disturb the economic order , such as making and selling forged money , tax evasion and tax frauds , and producing fake goods .  Areas where the market order is seriously chaotic and numerous criminal cases have occurred and places where economic crimes have run rampant are regarded as key points in the strike-hard struggle .  
The State Planning Commission urged severely cracking down on serious criminal activities in the economic sector in active cooperation with relevant departments in carrying out the struggle to " strike hard " and put things in order , comprehensively strengthening public order and solving the pronounced problems facing market economic order , and striving for remarkable successes in this regard as quickly as possible .  
Only when strong pressure is always maintained on criminal elements and the haughty arrogance of criminal elements is crushed can social stability and public order move toward the direction of favorable development .  
The Supreme People 's Court today issued a circular , requiring that law courts at all levels throughout the country seriously implement the central arrangements , give full play to the role of their judicial function in trying criminal cases , rapidly devote all strength to the " hard striking " anticrime struggle , resolutely mete out severe punishments to criminal offenders according to the laws , effectively perform their important duties of punishing criminals , maintaining social and political stability , and protecting the life and property safety of the masses .  
The circular also urges courts at all levels to hold open trials on typical cases and explain the law in the light of criminal cases , thereby enabling the broad masses of people to continuously enhance the awareness and ability to use laws to protect and safeguard their own legitimate rights and interests , as well as fostering a prevail atmosphere of socialist business ethics of honesty and trust in the whole society through meting out severe punishments on crimes in disrupting the market economic order .  
and he was a recidivist .  In accordance with the relevant provisions of the criminal law , Shijiazhuang Intermediate People 's Court sentenced Jin Ruchao to death , with permanent deprivation of his political rights , under the charge of causing explosions and , separately , sentenced him to death , with permanent deprivation of his political rights , under the charge of voluntary manslaughter .  It ruled that the death penalty be executed and his political rights deprived for life .  
To address the grave situation of the increasing number of crimes and frequent accidents involving illegal use of explosives and guns , public security departments will launch a special six-month action to confiscate illegal explosives , guns , and ammunitions throughout the country ; severely strike at criminal activities involving the use of explosives and guns ; and severely punish criminal elements involved in the use of explosives and guns .  
The Supreme People 's Procuratorate urges procuratorial and public security organs throughout the country to incorporate the special operation into the unified plans for the nationwide " strike-hard " campaign , and to continue to intensify efforts on the pursuit and arrest work .  It is necessary to truly implement the state 's criminal law and policy by honoring the policy of leniency for suspects who voluntarily surrender to the authority and who take the initiative to return illicit money .  
The open announcements of verdicts on the trials of the exceptionally serious serial crimes of Zhang Jun and Li Zejun embodied the firm determination of the judicial organs to mete out heavy , swift and severe punishments on criminals in accordance with law and persist in dealing " sure , accurate and ruthless " blows on all kinds of criminal activities that seriously undermine public order . 
2 .  Criminals who have surrendered themselves within the time limit prescribed in this circular will be given light or reduced punishment .  For those whose crimes are relatively minor or who have behaved quite well by reporting and exposing others ' criminal acts , providing tips for cracking down on other criminal cases , stopping others from committing serious crimes , or assisting the public security department in arresting escaped criminals , more lenient treatment will be given in accordance with the law .  
All localities , in the light of local situations , should clearly set the objectives , focus on key tasks , and strive to achieve practical results .  We should not only decidedly wipe out criminal forces and pressure groups already uncovered , but also should expose criminal forces and pressure groups that have been lying low and have not been exposed and clamp down on them .  
With regard to the leading cadres and state organ personnel who exercised ineffective leadership in the special work to put things to rights , neglected their duties , or engaged in embezzlement must be sternly investigated and dealt with by the supervisory departments , and those who committed crime should be investigated to affix their criminal responsibility in accordance with the law .

In recent years , the nation has launched ad hoc campaigns to crack down on smuggling , tax evasion , tax fraud , foreign exchange fraud , production and sale of counterfeit and shoddy goods , and other illegal criminal activities .  These have achieved remarkable success and have played an important role in promoting the healthy development of the socialist market economy .  
For those regions where the rectification work is slack , market economic order is chaotic , and efforts to improve the situation have proved ineffective after a long period of time , those local government officials who are primarily responsible as well as relevant responsible persons must be held accountable in accordance with laws and disciplinary rules ; those who have committed crimes must be investigated on criminal grounds in accordance with the law .  
The meeting maintained that the Criminal Law amended at the Fifth Session of the Eighth National People 's Congress on 14 March 1997 made definite stipulations on punishing the criminal acts of destroying forest resources such as felling trees unlawfully , or cutting down woods and other forest trees without discrimination , which has played an important role in protecting forest resources and deterring criminal activities .

Since a national conference on social order work concluded , leaders at all levels have taken immediate action to mobilize people at all levels , make specific arrangements , muster and organize manpower , and set off an upsurge for our " strike hard " struggle with heavy fists and with an eye on rectifying social order .  Upon hearing this , criminal elements began trembling with fear and the people and masses started chapping their hands with joy .  
After several months of diligent work , the task force uncovered the truth about rampant fraudulent claims for export tax rebates by some of the localities , units , and enterprises in the Chaoshan region .  They investigated to check if some large , key cases , and political and legal agencies followed the law in arresting criminal elements engaged in fraud .  Corrupt elements in party and political agencies and law enforcement departments with ties to criminal elements on the outside were also uncovered .  
In this struggle against fraudulent claims for export tax rebates , all levels of government and relevant departments worked together , coordinating their steps and removing obstacles and interferences , combining forces to investigate large and key cases .  Regardless of what units or what persons were involved , all cases were investigated thoroughly , giving the perpetrators of fraudulent tax rebates no room to breathe , curbing the arrogance of criminal gangs , and recovering huge economic losses for the nation .  
After reviewing these cases , the Supreme People 's Court maintained that Huang Zhenchi , Lin Sucun , Huang Wenlong , and He Tao were found guilty of forging VAT receipts for unlawful benefits ; and that the receipts used for defrauding tax rebates involved inordinate amounts of money .  It said the lawbreakers must be harshly punished because their criminal offenses were particularly serious and the losses they had incurred to the state were huge .  
Accompanied by Hubei Governor Zhang Guoguang and other comrades , Luo Gan conducted investigation and study of the progress of the struggle to strike hard and put things in order from 11 to 15 May . He inspected units such as police substations , criminal police units , prisons , reform-through-labor camps , shopping malls , residential living quarters , and large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises , and paid a cordial call to express solicitude for the family members of a model public security policeman who died while on duty .

Severely striking out at gun running and drug trafficking is a key task in the public security frontier guards ' " strike-hard " struggle .  Frontier guards stationed in China 's southwestern border areas , including Yunnan and Guangxi , have concentrated their efforts on destroying gun smuggling and drug trafficking gangs , cutting off entry points for gun and drug smuggling , and severely punishing the criminal elements who are involved in exceptionally large gun and drug smuggling .  They have speedily launched their special actions to crack down on guns and drugs .

There are four types of conspicuous problems to be dealt with in this concentrated rectification ; The first consists of serious problems of violating law and discipline such as perverting justice for bribes , bending the law to serve friends or relatives , and engaging in bribery and graft , and in particular , serious problems of judicial corruption such as collusion with underworld forces and acting as an " umbrella " for lawless and criminal elements .

Those offending the criminal law should be brought to justice .

The court held that Liu Yunfang , Wang Jindong , Xue Hongjun and Liu Xiuqin had organized , planned , instigated and helped " Falungong " practitioners to carry out self-immolation and their acts constituted the crimes of international murder which should be seriously punished according to the law .  Liu Xiuqin only played a secondary role in the collaborated criminal act .  She was an accessory .

They will gear up the investigative effort in this field so as to prevent the spread of network-related crimes .

This reporter has learned from the Guangxi Regional Public Security Department that Guangxi began on 10 January a special campaign to check and seize illegal guns and ammunitions and to severely crack down on criminal activities involving guns .

We should make vigorous efforts to strengthen the building of political power at the grass-roots level in rural areas and turn them into strong fighting bastions to prevent and crack down on the criminal activities in abducting and trafficking in women and children .  
His aim and sinister ambition was to portray himself as a saint protecting the democracy and human rights of the 23 million people of Taiwan and to imply that the government of the Chinese mainland and the CPC , which oppose his criminal behavior , are an autocratic devil opposed to democracy and human rights , in a bid to stir up bad feeling between the Taiwan compatriots and the mainland of the motherland and pin on it the responsibility for the tense situation in the Taiwan strait and for a possible war .  
Li Peng stressed at the symposium : At present , juvenile delinquency has taken an upward trend in China ; and juvenile crimes tend to be committed at an increasingly younger age and by those criminal means that are generally employed by adults .  All this should be brought to the close attention of the entire society .  
Things are greatly different in the modern society ; however , judging from the vicious criminal cases committed by juveniles in recent years , we can see that a major factor leading to the situation lies with the education of families and schools , lies with the impractical mentality of parents who " hope their children to become dragons one day " as well as their way to " push their children to become dragons , " and lies with our stress on an exam-oriented education in the past instead of a quality education .  
Narcotics not only seriously corrode a person 's soul and make the drug addict psychopathic , distorted in personality , and lose his self-respect or even morals , but also has induced a lot of illegal and criminal activities and given rise to a lot of social evils such as the " supporting of narcotic consumption by stealing , snatching , prostitution , gambling , and drug trafficking . "  
Anti-narcotics law enforcement departments have always maintained a high-pressure posture of striking hard at narcotics-related illegal and criminal activities and persisted in rehabilitating every single drug addict , punishing every single drug trafficker , rooting out every single narcotic plant grown , and investigating and affixing the responsibility for every single case of narcotics production .  
The Mukang public security frontier inspection station is just dozen kilometers away from the drug-growing center known as the " Golden Triangle .

A responsible official of a relevant department in Fujian Province said on 22 June : The Fujian Provincial Government expressed deep regrets for the 58 alleged stowaways who suffocated in a container seated on a truck in Britain 's Dover port , and condemned the criminal act of international organized criminal syndicates .  
People remember that at the beginning of the founding of New China , the central government immediately took rigorous measures to launch a nationwide anti-narcotics campaign .  It seized narcotics , banned the planting of opium poppies , closed opium halls , sternly punished narcotics producing and trafficking activities , punished over 80,000 narcotics-related criminal elements , forced 20 million drug addicts to quit drug addiction , and eradicated opium poppy planting in conjunction with rural land reform .  
Having heard the cases related to the above three Burmese criminals and criminal Yan Zai , the Kunming city Intermediate People 's Court confirmed their crimes and acquired real and sufficient evidence .  The court maintained that their criminal activities had all violated the Criminal Law of the State , constituted crimes , and seriously produced great sabotage to society .  
However , since the international community has failed to launch a forceful crackdown on organized international criminal gangs owing to the loopholes in the laws of certain countries , such as " political asylum " and " respect for human rights , " the activities of illegal migration have been revived like dying cinders glowing again and have persisted despite repeated prohibitions , thus doing tremendous harm to the society .  
When handling cases and problems , political and law organs are urged to enhance consciousness in the comprehensive management of public order , and while cracking down on law-breaking and on criminal activities , to consider problems from the angle of crime prevention , to search for reasons for criminal activity and to discover loopholes in the law through the handling of cases , to put forward preventive measures , to help relevant departments improve management system , strengthen education on the legal system , and implement preventive measures .  
5 .

The results of the auditing show that in general the tasks in executing the 1999 central budget and managing and utilizing the state bonds special funds have been carried out well .

With regard to the recent tragic incident of illegal immigration , we also have had a common stand .  China is resolutely opposed to illegal immigration and has formulated strict laws and adopted stern measures to prevent it .  However , trans-national criminal gangs are rampant and very fraudulent .  
The Chinese Government , acting in accordance with the law , outlawed the " Falungong " cult and harshly censured the criminal elements that broke the law .  Especially after the local authorities ' deep-going and meticulous ideological education and enlightening efforts , the overwhelming majority of " Falungong " exercisers sobered up and awakened .  
Under the complicated struggles , officers and men of the judicial organs and armed police have taken a firm and clear-cut stand , forcefully attacked the national splittist forces and terrorist and violent criminal activities , and maintained stability of the overall social and political situation .  
Specialists maintain that establishing a large setup of civil justice and perfecting the three major systems of criminal , civil , and administrative justice will make the functions , duties , and judicial work of people 's courts more clear , scientific , and reasonable .  As a major readjustment of the civil justice , this will exert a positive and far-reaching influence on the practice and theoretical study of China 's justice .  
He said : Further efforts to expand and strengthen friendly cooperation between the two countries and their militaries in all fields , and joint efforts to strike at ethnic splittism that seriously threaten the stability of relevant nations and regional security , international terrorism , religious extremist forces , and transnational criminal activities , conform to the basic interests of the two countries and their peoples , and are of great significance to safeguarding peace , stability , and development in this region .  
32 .  Article 66 shall be changed to Article 67 and be revised as : " Any state organ functionary engaged in patent regulatory work or other state organ functionary concerned who neglects his duties , abuses his authority , or plays favoritism and commits irregularities shall , in conformity with legal provisions , be prosecuted for his criminal liability if his act constitutes a crime or be given disciplinary sanctions if his act does not constitute a crime . "

Zhu Rongji said that last year , we resolutely implemented the decision by the party Central Committee , dealt destructive blows at some criminal smuggling gangs , and obtained important results .  Politically , this showed the image of " opposing corruption and cracking down on crimes , and strictly enforcing law " of the party and the government .  Economically , smuggling cases involving nearly 80 billion yuan were cracked and the revenue from tariffs increased by more than 71 billion yuan over the previous year .  
Zhu Rongji pointed out that according to the experience in cracking down on smuggling last year , without improving and using advanced technical means and modern information technology , it is impossible to effectively crack down on the cunning criminal gangs and safeguard the economic legal system and national interests .  Therefore , at present , we must seize the time to improve the " golden customs project " and the " golden taxation project . "  
Through handling and reviewing criminal appeal cases , we are likely not only to strengthen our procuratorial organs ' capability of correcting mistakes on their own and ensure both strict and fair law enforcement on the part of our procuratorial organs but also to reverse some erroneous verdicts , rulings , or decisions ; exercise legal supervision over the judicial activities of some other organs ; and safeguard judicial justice in an effective way .  
Confusing right and wrong , some policemen harbored criminal offenders and were even indulgent with criminals .  Some policemen even served as protective umbrellas for evildoers and some directly engaged in smuggling and shielded smugglers ; as a result , the evil phenomena of pornography , gambling , and drugs still survive despite repeated crackdowns .  
It is necessary to protect the legal rights of the floating population , severely crack down on various criminals who are unworthily registered as members of the floating population , and establish a sound system of assistance provided for investigation by clues and tip-offs .  It is necessary to organize and develop a special struggle to trace and arrest fugitives by acting according to circumstances , and crack down hand in hand on cross-regional criminal activities .  
The State Administration of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Public Security recently issued a circular .  The circular points out : The criminal activities of producing and selling fake and shoddy commodities are very rampant at present , as law-breakers have resorted to all sorts of means to openly hinder , resist , and interfere in administrative law-enforcement in order to gain staggering profits .  
Because the profits gained through smuggling of illegal immigrants are equivalent to or exceed the huge profits gained through drug trafficking activities , with annual profits reaching more than $ 1 billion , international criminal cliques have spared no efforts to rush into the danger . 
Through initial investigations , it is believed that the [ incident of ] illegal immigrants hiding inside the container discovered by Hong Kong authorities this time was arranged by international criminal cliques .  They first went to Guangzhou from Fujian , then they entered Hong Kong in groups with round trip permits .  
Under such circumstances , international criminal cliques have adopted more concealed and roundabout smuggling tactics .  For example , the illegal immigrants captured by Hong Kong this time were arranged by criminals in Hong Kong . They falsely reported the material inside the containers .  
Zhu Rongji pointed out : The problems such as illegal immigration , sneaky intrusion into other countries , and so on exist in many countries , which is the transnational crime committed by international criminal groups and must be cracked down on with joint efforts .  
The State Council has recently decided to set up a National Small Group for the Coordination of Fighting Production of Fake Items in order to severely attack the criminal offense of production and sale of counterfeit goods and effectively organize a unified national operation to crack down on fake goods .  State Council Vice Premier Wu Bangguo will head the group .

Article 48In cases where mine inspectors abuse their power , are derelict in duty or are corrupt , should have discovered but failed to discover potential mine hazards or illegal behaviors which would affect mine safety , or fail to make a timely report of potential hazards or illegal behavior which would influence mine safety , or who are in violation of any condition listed in Article 19 of these present Regulations , if such behavior shall constitute a criminal act , criminal responsibility shall be determined ;  
The correct implementation of the criminal procedural law has played a positive role in safeguarding the rights and interests of citizens , dealing blows to criminal offenses , maintaining social stability , safeguarding the smooth implementation of economic construction , and administering the country in line with law .  
Jia Chunwang also emphatically pointed out : Chinese public security organs should resolutely crack down on sabotages schemed by Western hostile forces and elements ; resolutely crack down on illegal and criminal activities schemed by national separatists , violent terrorists , and religious forces ; and resolutely ban " Falungong " and other illegal cults and harshly crack down on their illegal and criminal activities according to law .  
Furthermore , they should closely serve the objectives and tasks of the " 10th Five-Year Plan " ; make relevant predictions and formulate countermeasures to deal with problems that might appear in the course of development ; strictly prevent and crack down on serious economic criminal activities including smuggling , fraudulence in foreign exchange transactions , obstruction of the order of financial management , financial fraudulence , and manufacturing and sales of fake and substandard commodities ;  
According to our information , Jiang Zemin stated at a recent Politburo meeting that it is necessary to hold accountable the leadership responsibility of the leading cadres concerned as well as the criminal responsibility of those cadres implicated in such a major case which involves many party , government , and army leaders at various levels and a contraband value of several score billions of yuan .  
Due to the close cooperation and coordination , various politics and law departments have severely cracked down on sabotage by hostile forces according to the law , timely handled and cracked down on the illegal and criminal activities of the cultic Falungong organization , and educated and transformed a number of Falungong criminal elements .  
The public information network supervision departments , which have been established by the provincial public security systems nationwide , recently held a meeting , summing up their work results over the past year .  The meeting said : Since their establishment , the public information network supervision departments across the country have successfully cracked down on Internet crimes and stopped the spreading of " harmful information " through the Internet . Internet police of the supervision centers in Guangdong , Fujian , Sichuan , and other places have successfully discovered many criminal cases from e-mails .  
Although the forms of expression and the numbers of people involved in criminal and evil forces vary between the coastal areas and the interior and between town and country , and some organizations are lax and some tight , their antisocial essence is completely identical and they do very great social harm .  
After illegally acquiring great wealth , the bosses of some criminal syndicate-style organizations suddenly change their identity by setting up companies , running factories , and acting as managers and bosses , protecting and nourishing their business through criminal activities , and doing everything possible to rope in and corrupt party , government , and judicial cadres and engage in graft in a big way so as to seek " protective umbrellas . "  
The crimes of criminal and evil forces of all kinds have already done serious damage to the stability of social order , seriously threatened the safety of the masses ' lives and property , seriously damaged order in socialist market economy and in social management , corrupted the party , government , and judicial cadre force , eroded grassroots political power , and ruined the party style and social mood .  
With regard to the current serious state of activities committed by criminal and evil forces , the leading central comrades have given important instructions on many occasions specifically demanding that the public security organs crack down severely according to law to totally eliminate the evil ;  
As important instruments of the people 's democratic dictatorship , it is the sacred duty of the public security organs to crack down hard on the crimes of criminal and evil forces , ensure the smooth progress of reforms , opening up , and economic construction , and ensure that the masses can live and work in peace .  
Since Henan Province police developed great strength and impetus in their anti-crime special struggle , they have destroyed a total of 800 vicious criminal gangs that had Mafia qualities , and unearthed many important cases that had caused serious damage and were a terrible influence , and they have blocked the vicious criminal force from spreading .  
To assure the actual result of the anti-crime special struggle , the public security bureau of Henan Province made sure that 100 criminal gangs with Mafia qualities , vicious force , and hegemony and 20 severe criminal cases have registered supervision and are being followed and guided , supervised during the whole progress , and being recorded for every case to keep track and to close the cases as soon as possible .  
In those places , departments , and units where major criminal cases , public security problems and disasters , and social unrest have occurred , an investigation must be conducted to determine relevant leaders ' party disciplinary , administrative disciplinary , and legal liabilities .  It is necessary to exercise one-vote veto authority .  We must never allow criminals to go unpunished .  
For some time now , certain lawless elements have vigorously engaged in manufacturing and selling counterfeit and inferior goods and fraudulently obtaining export tax rebates , for the sake of reaping vast profits ; and some have banded together to form harmful syndicate-style criminal organizations .  
The meeting called on public security organs at all levels to act in line with the central authorities ' plans , actively participate in the joint operations to deal strict blows to criminal activities of manufacturing and selling fake and inferior commodities , and the special struggle to deal strict blows to the fraud of export tax rebates , evasion and cheating in foreign exchange payments , and other criminal activities .  
To obtain windfall profits , some criminal elements build connections with leading cadres in various ways and corrupt them by bribing them with a large amount of money or through providing them with sexual services .  Over-concentration of power in some cadres , a lack of transparency in the exercise of power as well as a lack of an effective oversight and check system against abuse of powers give rise to corruption like the exchange of power for money .  In addition , because of the state 's limited financial power , public servants ' pay is low .  
In improving the order of market the economy and developing the functions of customs , we should mainly launch incessant struggles against smuggling , work in coordination with concerned departments to crack down on tax rebate fraud , illegal remittance and procurement of foreign exchange and other criminal activities .  We should standardize various operations related to imports and exports , and maintain normal order in imports and exports .  
In order to preserve social stability and tranquillity and protect basic human rights and freedoms , the Chinese Government has banned the " Falungong " organization and punished according to law a very small number of lawless and criminal elements ; and it has carried out thorough and meticulous work to educate and convert the great majority of those who were led astray , to enable them to return to a normal life .  
He asked various units to work in close coordination , give full play to the advantage of joint struggle of all public security organizations , consider the work of tracing and arresting criminal suspects as a special task , make overall and proper arrangements , and strive to achieve practical results .  
The special struggle arranged by the Ministry of Public Security against criminal syndicates and evil forces has produced initial success ; we must unremittingly pay close attention to it to completely root out criminal syndicates and evil forces in all localities .  In particular , we must resolutely crack down on their " protective umbrellas " and severely punish according to law whoever is involved .  
The special police contingent of the criminal police corps of the Beijing municipal public security bureau is a specialized force formed in view of Beijing 's development into an international metropolis .  
While inspecting the contingent 's vehicles and other equipment , Luo Gan said : In cracking criminal cases , the public security people 's police usually faces extremely cruel criminals ; therefore , our criminal and special police forces should be very competent and skillful and well equipped in order to ensure that the enemy is most forcefully dealt with and they themselves are most effectively protected .  
Wang Ming , vice president of the Beijing Higher People 's Court and senior judge who has been engaging in criminal judicial work for a long time , pointed out : After the state banned " Falungong " heretic cult organizations in line with the law , Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " heretical cult organizations have continued to openly publicize false reasoning and fallacies to defile the government and slander against other people .  These acts have violated China 's Constitution and relevant provisions of the law and are evidently harmful to society .  
Some experts and scholars in the scientific and technological circles of the capital city recently held a special symposium .  Experts and scholars attending the meeting expressed great indignation against the criminal activity of the evil " Falungong " cult by misleading and instigating some obsessed " Falungong " practitioners under its mental control to commit suicide by setting fire on themselves .  
Participating jurists pointed out that Li Hongzhi and his evil " Falungong " cult were the plotters and instigators of the case in which a number of stubborn " Falungong " members set themselves on fire at Tienanmen Square . By doing so these " Falungong " members did themselves bodily harm , abused human rights , and seriously broke China 's criminal law .  It is necessary to crack down on these people according to law to guard the authority and sanctity of the law and to maintain political stability and unity .  
She Mengiao , secretary of the party group and executive vice chairman of the China Law Society , called at the meeting on jurists and lawyers around the country to gain a complete understanding of the evil nature of " Falungong " and make full use of the legal weapons in their hands to crack down on criminal activities carried out by the " Falungong " cult organization and educate and redeem stubborn " Falungong " members so as to remove the social cancer , making their due contributions .  
We should further intensify comprehensive management of public order , crack down hard on various criminal activities in accordance with the law , and wage a special struggle against " triads and evil forces , " with the focus on homicide , explosion , and gun-related grave violence crimes and gang crimes , as well as serious economic crimes .  
Leading cadres at all levels must " stress politics " in their day-to-day work , hold firm on cardinal questions of right and wrong , and resolutely wage a solemn struggle against the unlawful and criminal acts of the " Falungong " cult , in order to safeguard the excellent situation marked by stability and unity .  
As disclosed , the reason why the Shenyang people 's deputies were dissatisfied with the city court and city procuratorate 's reports was that this city has in recent years seen a series of shocking cases - - including party and government officials ' corruption cases , major cases involving criminal syndicates , and shooting cases - - some of which even bothered Zhongnanhai and required the central authorities ' direct intervention in the investigation and handling .  
Talking about the relationship between handling Falungong and guaranteeing human rights , Liu said : The policy of the Chinese government in handling the Falungong problem is to unite with , educate , and saving most of the practitioners who have been deceived .  The Chinese government has punished a small handful of people in the Falungong cult because they have engaged in illegal and criminal activities , disrupted public order , and violated the Chinese law .  
As vice minister of public security and deputy head of the national leading group for cracking down on smuggling , Li Jizhou assumed the important responsibility of struggling against smuggling and other criminal activities .  However , he abused his authority , sought personal benefits , and seriously obstructed public security organs ' normal law enforcement activities .  The gravity of his discipline - and law-breaking act has seriously damaged the party and government 's prestige among the masses and resulted in bad political and social influence .  
According to the Public Security organs ' preliminary investigation , this incident of self-immolation was totally the result of Li Hongzhi 's poisoning , confusion , instigation , and mental manipulation of " Falungong " fanatics , and it was an organized , premeditated , and planned criminal activity undertaken with measured steps .  
Meanwhile , the legal system with Chinese characteristics that constitutes seven legal categories - - the constitution and constitution-related laws , civil law and commercial law , administrative law , economic law , social law , criminal law , as well as law of procedure and law of extra-judicial procedure - - is rather complete .  Most of the basic and major laws in each legal category have been enacted .  
Han Zhubin said : Procuratorial organs at various levels consistently focused on the investigation and handling of important cases of crime committed by cadres ranking at and above the county or provincial section level and major criminal cases involving large sums of money , causing great harm , and having a high profile .  In total , they placed on file for investigation 18,086 cases of grafting and bribes taking amounting to 50,000 yuan and over .  Among them , there were 1,335 exceptionally large cases involving over 1 million yuan each .  
In view of the fact that the number of suspects of corruption , bribery , and misappropriation of public funds absconding with huge sums of money had increased in recent years , at the end of last year , the SPP and the Ministry of Public Security jointly organized a dedicated campaign for tracking down fugitives .  So far , nearly 300 suspects at large involved in major criminal corruption and bribery cases have fallen into the net of justice .  
In close coordination with relevant departments , procuratorial organs upheld the principle of " cracking down on crimes , " and meted out punishment according to the law to the offenders of serious crimes that had endangered the country 's state security , economic security , and social order , Han Zhubin indicated .  During the past year , a total of 715,333 criminal suspects were arrested , among whom 708,836 were prosecuted by the state .  
In the development of western China , procuratorial organs in western China prosecuted more than 300 cases relevant to crimes committed in handling key construction projects , ravaging the ecological environment , and mismanaging money and goods meant for people stricken by poverty and natural disasters ; and authorized the arrest of 3,891 criminal suspects who destroyed communications , energy , or telecommunications infrastructure or ravaged the ecological environment .  
The people 's courts have carefully heard criminal cases of organizing and using the " Falungong " cult to sabotage the implementation of laws , cause deaths , gather crowds to disrupt social order , print illegal publications , conduct and spread cult propaganda , and so on , in strict accordance with the criminal law and applicable judicial interpretations .  
This year , the procuratorial organizations will emphasize the supervision of investigation and prosecution , detection , hearing , and execution of punishment in criminal cases , and also the supervision of trial of civil and administrative cases .  Stress will be laid on preventing job related crimes in coordination with financial , securities , customs , medical and pharmaceutical , building and other trades .  
According to report by reporter Zhang Jingyong from the meeting of the education group , in their discussions , the committee members held that last year , the Supreme People 's Court and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate strictly performed their judicial and prosecuting functions , severely punished various types of criminal offenders on the basis of laws , protected the legitimate interests of the masses , and played an important role in maintaining social stability .  
In the new year , the Supreme People 's Court and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate should orient their work to the general tasks of the party and the state , aim at maintaining social stability and promoting economic construction , persistently uphold judicial fairness , harshly punish criminal offenders and corrupt elements , and provide effective judicial guarantees and legal services for reform , opening up , and the development of the socialist market economy .  
Deputy Ping Ziliang , who is a professor of Inner Mongolia Teachers ' University , said : Last year , through dealing harsh blows at various types of serious criminal offenders , the judicial and procuratorial organs played a great role in guaranteeing that the people could live and work in a peaceful and safe environment , and at the same time , they also provided a good preconditions and guarantee for economic development .  
Though being a typical criminal case in nature , the incident has laid bare serious problems in school management as well , such as people without fixed duties in the society being allowed to enter a school as they please , the absence of a strong sense of security or prevention in schools , and the failure to enforce forceful protection measures or tight security in schools .  
The notice stated : Since the explosion incident broke out in the school on 6 March , the public security departments have carried out thorough-going investigations ; gathered evidence ; defined the incident as a typical criminal case ;  
Apart from the above , more efforts should be devoted to improving the public order by taking comprehensive measures , punishing by law all kinds of criminal activities that endanger our social and national security , and banning " Falungong " and other evil cults in accordance with law so as to further ensure our social stability .  
Legal circles have different methods for demarcating the legal departments , and the Standing Committee will initially divide the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics into seven legal departments in line with the actual requirements of legislative work ; these departments are the constitution and related laws , civil and commercial law , administrative law , economic law , social law , criminal law , and procedural and non-procedural law .

Speaking at a welcoming ceremony hosted by BDB , Mr Ng said that the co-operation between the Police of both sides in combating cross-boundary crimes was necessary as the two places were adjacent to each other and social and economic contacts were frequent .  " Sharing experience and the exchange of intelligence are vital to intercept Vietnamese boat people and cracking down on smuggling , illegal immigration and criminal activities at sea , " Mr Ng said .  
While fully committed to developing in-house expertise in criminal proceedings , Mr Cross also noted the importance of promoting a strong , experienced and independent Bar , " we remain wedded to the belief that there are legitimate public interest reasons why some prosecution work should be briefed out to the private sector , " he said .  
* granting the court a discretion to direct that the question of admissibility be dealt with in the presence of the jury , coupled with a lowering of the standard of proof for determining voluntariness to that of civil proceedings ( on " a balance of probabilities " ) , rather than the existing criminal standard ( " beyond reasonable doubt " ) .  
Mr Stoker said that the Commission has reached no firm view as to which of these options should be pursued , and was seeking the views of the public .  He said that while the Commission invited comment principally on the specific options for procedural reform identified in the consultation paper , it would also welcome thoughts on other means of improving the present procedure in jury trials for determining the admissibility of confession statements in criminal cases .  
My own department 's efforts to facilitate the increased use of Chinese in the law have continued . 32 seminars , mock trials and workshops relating to bilingual advocacy were organised during 1998 ; a Bilingual Legal Documents Unit was established in the Civil Division of my department ; the Bilingual Court Documents Unit continues to translate materials for use in criminal proceedings ; the third edition of the English-Chinese Glossary of Legal Terms has been published ; and preparation of the first edition of a Chinese-English Glossary is underway . 
As a high standard of proof is required for " criminal offences " , it is often more difficult to convict complicated commercial crimes and takes a great deal of resources and time to establish a case .  As such , the criminal approach to deal with market misconduct may not necessarily have a stronger deferent effect on committed offenders .  
" Any person failing to comply with a statutory order without reasonable excuse is guilty of a criminal offence under the Buildings Ordinance and may be prosecuted in Court . The maximum penalty is one year imprisonment and a fine of $ 50,000 plus a daily fine of $ 5,000 , " he said .  
Apart from incorporating systematically a lot of the existing separate criminal regulations and subsidiary provisions into the new Criminal Law , certain concepts have been reformed , including the incorporation of the principle of " everyone is equal before the law " , abolition of the system of " analogy " , adoption of the system of " crime and punishment being prescribed by law " , substitution of the controversial " crime of counter-revolution " with a more clearly-defined " crime of endangering national security " .  
Today 's legal aid system has grown to one which covers all criminal cases and a wide range of civil cases including matrimonial disputes , personal injuries claims , employment disputes , contractual disputes , to name a few . 
Today 's legal aid system has grown to one which covers all criminal cases and a wide range of civil cases including matrimonial disputes , personal injuries claims , employment disputes , contractual disputes , to name but a few .  
In that short period , many crucial legal issues have been addressed .  These include the status of the Provisional Legislative Council , the adaptation of laws programme , the criminal jurisdiction of Mainland courts over cross-boundary activities , the right of abode issue , and the constitutionality of laws protecting the national and regional flags .  
As an alternative to the civil proceedings before the MMT , the Bill preserves and expands the existing criminal route for dealing with market misconduct activities , to be resorted to when there is sufficient evidence to meet the criminal standard and it is in the public interest to bring prosecution before the courts .  
In the foreword of the Hong Kong Police Review 1999 , which was published today ( May 21 ) , Mr Hui noted that the continuing climate of economic uncertainty and social hardship resulting from the Asian financial crisis had an inevitable effect on both the number and types of crimes committed , with continued evidence of increased crime related to the downturn in the economy , including cases of criminal intimidation related to debt-collecting malpractices and quick-cash crimes such as pick-pocketing and snatching . 
" There have still been wild stories flying around in the international media that Hong Kong 's economic autonomy has been greatly eroded , that the Beijing Government is interfering in Hong Kong 's administration , that Hong Kong is the base of diversion for the PLA to smuggle controlled items into China and that Chinese owned firms in Hong Kong escape prosecution for gross criminal acts .  
" We aim to achieve our vision of international recognition of excellence as an integral part of the Hong Kong criminal justice system , through efforts in achieving value for money , public confidence , staff morale and public safety in the provision of quality custodial care and comprehensive rehabilitation programmes compatible with human dignity . "  
Following extensive investigations into complaints received in June this year against criminal intimidation and blackmail perpetrated by suspected triad personalities connected with a loan sharking syndicate , officers from the Mong Kok district crime headquarters conducted an undercover operation and raided various commercial and residential premises in the territory today .  
As an increased deterrent and to punish market misconduct , the Bill will retain , modernize and expand the existing criminal regime to deal with market misconduct where there is sufficient evidence that a criminal offence has been committed by an identifiable person , that there is a reasonable prospect of a conviction , and that it is in the public interest to bring a prosecution .  
In November last year , a first group of anglophone counsel from my department attended an excellent English language course in Mainland law at Peking University . The course included lectures on the legal system and government structure in the Mainland , and on the latest developments in constitutional , criminal , civil and administrative law .  
BL 48 gives a detailed account of the manifold functions of the CE . He is responsible for leading the government of the Region , signing bills and promulgating laws , signing budgets and issuing executive orders .  He has the power to appoint and remove judges , and report to the CPG for appointment and removal of principal officials .  He can pardon persons convicted of criminal offences or commute their penalties , and on behalf of the HKSAR , conduct external affairs as authorized by the CPG .  
Mr Tsang said the Force had established and maintained a clear strategy for ensuring safety and stability , mostly through a strong uniformed presence on the streets , effective and immediate response to all incidents , professional training of personnel and use of modern equipment , thorough investigations of all crime reports , development and maintenance of an effective criminal intelligence network , and comprehensive crime prevention programmes in all frontline Police Districts . 
To achieve this goal , the Administration needs not only day-to-day co-operation at the operational level , but also a durable and rules-based framework for co-operation in the administration of criminal justice .  This includes the establishment of a statutory framework for the rendition of fugitive offenders , the transfer of sentenced prisoners and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters .  
To achieve this goal , we need not only day-to-day co-operation at the operational level , but also a durable and rules-based framework for co-operation in the administration of criminal justice .  This includes the establishment of a statutory framework for the rendition of fugitive offenders , the transfer of sentenced prisoners and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters .  
The crime cases involving human life are almost part of everyday 's news .  In solving a crime case , witnesses are , of course , crucial .  Besides , the dead body itself can also reveal critical physical evidence such as cause of death , sequence of events surrounding the death , and persons involving in the crime case .  Forensic science is what we call today to scientifically collect physical evidence of a crime for criminal detection .  
Behind this internationally accepted definition is the consensus that there is a qualitative difference between terrorist acts capable of inflicting massive and indiscriminate injury and damage to the public and ordinary criminal activities , such as criminal damage , assault or even murder . 
Factors that are taken into account include the nature and gravity of the criminal or disciplinary offence laid against the officer ; possibility of the same offence recurring if the officer remains in office ; availability of suitable posts for re-deploying the officer ; and likely public perception .  We interdict an officer only when re-deployment to alternative duties is not possible or inappropriate .  
" When the Commissioner took up office in January 2001 , he directed that the Force focus on the maintenance of a strong visible uniform presence on our streets , provide a fast effective response to emergencies , strengthen the Force criminal intelligence system , enlist public assistance in fighting crime as well as further enhancing our liaison with Mainland and overseas law enforcement authorities to combat cross-border crime .

The VCD comprises 12 short episodes , each lasting about three minutes , and features crimes such as triad activities at schools , trafficking in dangerous drugs , selling pirated goods , internet related crimes , common assault , shoplifting , criminal damage , indecent assault and sexual intercourse with underage girl .  
Mr Lo said : " The earlier conflicts of interests in Yuen Long have led to a series of violent acts by the two triad societies including wounding , criminal damage and arson which seriously endangered the life of the residents .  Thus , the Police planned an operation targeting the illicit activities of these two triad gangs and implemented the operation codenamed Mullington in late June with a view to dealing a blow on the gangs . "  
Exercise of these powers should normally be confined to fires of doubtful or suspicious origin , i.e . fires suspected to have been caused by arson or to have involved any other criminal offence , or the cause of which can not be determined after initial investigation .  
Under our proposals , which are based on the existing law , ' protected information ' only includes five tightly defined categories of information relating to : ( i ) security and intelligence ; ( ii ) defence ; ( iii ) international relations ; ( iv ) relations between the Central Authorities of the PRC and Hong Kong ; and ( v ) the commission of offences and criminal investigations .  
We have therefore decided to define the relevant activities more precisely to mean " illegal access " of protected information , which would only mean specified criminal acts , that is unauthorized access to computer by telecommunication , access to computer with criminal or dishonest intent , theft , robbery , burglary or bribery .  
Should the ISSOs be the subject matter of legal proceedings decisive of an individual 's civil rights and obligations or criminal liability , the content of the relevant Orders will be the subject of argument and interpretation in a public hearing and published in a judgment made public , as required by Article 10 of the Hong Kong Bill or Rights Ordinance , Cap . 383 which implements Article 14 ( 1 ) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
Apart from " quick cash crime " , Mr Chau noted that the other major crime category that had registered an increase in the first half of this year was " anti-social crime " such as serious assault , assaulting police , criminal intimidation , arson , resisting arrest , criminal damage , and disorderly / fighting in public place .  
The motive force behind progress is the pursuit of wealth . But even if people are well off , if they lack viable moral standards , then unrest and criminal behavior may arise . So we must set up a stable , ethical , harmonious society in which wealth is evenly distributed .  
If all goes well with the experiment , the lay assessor 's court can be fully effected without serious problem . ( 2 ) It was also decided the types of written court verdicts should be simplified , and that besides looking into such simplification during amendment of the civil and criminal laws , the Compulsory Execution Law could be amended to give executing authorities the right to consult tax records to avoid hiding of property or false claims of debt .  
Big stock players , wealthy businessmen , and the owners of construction firms - - the " highrisk groups " that are prime targets for criminal attacks - - have become apprehensive and fearful , hiring security teams to protect their homes and bodyguards when they go out and even giving up their imported limos for inconspicuous domestic sedans .  
That is to say , the younger those who have been arrested and imprisoned are at the first offense , the more likely is the possibility they will be repeat or serious offenders later . This is because on the inside not only are they able to learn even more " specialized " criminal techniques , after they get out , because they have been " labelled " as bad guys , it is difficult to go straight .  
The civil officials judge the good and the bad - - the military carry out the punishment ; ox-headed and horse-faced demon messengers from purgatory detain the criminal and the gold and silver generals put him or her in a cangue ; the white messenger of death turns his eyes up fiercely and sticks out his tongue , while the black messenger carries the arrest warrant . You can not help but tremble in such a sinister atmosphere .  
For someone who has never before been in con tact with drug addicts , the stereotype is closely connected to that of criminal society , with large dark eyebrows over brooding , threatening eyes leading into a violent , powder keg personality . Little did we expect that when we got to the rehabilitation center we would find that the patients were no different from the run-of-the-mill .  
Loopholes in the law " The Voice of Taiwan " violated criminal laws , was investigated by the prosecutor 's office which found sufficient evidence to act , and then was closed down for its unlawful behavior . Meanwhile , the " Green Peace Taiwan Cultural Broadcasting Station " and " Taiwan News Transfer " have not been set up in accord with legal procedures . They should have applied to set up , and by not doing so they have violated their responsibilities under the Broadcasting Law . These are two different situations .  
Tsai says that the song was written about a friend of his who was imprisoned for being in a criminal gang . The friend had applied for leave from prison to visit his sick grandmother . When he was refused , he escaped from jail . When he was discovered and reincarcerated , his sentence was raised from five to 12 years .  
Traditional Chinese placed great emphasis on proper rituals or patterns of behavior , and failure to observe these was deemed to be criminal . For example , these days a lack of filial piety is considered to be a personal moral problem , in which outsiders should not get too involved . But in the past it was a serious offense . Not only could the individual be punished through the state legal system , family law was even more rigorous and inescapable , and violators were expelled from the clan .  
As the harmful effects of drugs came to be understood , drug trafficking changed from being legal to being a criminal offense around the world . There has been a significant trend toward international cooperation in fighting the drug trade . Producer , transshipment , and consumer nations have joined hands to clamp down at every link in the chain . Only in this way can narcotics activities be completely rooted out .  
Minister of Justice Liao , fully engaged in the campaign to crack down on illegal behavior in all areas of life , suggests that the Sung case shows the serious extent of the penetration of religious groups by criminal gangs ; this has already become part of his professional territory . Taipei City Mayor Chen Shui-bian also announced a crackdown on criminally connected shrines to begin on October 15 .  
Lin feels that this is the unfair result of women 's Catch-22 position in society . At any rate , Lin believes that buddying around with the police , having a broad set of personal connections , and being familiar with a lot of bizarre criminal tactics are n't really directly relevant to whether or not a person can direct a case .  
Kan adds an even more ridiculous case of how hard it has been to change men 's attitudes . In ROC criminal law , rape is defined as a " crime damaging to social morality . " In other words , according to the legal interpretation , the real evil in rape is that it offends the requirement for women to remain chaste and virtuous . As for the woman , it seems that the violation of her person is secondary !  
To avoid seeing all responsibility pushed onto " a small number of bad guys , " feminists often draw attention to structural factors : women made into sex objects in TV ads , the highpriced bargirl culture where businessmen socialize , paternalistic family structures that place higher value on men than women . They point to all the " repressive " behaviors that are a builtin part of daily life , arguing that these are the true roots of rampant sexual criminal behavior .  
The Academia Sinica 's Chiao Hsingkai notes that it is often overlooked that both sexual harassment and rape are repeat offenses . If undiscovered , over a long period an offender may repeatedly play his degrading games . As for how he chooses his victims , that is still uncertain . However , it is often the case that the criminal will pick the easiestlooking target : young , unsophisticated , genteel looking girls .  
For instance , in the Four Pillars case , if the firm is found guilty , there will be criminal fines ( under the EEA , the maximum fine is US $ 5 million ) , as well as possible compensation in the civil suit . One can imagine a scenario in which all the profits for encroaching on intellectual rights over these past few years will enter the coffers of the American government and the original manufacturer , meaning that the efforts of the copying firms were all for other people 's gain .  
On October 13 , police in Hsinchu County 's Chutung Precinct broke a shocking criminal case involving youths-thirteen teenagers , both male and female , had confined a 14-year old girl to a room , beaten her to death , and then buried her body .  
Twenty years ago , people watched Taiwan 's Little League teams fighting for glory abroad on late night TV . A few days ago , people stayed up all night watching a live marathon program , directed by and starring a major criminal . Then came the elections for county and city executives . After the excitement generated by political " stars , " the victory of the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) has rewritten the political map of Taiwan .  
Old hunting grounds have been claimed by the state , with every tree and blade of grass strictly protected . With heavy punishments imposed from above , and the attraction of external economic opportunities , the social status of hunters has dropped precipitously , from an honored class to a virtually criminal class .  
Some years ago , Mai Jan-mei was director of guidance at another Taipei middle school , located in one of the city 's most infamous criminal areas . At that time some pupils formed a gang and began causing trouble . They padded their left shoulders up high and went around the school terrorizing the other children ; even teachers did n't dare mess with them .  
Fa Chih-pin , a professor of law at Chengchih University , points out that early on most countries included slander and libel in criminal law . After World War II , with strengthened calls from international organizations to protect human rights , the problems of finding people guilty for slander and libel under criminal law gradually began to become apparent . " The major difference between criminal and civil law is that people can be locked up under criminal law , and when people are in jail they clearly do n't have freedom to speak and publish . "  
For instance , Chen Chih-hsiang , a judge in the criminal division of the Taipei District Court , has petitioned for three constitutional interpretations : one on whether third-time drug abuse offenders should be subject to mandatory life imprisonment or death ; another on whether the scope for compensation under the Regulations on Applications for the Restitution of Citizens ' Rights Violated Under Martial Law was too narrowly defined and the requirements for documentary evidence too rigorous ; and a third on whether mandatory life imprisonment or death for drug traffickers was unconstitutional .  
In late 1997 , in response to the general sense of powerlessness throughout society that year following three major criminal cases , an epidemic of porcine foot and mouth disease and the Asian financial crisis , Huang Wu-hsiung again wrote an article putting forward the idea of community colleges . In it he stated : " The aim is not only to provide the public with lifelong opportunities for education , but also to revitalize Taiwanese society through knowledge and discussion , the operation of civic groups and the exchange of skills . "  
After joining the faculty at New Haven University , Li used the university 's chemical analysis laboratory to help the police investigate criminal cases on numerous occasions . In 1979 , the Connecticut state police hired Li outright as their senior forensics expert , and he then rose through a number of positions to become the head of the entire Connecticut state police force in July , 1989 .  
The importance of the human factor can not be overlooked . No matter how sophisticated forensic techniques are , and no matter how advanced scientific instruments may become , the key to success will always be how well the practitioner makes use of his tools . The core elements of scientific criminal investigation are broad knowledge , finely honed powers of observation , and a combination of bold imagination and cautious search for proof .  
On October 16 , Justice Minister Yeh Chin-fong convened a conference of senior police officers , public prosecutors and government anti-corruption units from the six county and city administrations of central Taiwan . They decided to closely monitor the borrowing of architect licenses and the involvement of mafia in public construction projects , so as to prevent corruption among civil servants . They agreed to impose severe penalties for criminal activities relating to reconstruction projects .  
From the " Nine Chapters " of the esteemed Han minister of state Xiao He-which covered , among other things , lawsuits , standards for arrest , and criminal punishments for robbery and theft-to the later marriage laws , there were 906 volumes under more than 60 separate legal headings . If you add to this supplementary sources of law , like precedents and debates by legal scholars , then the Han code could handle everything that is covered by both statute and customary law in the modern world .  
Internally , there are a number of worrying problems - " black gold politics " ( the confluence of criminal gangs , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians ) , rising crime , and only erratic environmental consciousness . It is urgent to achieve consensus on these problems in order to find solutions .  
On May 24 , Premier Tang Fei convened the first session of the new cabinet and outlined six major goals for future administration : ensuring national security and improving cross-strait relations ; eliminating " black gold " ( criminal and corrupt influence in politics and big business ) and raising the standard of living ; speeding up reconstruction work in the September 21 earthquake disaster area ; deepening the industrial structure and recreating the economic miracle ; deepening education reform and strengthening culture ; and promoting the reinvention of government and the raising of administrative efficiency .  
He further indicated that he has instructed all security organs that they " are not to carry out surveillance against specific political parties or individuals . " At the same time , said the president , these organs must be diligent in all matters related to national security , economic security , major criminal activity , maintenance of social order , and any other matters that fall within their legal jurisdiction .  
I wanted to stand up and testify in my personal status-as a writer who was imprisoned , shackled , and beaten because I insisted on freedom of speech and refused to bow down before authoritarianism ; and as a " thought criminal " for whom a military court sought the death penalty-to the fact that the dark ages are over in Taiwan , and that mothers will no longer have to cry for political reasons .  
Not long afterwards , he was arrested by the Japanese military for a cartoon in a newspaper depicting a famous Chinese general from the Ming dynasty killing a " dwarf pirate . " ( " Dwarf pirate " has long been a derogatory term used by Chinese to refer to Japanese . ) He thereby became categorized as a " Chinese juvenile political criminal . "  
The law dated from 1930 , and although it had been revised in the intervening years , it contained much that no longer suited the times . Rather than embarking on a major overhaul , it was deemed easier just to junk the whole thing . ( Of course , the commercial , criminal , and tax codes still apply to the publishing industry . ) Opening the market to foreign investment was seen as the best way to prepare the publishing industry for the challenges of WTO membership .  
According to a handbook entitled Medical Disputes Q &amp; A compiled by the Taiwan Health Reform Foundation , the types of redress most patients and their families wish for are : a reasonable explanation ; a sincere apology from the hospital and doctors ; financial responsibility to be taken for the continuing medical care of the patient ; hospitals and doctors to learn lessons ; proposals for specific reform measures ; action to prevent similar mistakes happening again ; substantive punishment for wrongdoers ; reasonable monetary damages or compensation ; and only last of all , criminal penalties .  
What 's more , criminal gangs began to control many of the venues , and related incidents were the subject of frequent unflattering press reports . Because of an underworld disagreement , gang leader Yang Shuang-wu shot and injured singer Kao Ling-feng at one such establishment in Kaohsiung . The incident shocked Taiwan , and many started to view these places as dens of iniquity . Attendance fell markedly .  
The body 's immune responses to these germs-cell-mediated immunity , which is called " type 1 immune response , " and the " type 2 immune response , " known as humoral immunity-are mutually antagonistic . This can result in imbalances , much like when the police deploy all their forces to catch a big criminal and end up letting small-time thieves slip through the net . To an allergic person 's immune system , finding the right balance is as difficult as it is for a seesaw to stay horizontal with children on it .  
The Ministry of Finance should rigorously investigate and hold banks accountable for administrative and criminal liability in this area . Next time a financial institution is found to have leaked customers ' confidential information , the paper suggests , it should be penalized by being barred or restricted from opening new branches or starting new lines of business .  
Effective action at the global level was crucial in preventing and controlling the accumulation of illicit profits and in contributing to the impoverishment and weakening of criminal organizations .  
It was also stressed that the computerization of criminal justice systems should be applied at the national and international levels , with due consideration given to the standards prevailing in both developed and developing countries .  
" Alarmed also by the ability of organized criminal groups to transcend national frontiers , taking advantage of regional arrangements designed to foster free trade and of the gaps in national legislation and international cooperation ,  
Eight years have elapsed since the barbarous aggression against our people , when the three criminal terrorist States moved , with black hatred , against our innocent children , our women and our elderly in a desperate attempt to harm our great people .  
The aim was to establish that , if an organization was held to be criminal , it entailed the possibility of an individual member being found guilty in subsequent proceedings before lesser ( national ) courts of the victorious Powers .  
The idea of applying national law at the level of international law to compensate for lacunae in substantive criminal law is worth considering as a transitional measure , although the manner in which this is effected will require deliberate study .  
The Conference stressed that all persons who perpetrated or authorized criminal acts associated with ethnic cleansing were individually responsible and accountable for such human rights violations .  
Turning to the new draft statute for an international criminal court , she said that it was a definite improvement over the previous draft , since it completed issues that were unsettled or insufficiently addressed .  
Accordingly , an international criminal court that rested on firm legal and institutional bases and enjoyed wide acceptance could serve as an effective instrument for bringing the perpetrators of such crimes to justice .  
The large number of regional conflicts in which international humanitarian law and human rights were seriously violated indicated that there was an urgent need to take practical steps to achieve a form of universal criminal jurisdiction .  
The establishment of an international criminal court involved many complex and difficult issues , such as jurisdiction , applicable law , court structure , prosecution and other matters which must be addressed with utmost care .  The meeting rose at 1.10 p.m .  
Another major obstacle is the broad range of activities in which transnational crime is involved , which are not always covered or sanctioned by existing criminal legislation .  
The difficult question of the qualifications of the judges ( art . 6 ) was handled well , although it was regrettable that a rigid distinction was drawn between judges with criminal trial experience and judges with recognized competence in international law .  
Because controls on growing trade and communication had been unable to keep pace with organized criminal activities , there was an urgent need to elaborate an improved response by criminal justice authorities world wide .  
Also convinced that through their own national legal and judicial systems States must provide appropriate civil , criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights ,  
Also convinced that through their own national legal and judicial systems States must provide appropriate civil , criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights ,  
Concerning article 6 of the Convention , members of the Committee took note of the information contained in the State party 's report that , for acts prohibited under article 4 of the Convention , national legislation provided that criminal or civil proceedings in respect of offences were not subject to any statute of limitations and that compensation or redress was available in cases where administrative decisions violated the provisions of the Constitution or the Convention .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism and criminal acts , as well as illegal drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
The causes are many : the earlier supply of weapons to client States by the parties to the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets , criminal activity and the collapse of governmental law and order functions ( which both gives free rein to the criminals and creates a legitimate reason for ordinary citizens to acquire weapons for their own defence ) .  
In its interim report ( S / 1994 / 1125 ) , the Commission submitted its preliminary conclusions on serious breaches of international humanitarian law and acts of genocide committed in Rwanda , and recommended that the individuals responsible for those acts be brought to justice before an independent and impartial international criminal tribunal .  
Violence was seen as a vicious circle repeating itself from generation to generation but one that was not irreversible and that could be addressed through multidisciplinary cooperation at the national level , greater condemnation of violence against women and children reflected in criminal justice systems , and programmes to prevent violent behaviour and provide better treatment for victims .  
A collection of data on the status and implementation of existing multilateral , regional and bilateral agreements relating to international terrorism , including information on incidents caused by international terrorism and criminal prosecutions and sentencing , based on information received from the depositaries of those agreements and from Member States ;  
In particular , many delegations noted with satisfaction that by establishing a system of international criminal jurisdiction based primarily on the consent of the States concerned with the alleged crime and complementary to existing national jurisdictions and procedures for international judicial cooperation in criminal matters , the draft reconciled the need for an international criminal court and respect for State sovereignty .  
Thus , it was suggested that the creation of a single international criminal court would better serve the rule of law by offering fuller guarantees of the objective , impartial and uniform application of the future Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind than would ephemeral , ad hoc jurisdictions .  
Another representative noted that the draft statute lacked clarity in that there was no indication as to whether that complementary relationship would be a hierarchical type of relationship , or whether the international criminal court would be given an advisory role vis - - vis national courts or even be competent to vary the decisions of the latter in application of international law .  
Thus , it was stated that the establishment of an international criminal court , with the subsidiary organs mentioned in article 5 and other infrastructures , would entail an enormous financial outlay which might be an extra burden for developing countries .  
It was stated that , if established under the Charter , the Court would be supported by the Organization 's moral authority and its universality , and furthermore the unity of the international legal order in respect of criminal matters would be assured .  
It was also stated that the sensitive issue of national criminal jurisdiction , as well as the principle of State sovereignty , would make express prior consent of States a prerequisite for the establishment of the Court as a system of international criminal jurisdiction .  
The fact that the statute was primarily a procedural instrument underscored , in the view of many delegations , the importance of developing an applicable substantive law to circumscribe more clearly the jurisdiction ratione materiae of the Court so that the two fundamental principles of criminal law , nullum crimen sine lege and nulla poena sine lege , might be respected .  
In this context it was noted that , since international criminal law was not a fully developed area and since the statute of the Court was certain to have an impact upon national legal systems , the jurisdiction should be established on a consensual basis in full regard to the fundamental principle of sovereignty , which should be reflected in all its provisions .  
Another representative pointed out that the idea of applying national law at the level of international law to compensate for lacunae in substantive criminal law as regards the constituent elements of crimes and the penalties to be imposed was worth considering , although the manner in which that was effected would require careful study .  
The above notwithstanding , the wording of subparagraph ( c ) providing that the Court should apply " to the extent applicable , any rule of national law " was considered as too vague by some representatives , who called for more specific language bearing in mind that international law did not yet contain a complete statement of substantive and procedural criminal law . 
Another representative , after pointing out that the draft statute contained no provisions on statutory limitations or on their non-applicability , observed that , if a permanent international criminal court was to become a reality , the Court 's jurisdiction ratione temporis would have to be determined in order to preserve the principle of legal safety . 
The view was also expressed that subparagraphs ( a ) and 2 ( b ) were in blatant contradiction with article 14 , paragraph 7 , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , and that account should also be taken of the fact that the purpose of an international criminal court was to be complementary to national criminal justice systems , as stated in the preamble to the draft statute . 
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups that engage in the production of , traffic in and distribution of drugs , arms and precursors and essential chemicals , which at times places them beyond the reach of the law , corrupting institutions , undermining the full exercise of human rights and threatening the stability of many societies in the world ,  
With regard to the possibility that special laws or exclusive jurisdictions could be invoked to uphold impunity in respect of human rights violations , a careful study has begun of Guatemalan domestic legislation , with special reference to the military criminal justice system and the identification of cases in which the functioning of this special system could promote impunity .  
The Mission recommends that criminal legislation should be amended so as to incorporate in it a specific description of the crime of torture , making it punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account its grave nature , as required in the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , which has been ratified by Guatemala .  
Also convinced that through their own national legal and judicial systems States must provide appropriate civil , criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights ,  
Specifically , the court could be entitled to require , in accordance with the statute and rules of procedure , that national courts should refer a case to the international criminal court for consideration if the offence which gave rise to the institution of proceedings is regarded as a criminal offence of a general nature , if the national court is not independent or impartial or if proceedings have been initiated with a view to exempting a suspect from international criminal liability .  
A permanent international criminal court has been eagerly awaited by human rights advocates and Governments alike for more than half a century , and the document prepared by the Commission is a milestone in this direction .  
The first concern is that the judges of the international criminal court will have made a public and solemn undertaking under article 14 to exercise their functions under the statute " impartially and conscientiously " and in fairness to this judicial oath a dissenting judge should perhaps be allowed to make his dissent known where the judgement does not express the unanimous opinion of the judges .  
One organization asserted that this recommendation was unfortunately silent on existing mechanisms for inter-agency meetings on public information issues covering high-priority agenda items such as social and economic development , crime prevention and criminal justice , human rights , environment and sustainable development , women and development , population and refugees .  
The establishment of an international criminal court to try individuals charged with crimes that pose a threat to international peace and security , violate basic human rights and forcibly subject others to torture in all its forms is a worthy objective sought by the international community .  
Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 49 / 53 and the relevant request of the Legal Counsel , UNDCP and CPCJB have reviewed the draft statute for an international criminal court contained in the report of the International Law Commission on the work of its forty-sixth session .  3 / The review was carried out in the light of the legislative mandates of both bodies and from the point of view of their substantive competence .  
While the principle of the severity of the offence is sound in view of the need to address the multitude of activities engaged in by organized transnational criminal groups , further elaboration is needed in the light of the differing national perceptions of the severity of individual offences .  
Indeed , in such cases the legal rules governing jurisdiction would not be applicable , the criminal laws of the State that would normally have jurisdiction might be inadequate or there might be particular circumstances on the ground ( disorganization of the judicial apparatus , partiality of the courts because of internal or external conflict , a deliberate refusal to prosecute or extradite ) impeding the administration of justice .  
The third preambular paragraph of the draft statute reiterates the guiding principle that the international criminal court " is intended to be complementary to national criminal justice systems in cases where such trial procedures many not be available or may be ineffective " . 
As a country that is a frequent target for international terrorists and narcotics traffickers , the United States is properly concerned that the work of an international criminal court not compromise important , complex and costly investigations carried out by its criminal , justice or military authorities .  28 .  For the most part , neither drug crimes nor crimes of terrorism occur as isolated criminal acts .  
Effective investigation and prosecution at the national level and close bilateral and multilateral cooperation by countries around the world is essential to addressing the grave problems caused by ongoing criminal enterprises .  
Any interference by the Prosecutor of the international criminal court in this national and bilateral investigative work could jeopardize bringing criminals to justice and have the unfortunate result of the Prosecutor acting as a shield to effective law enforcement .  
It believes that establishing a linkage between the Security Council , which is a political organ by nature and by virtue of its mandate and structure , and the international criminal court , whose establishment is intended to provide a neutral and impartial legal forum , will create enormous problems that will undermine confidence in the court 's neutrality and impartiality .  
The recommendations covered several key issues , including the importance of crime prevention and criminal justice , individual and collective security and safety measures in Islamic society , the impact of transnational crime ( such as organized crime and illicit drug trafficking ) in the region , and future measures concerning regional and international collaboration against crime .  
Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that this tragic incident must not be used for ethically unacceptable and inappropriate political manipulations that espouse the myth that all the sides in Bosnia and Herzegovina should be seen in the same criminal light and as having the same responsibility for the evil that has engulfed my country for more than three years .  
It was emphasized that the proposed court should be established as a body whose jurisdiction would complement that of national courts and existing procedures for international judicial cooperation in criminal matters and that its jurisdiction should be limited to the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole .  
The duty imposed on the Prosecutor in paragraph 1 raised once again the difficulties involved in reconciling the respective responsibilities of the international criminal court and those of national authorities .  
The sectoral advisory services cover programmes relating to human rights , global development issues and policies , energy , human settlements , trade and development , population , natural resources , social development , public administration and finance , crime prevention and criminal justice , statistics and emergency humanitarian assistance .  
On the contrary , through its implementation the Government has induced financial institutions to get to know their customers better and undertake a specific and direct surveillance of transactions in order to prevent their being used as instruments for the illegal concealment , handling , investment or use of money or other goods coming not only from drug-trafficking activities but from any other kind of criminal activity .  
In addition to addressing these issues at a national level , the programmes also assist States in fighting transnational crime , including organized criminal activity , economic and environmental criminality and money-laundering .  
Because corrupt activities on the part of public officials can destroy the potential effectiveness of governmental programmes , hinder development and victimize individuals and groups , it is important that adequate criminal laws , including procedural legislation , be adopted to allow a recourse to sanctions and ensure an effective deterrence .  
Pursuant to article 17 of the statute , it is responsible for the Tribunal 's administration but also for setting up the infrastructure required to ensure the proper functioning of the judicial process in a particularly sensitive and important area of criminal law .  
All those working at the Tribunal realize the historic role which they have to play in setting precedents for future international criminal organs , notably a permanent criminal court - " the missing link of international law " - and they have watched with great interest the tentative moves towards turning the United Nations International Law Commission 's draft statute for a permanent criminal court into a viable court .  
A collection of data on the status and implementation of existing multilateral , regional and bilateral agreements relating to international terrorism , including information on incidents caused by international terrorism and criminal prosecutions and sentencing , based on information received from the depositaries of those agreements and from Member States ;  
They included " Action against national and transnational economic and organized crime and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment : national experiences and international cooperation " , which was considered in a plenary session , with a special session on corruption .  
Following unscrupulous and criminal aggression against Krajina and the genocide committed against the Serb people , Croatia advances untrue , baseless and malicious charges of the alleged involvement of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in incidents around Osijek with the aim of drawing Yugoslavia in the conflict that Croatia itself provoked .  
Today , it is impossible to deny the existence of private entities and public bodies which , under a legal cover , conduct clandestine criminal operations as a parallel activity by hiring people who , in exchange for payment , agree to participate in the commission of unconscionable and illegal acts .  
There have also been infamous cases in which State intelligence authorities or security forces , opposition groups , armed domestic resistance movements or criminal organizations hire mercenaries to engage in illegal actions such as forming paramilitary forces for purposes of repression , organizing death squads or providing military protection for illicit drug trafficking , smuggling or arms trafficking .  
In any case , the possibility of changing this criterion should be analysed and debated with a view to revising current international provisions on the subject , in the light of experiences where nationality has been used to mask the mercenary nature of illicit activities engaged in by a Power that recruits , prepares and pays an individual to perpetrate a criminal act against another country , its Government , its property or a given sector of its population .  
While mercenaries are typically present in situations of armed conflict , it would be incorrect to limit the description to those cases alone , since it applies to any situation in which the sovereignty of States , the self-determination of peoples , political stability and the human rights of populations are affected in a premeditated fashion by operations in which the active agent is a foreign mercenary specially hired to carry out unlawful criminal acts .  
The implementation of the international instruments for mutual assistance in criminal matters and of the model treaties on different aspects of bilateral and multilateral cooperation also requires technical assistance , and efforts have been made to provide this , beginning with the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) countries of western Africa . 
In response to the acknowledged need to strengthen the operational capacity of the United Nations programme , UNDP , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies were called upon to support technical cooperation activities devoted to strengthening the rule of law , in cooperation with the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , including proper coordination and fund-raising efforts .  
That was to include the provision of technical assistance for the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements , based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources , and the drafting of proposed model legislation or agreements on international cooperation in criminal matters , alternative or complementary articles for existing model treaties , and articles for possible model multilateral instruments .  
The feasibility of establishing an integrated system for the periodic gathering and dissemination of information on national crime prevention and criminal justice legislation and its implementation was to be determined , with a view to encouraging appropriate alignment in international cooperation through such means as extradition and other modalities of mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
The Council stressed the importance of continuing to improve the operational activities of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , particularly in developing countries and countries in transition , through advisory services and training programmes , field studies and action-oriented research at the international , regional , subregional , national and local levels .  
The crime prevention and criminal justice programme , including its network of institutes , could usefully be included in the new combined promotional and operational TCDC activities , and priority undertakings such as the replication of successful innovative projects , development of subject-specific TCDC products , promotion of joint strategies to deal with the problems faced by groups of countries , and mobilization of support , including triangular cooperative arrangements .  
Efforts had to take into account the current political situation and the ease with which organized criminal groups crossed borders and took advantage of efforts designed to bring countries closer together and increase the free movement of goods , capital , services and people .  
In their search for new opportunities and markets , organized criminal groups were ready to make sizeable investments in both equipment and human resources and were willing to bring their huge financial power to bear , in addition to using other more violent methods , for eliminating competition .  
The prospect of organized criminal groups infiltrating and attaining controlling interests in crucial sectors of the economies of developing countries and countries in transition had contributed to raising awareness and increasing concern among Governments , particularly at a time of joint efforts towards economic restructuring on the basis of free market principles .  
However , while developed countries already possess the infrastructure and crucial knowledge required in mustering the necessary resources and maximizing their efficiency and effectiveness , developing countries and countries in transition are found in the very difficult position of easily being outpaced by organized criminal groups .  
In the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , States recognized , while acknowledging its global implications , that prevention and control of organized transnational crime must necessarily vary from State to State and region to region and be based upon improvements in national capabilities , increased knowledge and shared experiences about organized criminal groups .  
Further , Governments are alarmed by the increasing involvement of organized transnational crime in legitimate business , coupled with the need of organized criminal groups to find ways of laundering their illicit proceeds .  
The new responsibilities that Governments have to take on because of the escalation of organized transnational crime and the demand for global strategies to combat it , draw attention to the need for effective instruments , bearing in mind that what is most needed is a comprehensive , multi-layered approach to international cooperation in law enforcement and criminal justice in the fight against organized transnational crime .  
One of the major objectives of international cooperation must be to create greater harmonization in criminal justice systems , by improving the standards of countries with weaker criminal justice systems in general or by developing national legislation specifically directed against organized crime .  
However , in the presence of a strong political will and broad consensus , as evidenced by the priority attached to action against organized transnational crime and the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , it would be possible to ensure that the negotiation process does not result in a diluted document that falls short of establishing the provisions necessary for an effective response to transnational criminal organizations .  
It should also consider conditions that are conducive to the rise and growth of criminal organizations , such as social , economic and political factors , structural characteristics of organized crime , as well as organizational shortcomings in the control agencies .  
In particular , it was recommended that States examine the experience of countries that have confronted organized crime and the intelligence derived from the analysis of its structures and criminal activities , as useful guiding principles concerning which substantive , procedural and regulatory legislation and organizational structures are necessary to combat the phenomenon .  
In the area of substantive legislation , efforts against organized transnational crime would be considerably strengthened through the introduction of reforms focused on criminalization of participation in a criminal organization , criminalization of conspiracy or similar forms of inchoate offences , prohibition of laundering of criminal proceeds , and sanctions and other measures , such as the confiscation of illicit proceeds , aimed at defeating the economic power of criminal organizations .  
The Government of Cuba has made considerable efforts to mitigate the traumatic effects of the criminal blockade on the Cuban nation and has tried to ensure , with the limited resources available to the country , that food and medicines are equally distributed among the people and that the levels of medical care , education , security and social welfare are maintained .  
They called for the speedy establishment of a permanent international criminal court that would prosecute perpetrators of massive violations of human rights , including perpetrators of egregious acts of racial discrimination .  
In order to be included in the list of crimes in the draft Code , such infractions must correspond to the legal rules accepted by States , must be considered serious enough to be defined as crimes against the peace and security of mankind , and must refer to acts sufficiently identifiable to appear in a criminal text .  The matter should be dealt with only from a legal , not a political , perspective .  
In the strong belief that concrete , broad strategies must be developed and applied to fight corruption , we reiterate our commitment to adopt cooperation mechanisms to combat that criminal activity because it weakens the democratic system , undermines the prestige of its institutions and constitutes an agent of social disintegration and distortion of the economic system .  
Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering , and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals ,  
MOCHOCHOKO ( Lesotho ) said that the draft statute was a considerable improvement over the earlier draft , but needed to be further strengthened to ensure that it created a just , fair and effective international criminal institution .  
Ad hoc tribunals could not be a substitute for a permanent international criminal court with the ability to prosecute persons accused of gross violations of humanitarian and human rights law wherever the crimes were committed .  
Only when national trial procedures proved ineffectual or inefficient in deciding such cases would the international community be entitled to have them dealt with by the international criminal court .  
Further discussion of the major issues involved would be required , with a view to the establishment of an effective international criminal court which enjoyed moral authority , independence and universal support .  
These heinous criminal acts , however , were preceded by 170 counts of barbaric and random rocket attack on civilian targets in the heavily crowded residential sectors of the city on 11 November 1995 , which caused the death of 39 citizens of the capital , including schoolgirls and a team of film-makers , and vast destruction of the city , in this regard , I submitted a letter dated 13 November 1995 addressed to you ( see S / 1995 / 950 ) . 
the imbalance between the increasing responsibilities that the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council had given that Branch and the institutional and financial means at its disposal could not be ignored , especially in the light of the growing crime rate , which was directly related to the tremendous corrupting power and the increasingly sophisticated methods of criminal organizations .  
a decision adopted on 28 April 1995 , the High Council of the Republic , the transitional parliament , bearing in mind all the adverse consequences for the Zairians which resulted from the presence of refugees from Rwanda and Burundi , including ecological problems , criminal acts and attempts to dominate the indigenous inhabitants , had decided to demand the unconditional return , without delay , of all refugees and immigrants from those countries .  
situation was critical in certain border provinces , which , overburdened by the provision of enormous financial , material and human resources in the fight against such criminal activities , should receive the support of the international community .  
flow of men and mat �� iel , not to mention the direct involvement of the military leaders of the former Republic of Yugoslavia , played a very important role in the brutal and criminal overrunning of the safe areas , in contravention of all the Security Council resolutions on the matter , and led to the exodus of tens of thousands of civilians and the liquidation of thousands of unarmed men and boys .  
Specific requirements should be identified for bilateral and multilateral cooperation in capacity-building and the training of civil servants in the areas of economic and financial management , the creation of jobs , the eradication of poverty , the provision of adequate criminal justice infrastructures and environmental protection .  
The sixth and last is the growing menace of organized criminal gangs purveying terror , deadly weapons , illicit drugs , indentured labour , and the bodies of our women and children across international borders .  
The uncharted waters ahead remain daunting , defined by bilious seas of unrelenting , sophisticated , transnational criminal activity , which is tearing at the very fabric of society .  
The present momentum for the establishment of a permanent international criminal tribunal should not be lost , but should be matched by commensurate political will to ensure that the work is completed in time for a conference in 1998 .  
Georgia , having undergone the tragedy of conflict in Abkhazia , and having experienced ethnic cleansing and genocide in its own population , is keenly interested in the rapid establishment and effective functioning of an international criminal court .  
It should be marked by a constant , unfailing mobilization of efforts to dismantle the criminal chain of terrorism , including those who are perpetrators , those who are behind them , the various political networks and their sources of financing and supply , and the direct or indirect logistical support given by individuals , groups or States .  
In the case of illicit transfers , however , given their particular subversive nature , which relies on international criminal organizations , countries should focus on improved national legislative measures and their effective implementation , as well as on improving international cooperation and coordination to prevent illegal transfers .  
Decide to combine their efforts to establish effective legal and judicial cooperation in the prevention of crime , especially transnational and organized crime , and the strengthening of criminal justice systems by developing and promoting international instruments pertaining to criminal justice , such as agreements concerning trafficking in women and children , genocide , war crimes , terrorism and drug-related offences .  
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
An operator of the Peruvian Telephone Company ( Jir \ x { 93ee } Washington exchange ) , in Lima , received an anonymous telephone call from an alleged terrorist criminal ( a male voice ) which announced : " We are going to place an explosive device on the fourth floor " .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups that engage in the production of , traffic in and distribution of drugs , arms and precursors and essential chemicals , which at times places them beyond the reach of the law , corrupting institutions , undermining the full exercise of human rights and threatening the stability of many societies in the world ,  
Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals ,  
Recognizing that the new forms of criminal activities of international drug trafficking organizations call for enhanced international cooperation , as well as a renewal of the international commitment to fight against these menaces , and require the formulation of new strategies , approaches and objectives which , respectful of the sovereignty of States , can deal more effectively with the international operations of those involved in the illegal traffic of drugs and arms , the diversion of precursors and essential chemicals , and money laundering through financial and non-financial operations ,  
SRIWIDJAJA ( Indonesia ) said it was vital that the jurisdiction of the international criminal court should be universally accepted , and he concurred with the view that the court should be established as an independent judicial organ by means of a multilateral treaty , as recommended by the International Law Commission .  
Regarding the principle of complementarity , which had some bearing on the relationship between the international criminal court and national judicial systems , the statute prescribed that the court should complement national criminal justice systems in cases where national trial proceedings had proved ineffective .  
That principle created a presumption in favour of national jurisdiction for the reasons contained in the report of the Ad Hoc Committee , namely that the parties concerned would work within existing bilateral and multilateral arrangements , applicable law would be more certain , criminal actions would be less costly and the penalties involved would be clearly defined and easy to enforce .  
AKL ( Lebanon ) said that he would welcome the establishment , by means of a multilateral treaty , of an international criminal court as a permanent and independent judicial organ which would have relations with the United Nations system that would guarantee its authority , universality , and administrative and financial viability .  
Reaffirms the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services as a means for the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme to respond to the needs of the international community in the face of both national and transnational criminality and to assist Member States in achieving the goals of preventing crime within and among States and improving the response to crime , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 46 / 152 and in line with the recommendations of the Ninth Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to facilitate , as appropriate , the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts ;  
Calls upon the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice at country level and , in pursuance of their mandates , to include such activities in their programmes , emphasizing social development aspects and utilizing the expertise of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme in such activities and cooperating closely on relevant technical assistance projects and advisory missions ;  
Several representatives reported that new structures had been set up to strengthen the office of the Attorney-General in their respective States to investigate and take action against criminal organizations , while others reported the adoption of measures to make judicial cooperation more flexible and transparent , particularly with regard to extradition and mutual assistance . 
The Centre is developing a technical assistance and advisory programme aimed at assisting China in building the necessary administrative and legal structures in the area of criminal law and criminal justice in accordance with democratic principles and respect for human rights .  
98 A series of instructional and educational meetings were held between October 1994 and June 1995 for young lawyers from Siracusa and a number of local conferences and one national seminar were held during the period under review , dealing with numerous aspects of criminal justice , including the role of justice of the peace and penal procedural matters ( priority theme C ) .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 , requested the Secretary-General to facilitate the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects , benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts .  
Under the general supervision of the Registrar , assisted by the Deputy Registrar ( D-1 ) , the service would include six legal officers responsible for : court management and judicial administration ( 1 P-5 ) ; international humanitarian law , criminal law and coordinating the work of legal clerks assisting the Chambers , and general administrative legal issues ( 3-P-4 ) ; and judicial administration in the implementation of directives on the assignment of defence counsel and legal research including in the area of witness protection ( 2 P-3 ) .  
The Minister of the Interior stated that the Sudan could possibly be more successful in its efforts to locate the suspects provided it received full cooperation from the relevant Ethiopian and Egyptian agencies and provided the matter was treated as a criminal case ; he added that , if the case was treated as a political issue , all efforts of the Sudan would be in vain .  
In addition , the Council recommended that the expert group should , in the light of the discussion at the workshop held during the Ninth Congress , explore ways and means of increasing the efficiency of extradition and related mechanisms of international cooperation in criminal matters , having due regard to the rule of law and the protection of human rights , including where appropriate such measures as : ( a ) the provision of technical assistance in the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources ;  
During its fourth world conference on crime prevention and criminal justice , held at Bangkok from 15 to 17 November 1995 , the Asia Crime Prevention Foundation decided , inter alia , to establish a working group with the aim of studying the issues of extradition and mutual legal assistance in Asia and the Pacific , taking into account other experiences at the regional and international levels .  
Stressing that all forms of repression and cruel and inhuman treatment of women and children committed by belligerents in the course of military operations or in occupied territories , including taking them hostage , their imprisonment , the destruction of their dwellings and their forcible eviction , should be considered criminal ,  
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
In that resolution , the Assembly dealt with the matter from a criminological perspective , inviting Member States to adopt specific measures to make the crime prevention and criminal justice system more responsive to domestic violence , for example , by enacting criminal law and procedure and improving the situation and the fair treatment of the female victim .  
The participants in the workshop made the following recommendations , applicable to countries in central and eastern Europe : criminal law and procedure should be reviewed to determine any discriminatory provisions and effects ; consideration should be given to making rape in marriage a criminal offence ; criminal justice practitioners should be sensitized to the dynamics of domestic violence ; the police should be given specific and intensive training in crisis intervention and in the collection of evidence in domestic disputes .  
It reported that national action to combat organized crime and the illegal movement of persons across international frontiers fell into three categories : ( a ) legislative measures , which included prohibition and provided for imposition of criminal penalties for involvement in such activities ; ( b ) administrative measures , which included the establishment of agencies to deal with such activities , as well as the provision of appropriate training to enhance efficiency ; and ( c ) technical measures , which included preventive and investigative action .  
Given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , is crucial , and measures need to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
The General Assembly in resolution 50 / 146 , paragraph 9 , requested the Secretary-General to facilitate , as appropriate , the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly UNDP Programme and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts .  
44 The observers of non-governmental organizations and individual experts at the Ninth Congress as well as at the fourth session of the Commission fulfilled an important function , particularly by making statements in their capacity as observers on the substantive topics of the agendas , based on their extensive experiences as practitioners working in the field or as distinguished scholars in the area of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
A number of countries reported that cases against law enforcement officials charged with crimes connected with the infliction , instigation or toleration of any act of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment were heard by regular domestic criminal courts .  
With full respect for the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of each country , and within the context of juridical arrangements established with other States , coordinate efforts to combat criminal organizations engaged in migrant trafficking .  
During the special plenary session of the Congress devoted to technical cooperation , it was stated that technical cooperation was indispensable to building and supporting both democratic institutions and effective criminal justice systems .  
It was also noted that further modalities had to be explored in addition to the existing forms of providing technical assistance , including advisory services aimed at drafting new legislation , at adapting model laws , and at developing comprehensive national criminal legislation , training activities , exchange of information , and assistance provided as part of peace-keeping operations .  
9 The General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 of 21 December 1995 , recognized the direct relevance of crime prevention and criminal justice to sustained development , stability , security and improved quality of life , as well as the urgent need to increase technical cooperation activities to assist countries , particularly developing countries and countries in transition , with their efforts in translating United Nations policy guidelines into practice .  
The recipients , selected among 106 nominees from Africa , Asia , Latin America and the Caribbean , eastern Europe and the CIS , focused their work on a wide range of topics , such as illegal arms and drug trafficking , money-laundering , organized crime , reform of the correctional system , juvenile delinquency , computerization of criminal justice information and crime prevention .  
In this regard , it is important to recall that the World Conference of the Asia Crime Prevention Foundation , held at Bangkok from 15 to 17 November 1995 , decided that the Foundation , in cooperation with the Division , should sponsor a comprehensive technical cooperation and assistance programme with special emphasis on : institutional reform and upgrading of criminal justice institutions ; organization of training courses and seminars aimed at human resources development ; and formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects in developing countries .  
The new criminal provisions against money-laundering were based on the assumption that money-laundering could be defined as the systematic disguising of illegal assets , using the scope offered by the legal financial market , with a view to shielding them from seizure by the criminal prosecution authorities and preserving their economic value .  
The legislation regulating the use of cash exceeding 20-million liras ensured the identification of bank and financial brokers , and imposed upon them the obligation to inform the Questore of all suspicious transactions , without incurring penal and administrative sanctions because their collaboration exonerated them from criminal liability .  
The two strategies followed by Mexico in this field were as follows : ( a ) establishing channels for communication of intelligence and information that would make it possible to expand the knowledge base in each country and to enhance the process of communication with countries that possessed more advanced techniques ; and ( b ) international cooperation in combating criminal activities that frustrated the efforts of Governments to fulfil their commitment to promote human rights , fundamental freedoms and democratic decision-making .  
The major characteristics of the draft law might be summarized as follows : ( a ) money-laundering would be established as an offence with a broader definition , covering the proceeds of crime as money and monetary instruments , property and proceeds derived from any criminal activity ; ( b ) a confiscation provision with a broader coverage than existing provisions had been included ; ( c ) freezing and seizing of assets had been covered in specific provisions ; and ( d ) controlled delivery had been introduced for the first time .  
The adoption of the 1988 Convention not only marked the first decisive step in mobilizing the international community in the fight against illicit drug trafficking , but also defined money-laundering offences and required parties to the Convention to proscribe them as serious criminal offences that would be severely punished and subject to extradition .  
In its resolution 1995 / 27 , section II , the Council requested the Secretary-General to consider the feasibility of establishing an integrated system for the periodic gathering and dissemination of information on national legislation in crime prevention and criminal justice and its implementation , taking into account the current and planned capabilities of the United Nations Crime and Justice Information Network and the activities of other United Nations entities and relevant intergovernmental organizations .  
In addition , the Council invited Member States to cooperate in that regard , with a view to encouraging progressive alignment regarding , inter alia , international cooperation , extradition and other bilateral and multilateral modalities of mutual assistance in criminal matters and requested the Secretary-General to report thereon to the Commission at its fifth session .  
Canada has reported that the five major groupings of criminal organizations operating in the country are outlaw motorcycle groups and Aboriginal , Asian , eastern European and Italian organized crime groups , while there is evidence that Colombian drug cartels and the Jamaican " posses " are also active . 
18 If transnational criminal organizations reap considerable benefits from their links with the licit business and financial sectors , they also find it both necessary and advantageous to co-opt public officials , whether to obtain official documents or export licences , to help launder the proceeds of criminal activity or to provide intelligence .  
Such a method of operation may be characterized by widespread use of bribery and favours to ensure the malleability of key positions and agencies ; political funding to ensure that politicians elected to office will be indebted to the criminal organizations ; carefully targeted " payoffs " to law enforcement personnel to provide intelligence ; and the provision of financial incentives to members of the judiciary to ensure that the penalties for criminal activities are either not imposed or are modest .  
The closed nature of ethnic communal groups , enhanced by language barriers and an often imported distrust of the police , make immigrant communities in many countries ideal recruiting and operating grounds for criminal organizations .  
In a confidential assessment completed by the Australian Federal Police , it was noted that Italian organized criminal organizations had penetrated a number of government and non-government agencies and at least one political party and had entrenched themselves in legitimate business to give themselves an air of respectability . 7 Even when they have not achieved this level of penetration , transplanted criminal organizations can still pose formidable challenges to law enforcement , as Chinese organized criminal organizations seem to be doing in South Africa and Russian organized criminal organizations are doing throughout much of Europe . 
48 Argentina has pointed out the merits of common regional strategies and measures against organized transnational crime , while Australia , Canada , Philippines , Republic of Korea and Turkey have drawn attention to the growing number of their bilateral agreements on extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
Cuban legislation has made association with criminal intent an offence and has proscribed as punishable offences those types of behaviour associated with the most common forms of organized transnational crime , but has made no provision for controlled deliveries and electronic surveillance .  
The latter was designed to prevent , investigate and punish violence against women in all its forms , defining the most appropriate criminal laws , procedures and penalties , and spelling out the most practical and concrete national and international action and measures designed to achieve the strategic objectives ( D.l-3 and L . 1-9 ) outlined in the Platform for Action to counter violence against women and the girl child , as priority concerns .  
Governments should be encouraged to make earmarked funds available for specific short-term and long-term activities designed to promote significant progress toward elimination of violence against women through an upgraded and more effective criminal justice system that ensures fair treatment , and that achieves concrete results by means of rigorous needs assessments and evaluations . 
Other representatives stated that the congresses on the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders , the status of which had been modified since they had begun acting as consultative body to the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , should henceforth be better able to respond to the actual needs of Member States , but should nevertheless not fail to set precise objectives and reduce the number of resolutions adopted .  
The rich debate on the results achieved in dealing with the substantive issues on the agenda of the Congress confirmed the leading role of the congresses in the promotion of more effective crime prevention and criminal justice policies and strategies by recommending action at the national , regional and international levels .  
The information received suggests that differences in the judicial traditions , systems and practices of the responding States did not prevent an increased number of countries from including in their domestic legislation , substantial and procedural provisions designed to improve the position of victims in civil , criminal and administrative proceedings .  
The proper functioning of the law enforcement agencies is essential not only to an effective criminal justice policy , but also to the underlying premise of the protection of the fundamental human rights of individuals .  
Behind the trafficking in children were situations involving poverty and abandonment , which often stemmed from social and economic problems of families , such as widespread unemployment ; little State support for large families or for families with little income ; young persons quitting school because of financial problems of their families ; debts of families contracted with usurers or with criminal organizations repaid by illicit work or illicit activities involving minors ; and moral or social degeneration in suburbs .  
For example , in some States , no separate jurisdiction for juveniles exists ; pre-conflict stage resolution is not effectively used ; diversion from criminal justice systems can not be practised because of the absence of adequate alternative programmes ; the administration of juvenile justice is inefficient ; investigation and prosecution procedures are deficient ; placement of juveniles in pre-trial detention is used inappropriately and for too long ; or deprivation of children 's liberty is not used as a last resort but as a general reaction to juvenile delinquency .  
As described in greater detail in the report of the Secretary-General on technical advisory services for the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme ( E / CN . 15 / 1996 / 8 ) , such resources could be used for technical cooperation activities and advisory services geared towards building and supporting democratic institutions and effective criminal justice systems with emphasis on the complementary relationship of justice , peace and development and the need to address them simultaneously .  
The Branch has also issued in response to new legislative enactments , additional reports on the review of priority themes , in accordance with Commission resolution 1 / 1 on strategic management ; action against national and transnational economic and organized crime , and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment ; and capital punishment and implementation of the safeguards guaranteeing the protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty .  
The general orientation of this programme is to promote more effective international cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice by devising strategies to deal with global problems and by assisting Governments in their national and multilateral efforts to respond to changing crime trends , as well as to create the necessary instruments and institutions for a more accountable , transparent and effective crime prevention and control system .  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation thanks the heads of the diplomatic missions and the representatives of international and non-governmental organizations that visited King Khaled University Hospital in order to observe what had taken place , extend their sympathy to the people of Burundi and express their outrage at these criminal acts , which were directed exclusively against defenceless people and the country 's principal medical establishment . 
As stated by a number of members , " it was preferable to designate a specific conduct of States as criminal and to regulate the consequences through judicial review and the introduction of substantive rules to spare the population of the criminal State extreme hardship rather than to leave that whole area unregulated , concealing the punitive element under the guise of restitution or guarantees against repetition .  
The consequences of substance use are diverse , including acute and chronic health problems , disruption to interpersonal relationships ( particularly within families ) , social marginalization , criminal behaviour , school failure , vocational problems and failure to achieve normal adolescent milestones .  
The national law against the illegal smuggling of individuals into the country is embodied in the Immigration and Nationality Act , of which , the section entitled " Bringing in and harbouring certain aliens " , sets out criminal penalties , imprisonment and fines for the crimes of bringing or attempting to bring aliens into the country at other than a port of entry , transporting or harbouring undocumented aliens , and encouraging or inducing an alien to come to the country in violation of its law .  
If there exists substantiated evidence of overt and covert governmental financial influence or otherwise to induce an organization to undertake acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , or substantiated evidence of influence from proceeds resulting from criminal activities , such as the illicit drugs trade , money laundering or the illegal arms trade ; EU proposes :  
Technical advisory services were provided by the Group on a variety of development issues , covering such areas as : inland water transport ; subregional cooperation for lake basin development ; implementation of the African Platform for Action on Women ; formulation of development priorities , programmes and projects ; economic cooperation and integration ; human resources development and utilization , and energy development ; criminal justice and crime prevention ; mineral resources and development ; agricultural development ; rural development ; industrial development ; and science and technology development . 
The information transmitted is often designed to bring about the provisional arrest of a criminal with a view to subsequent extradition .  The organization also has an analytical crime intelligence unit working on international crime and producing reports that are extremely useful in connection with offences such as money-laundering , where transnational movements are very difficult to trace .  
These included : ( a ) the low level of access to the system of administration of justice and , in particular , the failure to respect the right to have interpreters and translators , which would permit indigenous peoples to enjoy on equal terms judicial guarantees in criminal matters ; ( b ) the failure of the State and society at large to provide effective controls and valid measures with respect to human rights violations ; ( c ) poor enforcement of the constitutional and legal guarantees relating to the recognition and enjoyment of their fundamental freedoms .  
Notwithstanding the above , the Government 's compliance with the commitment to supporting and strengthening institutions for the protection of human rights is still highly inadequate , as shown by the absence or weak presence of such institutions in wide areas of the country and the fact that the bodies responsible for implementing this commitment lack a comprehensive policy in criminal matters .  
Ukraine is prepared to cooperate in the effort to combat terrorism , international organized crime , illegal trafficking in narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances , explosives , poisonous substances and radioactive materials , and illegal transborder movements of persons , cargoes , goods and valuables ; in the effort to suppress crimes against persons and government property , and criminal offences in the economic , financial and banking spheres ; and in exchanges of convicted persons .  
Before commencement of the questioning , the suspect shall be informed in detail of the acts of which he is accused , along with all available background information relating to them , a summary of the content of the existing pieces of evidence and the applicable criminal laws .  
International and local observers take the view that principal responsibility for the continuing insecurity lies with the local police , who are either unable or unwilling to take effective action against the ongoing wave of criminal activity against the Croatian Serbs .  
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
A collection of data on the status and implementation of existing multilateral , regional and bilateral agreements relating to international terrorism , including information on incidents caused by international terrorism and criminal prosecutions and sentencing , based on information received from the depositaries of those agreements and from Member States ;  
As to the nature and causes of small arms ' destabilizing accumulation and transfer , in his January 1994 Supplement to an Agenda for Peace , the Secretary-General identified four basic reasons : earlier supply during the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets and criminal activity combined with the collapse of governmental law and order .  
They include financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal liability of the member of the force . 
Recovery may also be sought from States contributing contingents where combat-related damage is caused by members of their national contingent in violation of international humanitarian law and where the international criminal responsibility of the individual member is entailed .  
They include : financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from States contributing contingents for damage caused by gross negligence , wilful misconduct , or which entails the international criminal responsibility of the individual member of the Force .  
The Special Rapporteur has maintained and continues to maintain that mercenaries exist ; that they are not a small number of individuals ; that they are groups of professionals selling their skill in war and violence ; that they are also criminal organizations , an international blight in their perpetration of acts of violence which ruin human lives , create material losses , hamper economic activity and extend to terrorist attacks that have touched off or aggravated conflicts , with often catastrophic results for the peoples affected by them . 
Consequently , in his previous report to the General Assembly ( A / 50 / 390 , para . 28 ) , the Special Rapporteur indicated that illicit activities in which nationality is used to mask their mercenary nature by a Power that recruits , prepares and pays an individual to perpetrate a criminal act against another country , its Government , its property or a given sector of its population should be analysed and debated with a view to revising current international provisions on the subject .  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
The Secretary-General concluded that , given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , was crucial , and measures needed to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
At its fifth session , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice adopted resolution 5 / 2 , entitled " Technical cooperation and interregional advisory services in crime prevention and criminal justice " , in which it reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services as a means for the Programme to respond to the needs of the international community in the face of both national and transnational criminality , as well as the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme .  
Despite the interest expressed in these projects , inter alia , by the countries where these peacekeeping missions are carried out , subsequent project proposals related to training needs of the civilian police of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium ( UNTAES ) , the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina ( UNMIBH ) and the local police forces , including the establishment of a focal point for strengthening of criminal justice institutions , have so far received little support .  
Especially fruitful cooperation was established with the Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation , which funded and organized the printing and dissemination of additional copies of the Compendium of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice in French , as well as the translation into French of the Basic Training Manual for Correctional Workers , and provided financial support also for the implementation of a comprehensive project in assistance to the criminal justice system for Burkina Faso , which was undertaken in March 1996 .  
The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , at its fifth session , held from 21 to 31 May 1996 , was informed of the Institute 's efforts to promote regional technical cooperation and to coordinate activities in crime prevention , thus aiming at the promotion of sustainable development and respect for the rule of law by making criminal justice systems more effective in Africa .  
The Institute was encouraged by an increased willingness of African States to base their policy decisions with regard to crime prevention and criminal justice issues on appropriate , adequate , valid and reliable data , as has been indicated by several participants of training activities organized by the Institute . The Institute will continue to undertake advisory missions and train national officials towards establishing appropriate structures and systems for the regular production of the required crime data .  
Considering the priority that African Governments are giving to achieve economic growth and sustainable development , considering also the challenge of growing criminality , both national and transnational , it is imperative that all measures that are being taken to achieve sustainable development are linked with crime prevention and criminal justice .  
Second , it accepted the principle that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes were in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that might be invoked to justify them . 
Often linked to other criminal activities such as the illegal arms trade , drug trafficking and money laundering , terrorism knew no boundaries , and no one State was safe against it ; effective and concerted international cooperation was therefore essential . 
These measures are : ( a ) the establishment of a permanent international criminal court with universal jurisdiction over mass violations of human rights and humanitarian law ; such an international criminal court would have to be bestowed with an adequate mandate and sufficient means to enable it to conduct thorough investigations and enforce the implementation of its decisions ; and ( b ) the adoption of a convention , similar to the Convention against Torture , which would provide domestic courts with international jurisdiction over persons suspected of having committed mass violations of the right to life .  
In addition , Tunisia 's penal system is sufficiently well developed from the standpoint of criminal legislation and juridical institutions to ensure the punishment of any use of scientific progress for purposes prejudicial to human life or individual freedom or privacy .  
In paragraphs 38 to 44 of his report , the Secretary-General discusses several means of limiting the liability of the Organization , such as financial and temporal limitation , counter-claims and off-sets , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal responsibility on the part of a member of the force .  
A renewed commitment by all involved in organized society , political parties , religious groups , communal groups , law enforcement agencies , to eschew resort to criminal violence in pursuit of their objectives needs to be declared and implemented .  
In a memorandum dated 11 April 1996 addressed to the Assistant Secretary-General for Planning and Support , Department of Peacekeeping Operations , and a similar memorandum dated 25 July 1996 to the Officer-in-Charge of the Procurement and Transportation Division and to all executive officers at Headquarters , chiefs of administration at offices away from Headquarters and international criminal tribunals , the Assistant Secretary-General for Conference and Support Services has established strict procedures in processing ex post facto and partial ex post facto cases .  
The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers expresses grave concern that in Nigeria today substantial judicial power , particularly in the administration of criminal justice , is vested in the military and special ad hoc tribunals to the exclusion of the ordinary courts . 
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money-laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
On the question of limitations of liability ( para . 38 ) , given the substantial increase in the number and amount of third-party claims against the United Nations , the General Assembly might wish to consider , inter alia , financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal liability of the member of the force .  
It is pertinent to note that during the period under review , the secretariat of the AALCC organized , within the framework of the Consultative Committee at its thirty-fifth session , held in March 1996 in Manila , a special meeting on the proposed establishment of an international criminal court , which furnished a forum for an exchange of views on the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission on that proposed international criminal court . 
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
In the light of events in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , serious thought should be given to the current state and future direction of the development of the criminal aspects of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
Mr . ECONOMIDES ( Greece ) said that , from the legal standpoint , one could question the wisdom of establishing a dual regime whereby crimes of aggression - far and away the most serious crime in relations between States - would be tried by an international criminal court , while the other four crimes included in the draft Code would be subject to the concurrent jurisdiction of national courts and an international criminal court .  
The Contracting States shall ensure that their national laws recognize that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are under any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them .  
Portugal 's domestic legislation provided for the criminal responsibility of legal persons , including that of the State , and there were merits in developing the concept of international criminal responsibility , but the draft articles did not include specific consequences attached to a crime as opposed to a mere wrongful act .  
Noting that the Preparatory Committee continued the discussion of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute and initiated consideration of draft texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court ,  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
Efforts should continue for the establishment of an international criminal court to combat the impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators of the most serious crimes against humanity , the worst war criminals and the worst violators of human rights , who went unpunished as a result of defunct or seriously flawed judicial systems and pro domo amnesty laws .  
Under article R . 645 _ 1 of the Penal Code , a fine of up to 10,000 francs is imposed for publicly wearing a uniform or displaying insignia or emblems resembling those worn by the members of an organization declared criminal by the N \ x { e16c } nberg Tribunal ( SS , Gestapo , SD and Nazi Commander Corps ) or by any person found guilty of crimes against humanity .  
The departmental coordination unit to combat racism , xenophobia and antisemitism , set up within each departmental council for the prevention of delinquency under the circular issued by the Prime Minister to the prefects on 1 March 1993 , meets at least once a year to monitor problems of racism , initiate warning procedures , if necessary , collect information on local criminal policy , promote the amicable settlement of disputes and , in the light of particular local characteristics , propose measures to strengthen social cohesiveness . 
On 16 March 1994 , he was charged by the Poitiers correctional court with carrying a prohibited weapon and wearing the uniform of an organization declared to be criminal and sentenced to a four _ month suspended sentence and 200 hours of public service over a period of 18 months , together with a 4,000 franc fine and the confiscation of the uniform and the weapon ( No . 93-29 ) .  
Whether legislation ( criminal and / or family law ) includes a prohibition of all forms of physical and mental violence , including corporal punishment , deliberate humiliation , injury , abuse , neglect or exploitation , inter alia within the family , in foster and other forms of care , and in public or private institutions , such as penal institutions and schools ;  
" Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .

Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;

Others had felt that certain kinds of environmental damage , such as damage caused by the deliberate detonation of nuclear explosions or pollution of entire rivers , should entail the individual criminal responsibility of those responsible , particularly since the fate of future generations was at stake .  
The concept of an international crime , which was not strictly identical to the notion of criminal responsibility in national law , indicated clearly that the violation of the legal and moral obligations essential to the peace , survival and prosperity of the international community was considered to be on a par with the most serious criminal offences punishable under national law .  
Given that the rules they set forth were complementary , and that States parties to the Code would , ipso facto , be called upon to recognize the existence of an international criminal court , her delegation considered that the Commission should concentrate on drafting two harmonious and complementary texts of equal legal value , whether separate or incorporated .  
The practical difficulties in proving racial motivation beyond reasonable doubt , the adequacy of existing arrangements whereby the activities of extremist or racist organizations had been dealt with under existing criminal laws , and the general power of the courts to take racial motivation into account as an aggravating feature within existing maximum penalties were also addressed .  
However , the easy availability of weapons , the high incidence of armed criminal activity and the fact that the first police officers graduated only 18 months ago are clear indications that the HNP faces formidable challenges in its efforts to maintain a secure and stable environment .  
Belgium is in favour of the adoption of a binding instrument which , supplementing the Convention on the Rights of the Child , would have the effect of compelling the signatory States to rank practices linked to the sexual exploitation of children as penal offences , so that they can be punished under criminal law .  
\ x { f448 } RK ( Slovenia ) said that the Code of crimes against the peace and security of mankind would complement the functioning of the future international criminal court and also serve domestic legal systems by unifying the criminal law and practice concerning the crimes which were considered to be the most serious crimes under international law .  
The Secretariat could prepare draft final articles that established a procedure for revision of the future Code , defined the relationship between the latter , the draft statute of the international criminal court and international conventions or treaties , and prohibited the formulation of reservations with a view to ensuring the universality and integrity of the Code .  
In that connection , bearing in mind that the draft Code and the international criminal court would form part of a single international legal regime , he hoped that the court 's statute would provide more specific guidance on issues which were not clearly defined in , or omitted from , the draft Code .  
Moreover , and this point has been stressed by several speakers today , the experience of the Tribunal for Rwanda , like the experience of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia , is to be considered as one of the key elements for the future establishment of a permanent international criminal court , a project that is well under way and for which Italy has offered to host , in 1998 , a diplomatic conference to adopt a statute for such a court .  
The main difficulty in controlling illicit drugs was that well-organized , well-financed and closely-knit criminal cartels had flexible mechanisms , were capable of threatening entire States and did not hesitate to corrupt officials in order to reach their goals .  
Concerning the procedural aspects of the question , it had become clear that the establishment of a permanent international criminal court posed difficult political and technical problems .  
To that end , the court should be based on optional jurisdiction , its jurisdiction should cover only the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole , it should ensure respect for and primacy of national criminal justice systems , it should be an independent international juridical institution , and accused persons should be accorded all relevant individual human rights and commonly recognized procedural guarantees .  
Ukraine had always supported the creation of an international criminal court and was ready to participate actively in the future work , in the hope that the international community would demonstrate enough political will to meet what was an historic challenge .  
His delegation had actively participated in every aspect of the work , as the United States was committed to the establishment of a fair , effective and truly international criminal court that met all relevant standards of due process and strengthened both international and national law enforcement and military justice interests .  
In order to prevent or minimize unnecessary jurisdictional conflicts between the international criminal court and national courts , the future convention should delineate clearly their respective jurisdictions .  
The General Assembly in 1994 created an ad hoc committee to consider the establishment of a permanent international criminal court , based upon a report and draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission . 23 The Assembly has since established a preparatory committee to prepare a draft convention for such a court that could be considered at an international conference of plenipotentiaries . 24 This momentum must not be lost . 
The establishment of an international criminal court would be a monumental advance , affording , at last , genuine international jurisdictional protection to some of the world 's major legal achievements . 
The members of the Sub-Committee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
At the same time , States are moving towards establishing the individual penal responsibility of those who commit extremely grave international crimes , through the creation of special courts and the forthcoming establishment of an international criminal court .  
Noting that the Preparatory Committee continued the discussion of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute and initiated consideration of draft texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court ,  
Such educational material which may necessarily involve detailed information about transmission risks and may be targeted to groups engaging in illegal behaviour , such as injecting drug use and homosexual behaviour , where applicable , should not be wrongfully subject to censorship or obscenity laws or laws making those imparting the information liable for aiding and abetting criminal offences .  
There have been no major criminal trials or detentions for lengthy periods , but the deprivation of liberty of leaders and activists of opposing political parties has continued , for brief periods of a few days , often accompanied by physical ill _ treatment , threats and the imposition of fines as a means of intimidating them into giving up political activities .  
Also in relation to the clause mentioned in paragraph 20 , the National Reconciliation Act shall extinguish criminal liability for related common crimes committed in the armed conflict , such crimes being defined as those which are directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to the commission of the political crimes referred to in the preceding paragraph and which can not be shown to be motivated by personal goals .  
In respect of persons who were involved in the internal armed conflict owing to institutional mandates , the National Reconciliation Act shall contain specific provisions equivalent to those previously mentioned , in that they shall extinguish criminal liability for common crimes perpetrated with the aim of preventing , thwarting , suppressing or punishing the commission of political crimes and related common crimes , where such crimes were directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to that aim , unless it is demonstrated that there is no relationship between the criminal act and the stated aim .  
The case has some special features , not only because of its innately tragic nature , but because of its more immediate effects ; for the first time a President of the Republic accepted institutional responsibility for an occurrence ; for the first time a massacre was immediately brought before the courts ; for the first time a whole military unit was taken to court ; for the first time military jurisdiction was set supplanted by the civil courts in a case with military defendants ; for the first time criminal charges of extrajudicial execution were preferred .  
Given this appalling situation , we urge the international community , as represented by its specialized organizations and institutions and first and foremost by the Security Council , the International Committee of the Red Cross , the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the States signatories to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 , to discharge their humanitarian responsibilities and obligations by condemning these most heinous violations committed by the criminal Ethiopian Tigray forces against the civilians and soldiers who have fallen victim to the brutal aggression launched on our eastern borders .  
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
The growing international concern at such problems as freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention , protection against all forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , circumstances and conditions of detention and imprisonment , and humanization of criminal justice were cornerstones of the protection of human rights .  
In its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission again requested the Secretary-General to continue to strengthen the cooperation with UNDCP , including the undertaking of joint initiatives , and called upon the Department for Development Support and Management Services and the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat , UNDP , the World Bank and international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice , utilizing the expertise of the Programme .  
Member States are also urged to rely on the existing United Nations model treaties on extradition , mutual assistance in criminal matters , transfer of proceedings and transfer of prisoners , as necessary , as useful tools in improving international cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of cases of illicit trafficking in motor vehicles ;  
The characteristics of those criminal groups , which closely resemble those of groups operating in other countries , their hierarchical structure , internal code of conduct , resources available and ability to penetrate the market , make local organized crime a highly dangerous feature for the newly established social and economic setting of Belarus .  
The main conclusions of the seminar were that relevant international organizations should provide their assistance to countries in need , while the latter should make every possible effort to ratify existing relevant international instruments and to elaborate new ones aimed at combating organized transnational crime .  8 .  Bosnia and Herzegovina indicated that its criminal legislation contained provisions that would allow it to deal with criminal acts carried out by organized crime groups .  
In particular , the country had witnessed during the war forms of crimes that , given their sophistication and the means employed , were classified as organized criminal activities , in particular illicit trafficking in stolen cars , passing of counterfeit banknotes , mostly United States dollars and deutsche mark , and suspicious financial transactions that were considered to cover up money - laundering schemes .  
Owing to the cross-border character of those criminal activities , Bosnia and Herzegovina recognized the importance of and was ready for cooperation with other members of the international community in fighting organized crime , starting with the regional level , where the Government was preparing a draft agreement to be signed with a neighbouring country on mutual assistance and collaboration in preventing and controlling organized crime , illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and terrorism .  
At the international level , over the last decade , a number of treaties , agreements and other instruments on mutual assistance in criminal matters had been signed with several countries of various regions , in addition to an agreement with the European Union ( EU ) on precursors and chemical substances used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs .  
The Estonian criminal code considered as organized crime groups those criminal associations composed of three or more members who , on a constant basis and with identified functions , committed serious criminal offences ; using that definition , the Estonian authorities reported that in the last decade more than 10 criminal associations had been identified in the country , 8 of them operating permanently since their formation in the mid-1980s .  
Greece indicated that although no legal provisions had been enacted that dealt with organized transnational crime in particular , its law enforcement agencies were operating against organized crime and making use of criminal legislation designed to tackle illicit drug trafficking , crimes related to firearms , money-laundering , trafficking in illegal migrants and other offences typically committed by organized crime groups , and that a number of characteristics of organized crime had been identified within the framework of EU and were being applied by national authorities to classify an illegal action as a form of organized crime .  
Particularly relevant was the legislation enacted to control money-laundering and criminal assets in general , which included a broad number of criminal activities whose revenues were to be disguised through money-laundering schemes , the reversal of the onus probandi as to the source of the assets for those who were sentenced for one of the crimes covered by the law and the obligation for financial institutions to report any suspect transaction to the competent authorities .  
Those measures included the establishment of a national standing committee composed of law enforcement officers and academic experts charged with undertaking research on various forms of crime usually carried out by criminal organizations and of a department of public security specialized in organized crime , as well as the development of specialized training programmes for law enforcement personnel and public awareness campaigns to sensitize the Saudi public to the dangers posed by organized crime .  
The Slovak authorities , concerned that illicit drug trafficking , terrorism , arms trafficking , fraud , money-laundering and other criminal activities being carried out by criminal groups with international connections might have a negative impact on the still relatively young national institutions and society in general , had taken steps to strengthen the law enforcement capacity of the national agencies , to create a better understanding among the population of the risks posed by organized crime and to reinforce international cooperation with a view to fighting internationally operating criminal groups .  
Major criminal activities in which organized transnational crime was engaged were violent behaviour and the use of bribery , graft and extortion that could lead to the subversion of the political , social and economic infrastructure , drug trafficking , terrorist activities , kidnapping , prostitution , counterfeiting of currencies , manipulation of financial institutions and markets , international money-laundering and financial fraud , arms smuggling , alien smuggling and computer crime .  
The participants expressed deep concern at the aggravation of the situation of organized transnational crime , including illicit drug trafficking , corruption and money-laundering , experienced throughout the region and emphasized the threat posed by those forms of criminal activity to government structures and democratic institutions and to the population in general .  
The importance of controlling the spread of organized crime in the region and enabling the national criminal justice systems to deal with the threat was also recognized by the development of a project that would encompass two training seminars in the application of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , with a focus on extradition and organized transnational crime , for judges , prosecutors and police officers from west African States .  
Their main objectives include assistance in drafting and implementing up-to-date legislation in the field of preventing and controlling organized transnational crime and associated criminal activities ; assistance to selected government departments in meeting problems raised by the legal reform process through training and the provision of short-term expertise ; and strengthening of the criminal justice system capacity to fight organized crime , also in cooperation with international counterparts .  
CIS countries had realized the serious threat posed to their social , political and economic systems by criminal aggression and they were developing defensive measures , which included law enforcement cooperation , harmonization of existing criminal laws and drafting of new legislation , and multilateral treaties .  
The follow-up to the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan has generated both a focused discussion on the issue of organized transnational crime , as well as a wealth of information that would need systematization and analysis to be transformed into practical tools , in particular model legislation , training for law enforcement and advisory assistance for the reform of the criminal justice system .  
It has also become clear that the problems created for countries by organized transnational crime may be solved only through the adoption and implementation of measures that could comprise up-to-date legislation to deal with this criminal phenomenon ; increased capacity of criminal justice systems to enforce existing legislation and control organized transnational crime ; strengthened ability to gather and analyse reliable information on organized crime activities , with a view to devising preventive and control policies ; and more effective inter-state cooperation when investigating , prosecuting or judging organized transnational crime offences .  
On the basis of a set of background documents and a compendium of summarized project proposals the informal consultative group stressed the importance of crime prevention and criminal justice in development , analysed the role of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme , its comparative advantages and potential , and recommended specific modalities of resource mobilization , after having reviewed national policies and practices relating to development-assistance funding .  
More generally , it was agreed that the uniform rules to be prepared should not attempt to deal with any of the issues of national security , public policy , criminal or administrative law that might become involved in the implementation of digital signature schemes .  
Mindful that no one should be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , that such actions constitute a criminal attempt to destroy a fellow human being physically and mentally , which can never be justified under any circumstances , by any ideology or by any overriding interest , and convinced that a society that tolerates torture can never claim to respect human rights ,  
D . 1 .  * This compilation of information concerning criminal acts committed by the separatists is based on the evidence of 15,000 witnesses and innocent victims of those acts , as also on a large amount of photographic and video material gathered by the Prosecutor 's Office of Georgia in the process of the investigation and contained in more than 100 volumes .  
In the absence of a ratification making it possible to apply a universal jurisdiction clause to the country where the crime was committed , States may for efficiency 's sake take measures in their internal legislation to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction over serious crimes under international law committed outside their territory which by their nature are within the purview not only of internal criminal law but also of an international punitive system to which the concept of frontiers is alien .  
All victims shall have access to a readily available , prompt and effective remedy in the form of criminal , civil , administrative or disciplinary proceedings covered by the restrictions on prescription set out in principle 29 .  
Not many reports have furnished sufficient information concerning such relevant matters as the minimum age at which a juvenile may be charged with a criminal offence , the maximum age at which a person is still considered to be a juvenile , the existence of special courts and procedures , the laws governing procedures against juveniles and how all these special arrangements for juveniles take account of " the desirability of promoting their rehabilitation " .  
On the basis of information received by Member States , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice is in a position to consider " devising an effective approach that criminal justice systems might adopt to combat the illegal smuggling of migrants , for example , taking more compatible and better harmonized countermeasures , in terms of policy and practical operations , at the national , regional and international levels " ( E / CN . 15 / 1997 / 8 , para .  44 ) .  
These populations , sometimes held hostage by armed groups bent on genocide for which an international criminal court has been set up have in turn been massacred in circumstances that need to be brought to light so that a different future can be forged .  
Whereas during the armed rebellion and aggression against Croatia many criminal acts , grave breaches of international humanitarian law and of the basic rights of the individual were committed ,  
The Special Representative notes that in the past , senior officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran have attempted to distinguish between the act of private worship , which is permitted , and more public acts such as teaching , forming assemblies and working with the administration of the Baha'i community , which were forbidden on the grounds that those were hostile and conspiratorial acts that were criminal in nature .  
The visits to Kibungo Prison and the communal cachots and the discussions with the civilian , military , prison and judicial officials who met with the Special Representative provided valuable insight into the prevailing conditions of detention and the urgency of conducting fair and effective criminal trials for those accused of genocide and related acts .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing and spreading violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are essential to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
The court should be impartial and independent , complementary to national criminal justice systems but not subordinate to them or to any national or international political body .  
While the idea of an international criminal court had been on the international agenda for centuries , the past few years had seen promising developments , arousing more enthusiasm for the process than ever before , as evidenced by the constant increase in the number of countries favouring the early establishment of such a court .  That increase was encouraging , as was the growing public awareness of the need for perpetrators of heinous crimes to be brought to justice .  
It was imperative that the international criminal court should be an organ that was universally accepted by all the principal legal systems as well as all the major geographical regions of the world so as to ensure its effectiveness and authority .  
The discussions of the Commission had focused on issues of priority concern to Member States , such as enhancing the rule of law and fighting corruption , development of the criminal justice system , implementation of the United Nations Declaration on Crime and Public Security , regulation of firearms , promotion of international cooperation against transnational crime , extradition , cooperation in criminal matters , the smuggling of illegal migrants , illicit trafficking in motor vehicles and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Activities in this field have included conducting and coordinating trial monitoring activities ; providing human rights expertise to the expert team for criminal justice reform ; supporting a project on a judicial training institute ; and conducting a project to provide suspects with lawyers familiar with international human rights law .  
This is a test of our collective responsibility , made even more pressing by the terrible massacres that have characterized recent ethnic conflicts , and Italy confirms its strong support , pledges its active contribution to this endeavour , and is prepared to host in Rome the diplomatic conference to adopt the statute for the international criminal court . 
Over the last six months , we have used this peace-building fund for the following purposes : to provide critical start-up funding for the historical clarification Commission in Guatemala ; to assist the preparatory commission for the establishment of an international criminal court by underwriting the participation of delegates from developing countries ; and to provide financial assistance for the work of the joint United Nations / Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) Special Representative for the Great Lakes region of Africa , Mr . Mohamed Sahnoun .  
Furthermore , in accordance with the collective will of the people of the Sudan , a presidential decree granted an unconditional general amnesty in respect of all crimes committed and all civil and criminal claims asserted during the 14 years preceding the signing of the agreement .  
Last year , the Assembly demonstrated the widespread and growing international support for a permanent international criminal court when it unanimously adopted resolution 51 / 207 , which set mid-1998 as the date for a diplomatic conference to finalize and adopt a convention on the establishment of such a court .  
The experience gained from the functioning of these two ad hoc tribunals has paved the way for the wider acceptance of the idea of an international criminal court , thus creating a firm legal basis at the universal level for the establishment of individual criminal responsibility with regard to war crimes and crimes against humanity .  
Transnational criminal organizations have , in fact , existed for a long time , but the globalization of international relations with regard to the economy , commerce , telecommunications and the rapid progress of technology , as well as the disappearance of ideological blocs , have permitted the activities of transnational criminal organizations to expand and have increased their power to such an extent that they are now a permanent threat to the foundation and internal security of States , to their cultural and artistic heritage and to the environment of the planet .  
We share the basic premise that we live in a world of contradictions : integration and globalization coexist with fragmentation and marginalization ; computer science , while a source of progress , is also facilitating the expansion of transnational criminal networks , drug trafficking , money laundering and terrorism ; greater awareness of environmental problems is not accompanied by the political will to find satisfactory solutions ; and despite the strengthening of democracy , extremely serious violations of human rights continue to be committed .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
The legal system of every State shall provide for prompt and effective disciplinary , administrative , civil and criminal procedures so as to ensure readily accessible and adequate redress , and protection from intimidation and retaliation .  
Despite promises by senior officials that they would furnish to the Special Rapporteur evidence that the State addressed cases of abuse of power and unlawful conduct on the part of its officials , he never received any proof of a single investigation or administrative or criminal proceeding against an official responsible for abuse of power or any other offence .  
Without prejudice to the foregoing , it is essential that the authorities should put an immediate end to all acts of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and impose criminal and disciplinary penalties on those responsible .  
The special courts , such as the one in Kibungo , have begun operating , like the ordinary courts , which had already been functioning for several months and trying ordinary civil and criminal cases , including current violations of human rights .  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
In view of its coordinating role , the Commission called upon the Department for Development Support and Management Services of the Secretariat , the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat , the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice , also as part of current programmes in the field of good governance and institution-building , utilizing the expertise of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 51 / 63 , reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and stressed the need to continue to improve the operational activities of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States , at their request , for support in crime prevention and criminal justice .  
In this connection , the Mission underscored the importance of excluding from the extinction of liability those human rights violations which had occurred outside the strict framework of the internal armed conflict , and the major responsibility of the judicial authorities for complying with the spirit of the law by disallowing an extinction of criminal liability for those crimes which , under domestic law or the international treaties ratified by Guatemala , are imprescriptible or are not subject to such an extinction .  
The reply further pointed out that labour rehabilitation is a compulsory re-education and reform measure taken to prevent and reduce crime and safeguard the social order , and by its nature is not a criminal punishment , and that it applies to urban persons whose habitual anti-social behaviour is incorrigible by other means or whose delinquency , though not so serious as to be deemed criminal , yet clearly transgresses against statutory interdictions and therefore qualified for rehabilitation .  
In addition , legal officers assigned to the investigation teams , with one exception , had little or no experience in criminal investigations ; yet they were charged with the task of advising the investigators on how to proceed to collect sufficient evidence , as well as drafting and defending the indictments .  This process has been corrected by the current Prosecutor .  
On behalf of the Society for the Reform of Criminal Law , the Centre was responsible for the organization of an international conference on the theme " Challenges to criminal justice in a changing world " , which took place at Whistler , British Columbia , from 21 to 24 August 1996 , and examined the challenges posed by increasing opportunities in organized economic crime .  
In the same resolution , the Council recognized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in the enforcement of domestic and international environmental criminal laws , of promoting operational activities in that area , and of protecting the environment not only at the national level but also at the international level .  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States in order to determine the feasibility of establishing appropriate machinery for applying criminal law for the protection of the environment , and to establish and maintain close cooperation with Member States and other bodies active in the field of environmental protection , particularly in the area of technical cooperation and assistance , and to continue gathering information on national environmental criminal law and regional and multinational initiatives .  
Israeli environmental legislation consists of national and municipal legislation as well as international law , and is enforced through administrative , civil and criminal measures .  
In this respect , the ultimate objective of the Ministry of the Environment is to develop , in cooperation with the Ministry of Justice and Law and other competent authorities of the judicial sector , a theoretical and practical support structure , allowing for a policy against environmental crime to be developed , in order to enhance the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment and , at the same time , to strengthen administrative measures .  
Israel reported that at the criminal supervisory level , a well-equipped and highly mobile " environmental patrol " , staffed by trained personnel authorized with police officers ' powers , operated within the Ministry of the Environment .  
While it was true that any enforcement of environmental administrative law was to some extent dependent on a general understanding that non-compliance with legal rules will not be tolerated , criminal law should only be applied as an ultima ratio , and should be restricted to the most severe cases of environmental damage .  
In addition to the general problems involved with an international criminal court , the material differences in the environmental law of different countries made the international hearing of environmental cases difficult , particularly with regard to the choice of law .  
The Lusaka Agreement is a cooperative regional arrangement to combat illegal trade in wild fauna and flora , aimed at reducing but ultimately eliminating illegal trade in wildlife species by establishing bodies to ensure effective criminal enforcement mechanisms of environmental law at both the national and regional level .  
At the regional level , it establishes a permanent multinational task force , composed of national law enforcement officers from each party capable of operating across the borders to combat criminal activities committed in the illegal trade in wildlife .  
The combined publication will identify areas where concrete projects in the field of criminal enforcement of environmental law could be developed and implemented , and proposes elements on which technical assistance activities may be focused , such as the preparation of legislation , institution-building , enforcement tools , training and education .  
However , to combat crimes involving , in particular , illegal trafficking in hazardous and nuclear substances and endangered species , criminal law should be used as the primary tool , since penal sanctions , by criminalizing a certain behaviour with a corresponding penalty , have a greater deterrent effect .  
On the basis of both kinds of information , the Commission might then consider devising an effective approach that criminal justice systems might adopt to combat the illegal smuggling of migrants , for example , taking more compatible and better harmonized countermeasures , in terms of policy and in practical operations , at the national , regional and international levels .  
States could also usefully rely on the existing United Nations model treaties on extradition , mutual assistance in criminal matters , transfer of proceedings and transfer of prisoners , as necessary , as tools in improving international cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of cases of illicit trafficking in motor vehicles .  
The Division will analyse and develop as required policy issues in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and produce major reports and documents such as United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems , the global report on crime and justice and the international study on firearm regulation , as well as analytical reports of the Secretary-General on the thematic issues before the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and on emerging trends and new approaches to issues affecting the situation in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
Therefore , programmes composed of interrelated and carefully coordinated measures , including administrative , civil , procedural and criminal legislation , as well as various regulatory provisions and administrative action designed to prevent and control corruption , are of high priority .  
Mindful that no one should be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , that such actions constitute a criminal attempt to destroy a fellow human being physically and mentally , which can never be justified under any circumstances , by any ideology or by any overriding interest , and convinced that a society that tolerates torture can never claim to respect human rights ,  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
The members of the Subcommittee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
That strategy was already yielding results : between 1992 and 1996 , per capita income had risen substantially , while rural poverty had declined ; direct elections to new village committees had been held in the majority of municipalities , provinces and autonomous regions and the revised criminal code had established , inter alia , the principle of equality before the law .  
Jordan also supported resolution 51 / 210 , in which the General Assembly had renewed its affirmation that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes were in any circumstance unjustifiable .  
The sponsors and executive entities of , and the research teams involved in , the above-mentioned surveys agreed that there was a need for more coordination and complementarity in applying the experiences and the results of the surveys , in order to enhance the understanding of crime and criminal justice processes at the international as well as at the national and local levels .  
Canada pointed out that , while the idea of an " omnibus convention " on organized transnational crime was an attractive proposition that might have the effect of sending a strong public signal that the international community would not accept criminal abuse of the very positive global trend to loosen international boundaries , it had concerns about that proposal , particularly as far as the possible duplication with other legal instruments and cooperative mechanisms was concerned , at least until the issue of whether such a convention was intended to supersede or supplement existing instruments was clarified .  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
Declaring gross and massive violations of human rights perpetrated on the orders of a Government or with its sanction to be international crimes will establish a firm basis in international law for addressing , first , the grave international legal responsibility of the State on behalf of which a Government acts and , second , the question of the criminal responsibility of officials perpetrating such violations .  
By my letter dated 1 November 1996 ( S / 1996 / 910 ) , I transmitted to your predecessor the letter dated 23 October 1996 in which the Government of Burundi formally proposed that the Security Council set up an international criminal tribunal to punish the crimes of genocide perpetrated in Burundi and requested direct proof and circumstantial evidence from the International Commission of Inquiry concerning the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye , which was " planned beforehand " , and concerning acts of genocide .  
Despite the difficulties that some developing countries had had in expressing their views on the topic , a consensus seemed to be emerging that a permanent , universally accepted and independent court should be established by means of an international treaty , that the court should have jurisdiction over the most serious crimes , and that the principles of criminal law and procedural aspects must be incorporated in the statute .  
An appropriate balance must also be struck between including all the substantive and procedural norms necessary to ensure proper criminal procedure and the need to avoid an excessive level of detail which could impede the success of the initiative .  
Particular attention should be paid to protecting the rights of children deprived of their liberty , to raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility and to improving the quality and adequacy of alternative measures to imprisonment .  
Specifically , the Committee is concerned about the very young age of criminal responsibility ( 7 years ) , the lack of adequate protection for children aged 16 _ 18 , grounds for arrest and detention of children that can include prostitution , vagrancy or uncontrollable behaviour , the possibility of imposing heavy sentences on children and the solitary confinement and ill _ treatment of children by the police .  
With regard to the administration of juvenile justice , the Committee recommends that legal reform be pursued in connection with the very young age of criminal responsibility ( 7 years ) , the lack of adequate protection for children aged 16 _ 18 , grounds for arrest and detention of children that can include prostitution , vagrancy or uncontrollable behaviour , the possibility of imposing heavy sentences on children , and the solitary confinement and ill _ treatment of children by the police .  
The High Contracting Parties shall cooperate in combating crime , especially organized crime , terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , including criminal acts directed against the safety of maritime navigation , civil aviation and other forms of transport , illegal trafficking in radioactive materials , weapons , narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and contraband , including the illegal transfer across the border of objects of cultural , historical or artistic value .  
In the case of illicit transfers , which often rely on criminal organizations , countries should focus on improved national legislative measures and their effective implementation , and on improving international cooperation and coordination to prevent illegal transfers , including customs and police cooperation .  
Against the backdrop of the end of the cold war and the diminished possibility of global nuclear confrontation , the Board discussed the security consequences of economic globalization , the lessening of the importance of national boundaries and the increase in intra-State conflict and illicit trafficking in small arms and other criminal activities .  
The borderlines between political and criminal violence become blurred as precious time is lost in waiting for the overall settlement of long-standing issues which become more entangled as the search continues for a lasting resolution of problems firmly entrenched in history .  
For that purpose , we intend to develop programmes composed of interrelated and carefully coordinated measures , including administrative , civil , procedural and criminal legislation , as well as various regulatory provisions and administrative action designed to prevent and control corruption and bribery , as a matter of high priority .  
In his opening address , the Prime Minister of Senegal expressed the hope that the Regional Ministerial Workshop would focus on strengthening international cooperation in technical and substantive fields , in order to improve the professional skills of criminal justice personnel and thereby enable them to achieve greater success in the fight against organized transnational crime and corruption .  
It was also recommended that the indicative list of criminal activities contained in article 1 of the draft framework convention should be supplemented with the following crimes : trafficking in illegal migrants ; extortion ; kidnapping ; cattle-rustling ; export of toxic wastes ; illicit export of precious raw materials ; trafficking in protected species ; international fraud ; sexual exploitation of children ; trafficking in human organs ; and violation of intellectual property rights .  
In the light of these facts , the Government of Cuba issued a denunciation , through the diplomatic channel , with a view to alerting the international community and international public opinion to what it considered to be a new campaign , developed in complete silence and complicity and aimed at tightening even further the iron-clad and criminal economic , commercial and blockade which the United States has maintained against Cuba for 37 years . 
Invites the regional commissions , the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network , government-appointed national correspondents in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice , specialized agencies and other entities within the United Nations system , the intergovernmental organizations concerned and relevant non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council to become actively involved in the preparations for the Tenth Congress ;  
In the absence of ratification making it possible to apply a universal jurisdiction clause to the country where a violation was committed , States may take practical measures in their domestic legislation to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction over serious crimes under international law committed outside their territory , which by their nature fall within the scope not only of domestic criminal law but also of an international punitive system which disregards the concept of frontiers .  
All victims shall have access to a readily available , prompt and effective remedy in the form of criminal , civil , administrative or disciplinary proceedings subject to the restrictions on prescription set out in principle 24 .  
While the Government of Croatia has publicly stated that it no longer possesses a " war crimes list " of persons in the region whose alleged criminal acts fall outside the Amnesty Law , this statement falls short of the obligation to reduce public anxieties by concluding investigations of alleged serious crimes against international humanitarian law with the participation of the United Nations and local Serbs . 
The Special Rapporteur reiterates his solemn and urgent appeal to the Burundian authorities to defer the 38 death sentences and 19 sentences of life imprisonment handed down during the February-March , April-May and July-August sessions of the criminal chambers , as well as the previous 133 death sentences and 54 sentences of life imprisonment , at least until the peace negotiations have been completed and a reformed judicial system , capable of playing its role with complete independence and impartiality , has been established .  
Accordingly , the level of proof the Panel has considered appropriate is close to what has been called the balance of probability as distinguished from the concept of beyond reasonable doubt required in some jurisdictions to prove guilt in a criminal trial .  
His delegation looked forward to the next session of the Preparatory Committee with a view to moving closer to realizing the final objective of establishing a permanent , functional and credible international criminal court .  
Further attention was drawn to the need to establish arrangements for special investigative techniques , such as electronic surveillance , undercover operations and controlled deliveries , as practical tools to penetrate criminal organizations .

Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
His delegation would work towards an acceptable definition of the concepts involved and the establishment of a clear standard of proof in respect of legal persons or criminal organizations , but considered that it would be difficult to reach consensus .  
An independent and impartial court required full-time judges , who should have high intellectual and moral qualities and professional competence in both criminal law and international humanitarian law .  
His delegation was also deeply concerned about the illegal arms trade carried on by organized criminal groups , which increased the likelihood of international and internal armed conflict and resulted in the destruction of national structures and cultures .  
By adopting the Statute of a permanent , independent , effective , transparent and non-selective international criminal court , the Conference would be leaving an enduring legacy to future generations .

States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural ] , administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Follow-up action has focused on the preparation of teaching materials and the translation of the United Nations standards on criminal justice in the national language for law enforcement officials , examining current penal and banking legislation and creating an effective implementing mechanism , strengthening analytical and operational capabilities , improving inter-ministerial cooperation and enhancing international mutual assistance . 
In its resolution 1997 / 35 , on technical cooperation and international advisory services in crime prevention and criminal justice , the Economic and Social Council expressed its concern at the lack of adequate resources , which might impede progress in the further operationalization of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme and hamper the implementation of those projects that had been elaborated in response to urgent requests from countries in need .  
Whereas the national or subnational knowledge base on the organized criminal groups and their operations is growing , there is no comprehensive global overview of organized crime , a requisite for effective international action to counteract this global menace .  
The degree of dangerousness will be assessed through a multidimensional approach based on different conceptual areas and related indicators that characterize organized criminal groups , such as financial strength , use of violence , capacity to infiltrate public institutions and legal environment in which they operate .  
Since its foundation , the United Nations has developed a broad range of international standards , guidelines and model treaties in crime prevention and criminal justice that represent internationally agreed upon principles of desirable practice based on the rule of law .  
Even if the case results in the summary dismissal of a staff member , the evidence may not be sufficient to satisfy the standard of proof applicable in criminal matters considered by national courts .  
The fact that an act of corruption of a public official has been committed within the sphere of operations of the organized criminal group to facilitate its unlawful activities shall be regarded as a specific aggravating circumstance .  
Their actions may fit into the context of so-called social cleansing operations , criminal activities , illegal crime control , whether organized or not , the securing of economic or political advantages by illegal means , and personal vendettas .  
Although the Anti-Rape Law of 1997 reportedly expanded the definition of rape and recognized the existence of marital rape , it nonetheless provided that [ i ] n case it is the legal husband who is the offender , the subsequent forgiveness by the wife as the offended party shall extinguish the criminal action or the penalty : Provided that the crime shall not be extinguished or the penalty shall not be abated if the marriage is void ab initio .  
Training : The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the Government 's apparent adherence to a formal notion of justice , as highlighted by the statement that [ i ] n the light of the fact that the valid Penal Code of the Slovak Republic provides for equality of justice for both men and women in criminal proceedings , no special standards for legal procedures and the conduct of persons active within the system of criminal justice that would enforce justice and equality for women have been developed .  
Controlled delivery means the technique of allowing illicit or suspect consignments [ of . . . ] to pass out of , through or into the territory of one or more countries , with the knowledge and under the supervision of their competent authorities , with a view to identifying persons involved in the commission of an offence established in article ( s ) [ . . . ]  [ of an offence covered by this Convention ] ; 1 .  Each State Party shall27 establish as criminal offences28 the following conduct :  
As an initial matter , we note that such a limitation is arbitrary in two senses : it ignores the principle that criminal culpability should be linked with the degree of personal responsibility of an individual and not partisan political factors - that justice is blind ; and it imparts to the notion of " leaders " a meaning that is at odds with the common understanding of the term .  
Provision of valid and reliable data and information , including statistical data , findings and results of action-oriented research and high-quality analysis and updated information on structures and activities of major and emerging transnational organized criminal groups , on illicit markets and on trends and patterns in the trafficking of human beings and corruption ;  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .  
Each State Party shall ensure that , subject to relevant domestic legislation of the State Party , the said legal entity may incur criminal , civil or administrative liability and is subject to effective measures taken as a result of such liability .  
It was emphasized that international agencies engaged in the provision of technical and financial assistance should take fully into account the fundamental role of criminal justice systems in the achievement of social development and economic growth .  
Provision of valid and reliable data and information , statistics , findings and results of action-oriented research , including high-quality analysis of and updated information on structures and activities of major and emerging transnational organized criminal groups , on illicit markets and on trends and patterns in the trafficking of human beings and in corruption ;  
The Institute is a public foundation established by a Decree of the President of the Republic of Italy as a not-for-profit postgraduate educational and scientific institution devoted to studies , research and the advancement of criminal sciences in the widest sense , including human rights .  The Institute was founded in Siracusa in September 1972 by the International Association of Penal Law and the City , Province , and Chamber of Commerce of Siracusa .  
The members of the Sub-Committee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
It takes place primarily between developed countries in the application of bilateral enforcement agreements , mutual legal assistance treates ( limited to criminal action aginst cartels ) , free trade , customs union or common market agreements , and the relevant OECD instruments . 
There will be increased understanding of crime trends and emerging challenges in crime prevention and criminal justice , improved expertise for Member States to draw upon and enhanced international cooperation in addressing crime prevention and criminal justice concerns that require a concerted international response .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural ] , administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
At its thirty-sixth session , in 1998 , the Commission for Social Development considered that while the primary responsibility for crime prevention and criminal justice rests at the national level , violence , crime and illicit drugs activities are of such magnitude and also have such major transnational dimensions that they require international cooperation and coordination in respect of formulating and implementing effective responses .  
Noting with great concern that many terrorist groups are connected with other criminal organizations engaged in the illegal traffic in arms and illicit drug trafficking at the national and international levels , as well as the consequent commission of serious crimes such as murder , extortion , kidnapping , assault , taking of hostages , robbery , money laundering and rape ,  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
Urges the Government of Cambodia to undertake further necessary measures to develop an independent , impartial and effective judicial system , including the early adoptions of the draft statute on magistrates , a penal code and a code on criminal procedures , as well as the reform of the administration of justice , and appeals to the international community to assist the Government of Cambodia to this end ;

Joining forces was perceived to imply not only developing innovative measures for international cooperation , but also strengthening domestic legal and criminal justice systems by adopting appropriate legislative and administrative measures and upgrading the skills of criminal justice personnel .  
Calls upon States to consider , within their legal systems , the development of means of diversion from ordinary criminal justice proceedings and mediation policies , with a view to promoting a culture favourable to mediation among law enforcement , judicial and social authorities , as well as local communities , and to consider the provision of appropriate training for those involved in the implementation of such processes ;  
Reaffirms that juvenile justice remains a high priority in the work of the Centre for International Crime Prevention and the institutes comprising the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network , in particular as children and young people , both those in conflict with the law and those in difficult circumstances who may be potential future criminals , are easy prey for criminal organizations closely linked with activities of transnational organized crime ;  
The Committee is concerned that there is currently before Congress a bill to decriminalize domestic violence at both the civil and criminal level , passing responsibility for dealing with these human rights violations to an administrative court .  
Calls upon States to consider , within their legal systems , the development of procedures to serve as alternatives to formal criminal justice proceedings and to formulate mediation and restorative justice policies , with a view to promoting a culture favourable to mediation and restorative justice among law enforcement , judicial and social authorities , as well as local communities , and to consider the provision of appropriate training for those involved in the implementation of such processes ;  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and effective criminal justice system is at the very core of economic and social development and of human security ,  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .

For the purposes of extradition under this article , the offences established in articles 3 ( [ Criminalization of ] participation in an [ organized criminal group ] ) , 4 ( Money-laundering ) , and 4 ter ( Measures against corruption ) of this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional principles and basic concepts of the domestic legal systems of States Parties .  
Controlled delivery means the technique of allowing illicit or suspect consignments [ of . . . ] to pass out of , through or into the territory of one or more countries , with the knowledge and under the supervision of their competent authorities , with a view to identifying persons involved in the commission of an offence established in article ( s ) [ . . . ]  [ of an offence covered by this Convention ] ; 1 .  Each State Party shall29 establish as criminal offences30 the following conduct :  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural , ] administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Despite the recommendations to the Colombian Government to dismantle the system of regional justice and faceless judges , efforts are being made to extend this system so as to continue unfair trials of workers , those who fight for the people , defenders of human rights and political opponents ; simply voicing an opinion that differs from the establishment view is cause enough for being put on trial .  This is tantamount to making social and popular protest a criminal offence .  
This is particularly true in cases where terrorist activity becomes strongly linked to illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs , arms traffic , political assassinations and other international organized criminal activity , 40 / or in cases where terrorism takes the form of violent insurgent activity devoted to the violent overthrow of authority - that succeeds in creating a crisis which overshadows public order and destabilizes the Government .  
The report concluded that there were substantial institutional deficiencies and that although further legislative change was required in such fields as employment and criminal and family law , such change alone would not remove the main impediments to the rule of law , which were rooted in the political environment of the court system .  
On a reciprocal basis , States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements or understandings whereby , in relation to matters that are the subject of criminal proceedings in one or more States , the judicial authorities concerned may , where necessary together with police authorities and after informing the central authority or authorities referred to in paragraph 8 of this article , act jointly within joint investigation bodies .  
Generally speaking , where an unlawful act on the part of a state authority causes damage to another person ( physical or legal ) , the civil liability for that act is incurred by the authority ( i.e . the State ) , while the public official representing that authority may incur administrative or criminal liability , but may not incur full civil liability except in certain circumstances ( for example , if the damage suffered is minor ) .  
The purpose of the Makobola massacre was to pin the blame for that criminal act on the regular forces of the Congolese Armed Forces and on their supreme commander , M'zee Laurent-Dsir Kabila , as was done recently in the slaughter of six Western tourists in Uganda ; people have sought to blame that on the Congolese State , ignoring the fact that that crime was committed in territories occupied and controlled by the aggressor States and their RCD and Mouvement de Libration du Congo ( MLC ) agents . 
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal persons held liable in accordance with this article are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal or non-criminal sanctions , including monetary sanctions .  
Within its programme on the application of internationally established standards and norms in the fields of crime prevention and justice , as well as the provision of technical cooperation , the Centres overall objectives are to ( a ) promote international cooperation in crime prevention and control ; ( b ) support the development of criminal justice systems ; and ( c ) assist Member States in addressing the challenges and threats posed by the changing nature of transnational organized crime .  
There are reports of illegal occupation of land and property in areas left by departing Albanian and Serbian local residents , as well as indications that criminal groups may be taking control of vacant housing and property in flagrant violation of the legitimate rights of the original owners and occupants . 
_ that free legal and other assistance is provided to trafficked persons and persons in prostitution in the course of any criminal , civil and other action against traffickers and those who violate the human rights of trafficked persons and persons in prostitution , including a temporary or permanent residence permit and a safe shelter ;  
Firmly announces that all foreign military recruits to be captured by the armed forces of the Islamic State of Afghanistan will be considered as criminals and would be directed to the security authorities of the State for prosecution and punishment in accordance with Afghanistan 's criminal code of 1976 , which prescribes severe punishment against those who are committing crimes against the internal and external security of the State ;  
The Security Council 's increased concern for the plight of civilians in armed conflict has been reinforced by the frequent briefings it has received on the humanitarian situation in countries affected by conflict , and is further illustrated by the establishment by the Council of international ad hoc criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda . 
Widespread reliance on information-based technologies has resulted in an unprecedented degree of global connectivity and interdependence , with the result that many aspects of national and international activity , public and private sector alike , theoretically can be put at risk by criminal or terrorist misuse .  
Take note of and adopt sanctions against Rwanda and Uganda for the systematic pillaging of the raw materials of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which is the real motive behind this invasion , contrary to the false pretext of security considerations which the two aggressor countries are flaunting in their vain , deliberate attempt to deceive the international community as to the real reasons for their criminal enterprise in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ;  
The scope of the Conference should therefore not be limited to criminal breaches of existing arms legislation and export / import controls but consideration should be given to all relevant factors leading to the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons in the context of the illicit arms trade , including those referred to in the report of the Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms .  
It is now a fully functioning international criminal court , holding regular hearings , with a normative framework completed and in operation and close and productive working relationships developed with international organizations working in the former Yugoslavia .  
The Yugoslav Government and public is concerned , in particular , over the slow and altogether inefficient investigation of daily crimes committed throughout the Province , the tolerant and protective attitude towards Albanian terrorists and criminal gangs , whereby they are encouraged to realize their plan of ethnic cleansing of all of the non-Albanian population .  
A collection of data on the status and implementation of existing multilateral , regional and bilateral agreements relating to international terrorism , including information on incidents caused by international terrorism and criminal prosecutions and sentencing , based on information received from the depositaries of those agreements and from Member States ;  
Public security in the region is threatened by the continued escalation in the rate of common crime and social violence , compounded by regional and international criminal networks .  
It is hoped that these institutions , in conjunction with the National Civil Police , the judiciary and other State institutions and government ministries responsible for public security , will provide an increasingly consolidated institutional framework for addressing criminal activity while guaranteeing permanent respect for human rights and the rule of law , in accordance with the spirit of the peace accords , and building upon the foundation of earlier achievements .  
In this regard , it is also my profound hope that the alarming levels of social and criminal violence will continue to be addressed by Governments through strengthened civilian police , more efficient judicial systems , independent ombudsmen and permanent respect for human rights and the rule of law .  
Enforcement in the Convention according to the latter meaning of the term , and thus establishment of the right of States Parties to refuse extradition on the grounds that the State requesting extradition may impose an unreasonably mild punishment on the offender , would be a risky though progressive step towards limiting even further the possibilities for members of organized criminal groups to find a safe haven .  
Even though existing international law may be excessively rigid or full of gaps or does not lend itself to the formal definition of a criminal as a mercenary , it would be wrong to invoke or interpret the existing rules either in too restrictive a manner or in such a way as to justify mercenary acts and behaviour .  
To enhance the quality of legal services available to defend accused persons , the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the Tribunal were amended at the fifth plenary session in June 1998 , to require a minimum of 10 years ' experience in criminal law or international humanitarian law for inclusion in the roster of potential Defence lawyers .  
The Ad Hoc Committee , at its fourth session , held in Vienna from 28 June to 9 July 1999 , decided that at its fifth session it would focus on articles 4 , 4 bis , 7 , 7 bis , 7 ter , 10 , 14 ( paragraphs 14-22 ) and 15-19 , dealing with money-laundering , confiscation , extradition , mutual legal assistance , special investigative techniques , transfer of proceedings , establishment of criminal record , protection of witnesses and victims , and law enforcement cooperation .  
Several Member States described criminal provisions that addressed bodily injury , noting that they were also applicable to some harmful traditional practices , such as female genital mutilation .  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and efficient criminal justice system is at the very core of economic and social development and of human security ,  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
These problems , which are linked to the inefficient functioning of the criminal justice system , are compounded by the lack of human resources , the dilapidated state of the courts , and the lack of means of communication , electricity , vehicles and office supplies , and in some cases of codes of judicial procedure .  
We know what these causes of conflict are : the huge gap between the living standards and incomes of different classes and nations ; the exponential increase in mass migration from poor to rich countries ; cultural difference and the conflicts and fanaticism it triggers ; criminal acts for the sake of glorifying or even creating a nation .  
Gravely concerned by the increasing activities of transnational organized criminal groups and others that profit from smuggling of and trafficking in human beings , especially women and children , without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ;  
The participating countries and Region should be encouraged to pass legislation to criminalize smuggling of and trafficking in human beings , especially women and children , in all its forms and purposes , including as sources of cheap labour , and to cooperate as necessary in the prosecution and penalization of all offenders , especially international organized criminal groups ;  
The UNMIK civilian police will provide a broad spectrum of basic law enforcement services , including patrolling , crime prevention , active street-level policing functions and assisting citizens and business owners in rebuilding safe and livable communities , as well as providing traffic policing , border police controls , criminal investigations , security for at-risk populations and interdiction against organized crime .  
In order to achieve their criminal aims , they actively use political , philosophical , ideological , separatist , racial , ethnic or religious slogans .  
One new P-3 legal adviser ( litigation ) , to be located in Arusha , is also proposed to review and analyse all judicial documents filed in Tribunal cases , to carry out research involving international criminal law and national jurisdictions , coordinate periodic revision of the Prosecutors Guidelines and to establish a database of the Prosecutors positions on relevant legal and factual issues .  
Each State Party , in accordance with its domestic legal principles , shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has , in that capacity , committed an offence set forth in article 2 .  Such liability may be criminal , civil or administrative .  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities liable in accordance with paragraph 1 above are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal , civil or administrative sanctions .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Measures requiring financial institutions and other professions involved in financial transactions to utilize the most efficient measures available for the identification of their usual or occasional customers , as well as customers in whose interest accounts are opened , and to pay special attention to unusual or suspicious transactions and report transactions suspected of stemming from a criminal activity . 
Adopting regulations imposing on financial institutions the obligation to report promptly to the competent authorities all complex , unusual large transactions and unusual patterns of transactions , which have no apparent economic or obviously lawful purpose , without fear of assuming criminal or civil liability for breach of any restriction on disclosure of information if they report their suspicions in good faith ;  
Controlled delivery means the technique of allowing illicit or suspect consignments [ of . . . ] to pass out of , through or into the territory of one or more countries , with the knowledge and under the supervision of their competent authorities , with a view to identifying persons involved in the commission of an offence established in article ( s ) [ . . . ]  [ of an offence covered by this Convention ] ; 1 .

States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural , ] administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Main objectives will be to introduce criminal mediation , simplify the work of roving justices of the peace , implement an expedient system of adjudication of simple cases , establish specialized tribunals and offices of the public prosecutor for complex cases and promote better coordination between the judiciary and judicial police ;  
The members of the Subcommittee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
Urges the Government of Cambodia to continue to take the necessary measures to develop an independent , impartial and effective judicial system , including through the early adoption of the draft statute on magistrates , a penal code and a code on criminal procedures , and the reform of the administration of justice , and appeals to the international community to assist the Government to this end ;  
Public official shall be understood by reference to the definition of public official in the domestic law of the State in which the person in question performs that function and as applied in its criminal law and shall include , but not be limited to , any judicial official , juror or lay judge , police official , border control or customs official , investigator , prosecutor or other official with law enforcement responsibilities in the State concerned .  
Each State Party , in accordance with its domestic legal principles , shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has , in that capacity , committed an offence set forth in article 2 .  Such liability may be criminal , civil or administrative .

Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
States Parties shall endeavour , in accordance with their constitutional principles , to reduce existing or future opportunities for organized criminal groups to participate in legal markets while acquiring proceeds of criminal offences covered by this Convention , through appropriate legislative , administrative or other measures .  
Subject to the legal principles of the State Party , the liability of legal persons may be criminal , civil or administrative and such persons , if held liable , shall be subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive sanctions , including monetary sanctions .  
Measures to prevent the corruption , by organized criminal groups , of public officials and persons who provide public services , such as feasible measures to detect and monitor the transborder movement of cash , subject to safeguards to ensure proper use of information , and to establish sufficient internal accounting controls to enable their personnel to detect acts of corruption ;  
Therefore , private investors , national and foreign , bringing new or advanced technology into the host country or developing original solutions will need to be assured that their intellectual property rights will be protected and that they will be able to enforce those rights against infringements , which may require the enactment of criminal law provisions designed to combat infringements of intellectual property rights .  
Concerned at the uncertain situation of the Centre for International Crime Prevention , her delegation believed that that body should be provided with adequate resources to provide Member States with the technical assistance needed to ensure the rule of law and juvenile justice , and to elaborate model legislation on mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
Transnational crime , which may or may not be committed by organized criminal groups , also constitutes a new challenge to conventional models of the rule of law because the rule of law is based on a traditional framework in which sovereign powers , including those to make , enforce and administer the law , are exercised at the national level .  
There is generally some tension between human rights and the effectiveness of criminal justice systems because the rights of criminal suspects are often protected by imposing substantive or procedural requirements on police and prosecutors , supported by some form of remedy for the suspect whose rights are infringed upon .  
In the strict sense outlined above , the rule of law does not exist as a crime control mechanism at the international level . 3 There is no international legislation that creates conventional offences and criminal procedures applicable to individuals in the same sense as domestic criminal laws do .  
Estimates of the number of militia fluctuate for a variety of reasons : some minor leaders and some of the rank and file are returning to East Timor ; militia are often collocated with local West Timorese and displaced persons , making it difficult to distinguish between the two ; with some militia involved in criminal activity , their identity as a pro-integration group is becoming blurred ; and significant elements of the militia leadership appear to be reviewing their plans for the future .  
Many countries share a common legal definition of what is considered to be an organized criminal group ( for example , a group composed of three or more individuals , driven by the pursuit of profit , suspected of committing or having committed serious criminal offences and existing for a prolonged or indefinite period of time ) .  
Some studies indicate that criminal groups are slowly abandoning their involvement in visible economic activities and are diverting criminal profits towards the more secretive financial sector . 7 This diversion is said to make detection more difficult and the confiscation of assets problematic . 
The entry of transnational criminal operators in the financial world is believed to herald potential disruption , distortion of rules , erosion of ethics and suppression of competition ; ultimately , it is assumed to foster a purge among entrepreneurs , leading to the survival of those more criminally fit . 
It could be argued , for example , that transnational criminal groups that invest illicit proceeds in the official economy have learned from the techniques and the rationalizations of white-collar and corporate offenders , thus being , in a sense , corrupted by the economy rather than corrupting it .  
Related to this assumption is the implicit association of this type of activity with organized crime , therefore conveying the notion that those engaged are full-time criminal entrepreneurs who have developed expertise and accumulated resources in previous illegal activities .  
Therefore criminal groups spread into sectors where the risk of being arrested and heavily sentenced is relatively low , especially compared to the attractive economic return . 15 Responses are advocated that may reduce such normative inconsistencies while reducing the mobility of transnational organized groups . 
Draft basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law have been prepared by a Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , appendix ) and deserve close scrutiny by the international criminal justice community . 
States Parties shall endeavour , in accordance with their constitutional principles , to reduce existing or future opportunities for organized criminal groups to participate in legal markets while acquiring proceeds of criminal offences covered by this Convention , through appropriate legislative , administrative or other measures .  
Other delegations expressed concern that dealing with possession was beyond the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee or that simple possession offences might not be treated as criminal offences ( as opposed to administrative or regulatory offences ) in domestic law .  
The total cost of crime to communities ( in terms of criminal justice , lost property , shattered lives and private security ) , measured as a proportion of gross domestic product , is several times greater in developing countries than in developed countries .  
He is also of the view that the dedicated protection of selected United Nations personnel undertaking operations at locations where intimidation and resistance is likely , would provide the confidence essential for more effective police operations and legal proceedings against entrenched political and criminal interests .  
It has also noted the inability of the judicial system and of the auxiliary bodies responsible for investigations to determine criminal , civil and administrative responsibility in respect of crimes with high social impact and serious human rights violations .  
In the sense of paragraph 8 of Commission resolution 1999 / 34 , the most important legal means concern those arising from penal law as provided for in the Peruvian Penal Code ( Legislative Decree No . 635 ) which permit administrative or judicial orders to characterize and sanction acts as crimes , because it is only once criminal acts are determined as such in light of the facts that an omission to prosecute and punish can be observed to generate impunity .  
On 9 November , following strong representations by KFOR and UNMIK to Kosovo Albanian leaders about reports of participation of former KLA members and potential KPC members in criminal activity , the provisional Commander of KPC , General Agim Ceku , and the rest of his senior staff issued a written communiqu condemning criminal acts committed by individuals carrying provisional KPC identity cards .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal persons held liable in accordance with this article are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal or non-criminal sanctions , including monetary sanctions .  
States Parties shall endeavour , in accordance with their constitutional principles , to reduce existing or future opportunities for organized criminal groups to participate in legal markets while acquiring proceeds of criminal offences covered by this Convention , through appropriate legislative , administrative or other measures .  
The primary question that should be answered was whether existing and future mechanisms of international criminal responsibility obviated the need for an elaboration of f " undamental standards of humanity " , given that non-State actors could be held criminally responsible for violations of international humanitarian law and human rights crimes .  
Significantly , the Genocide Convention makes individuals liable to prosecution whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers , public officials or private individuals and it envisages the establishment of international mechanisms to enforce individual criminal responsibility for major human rights violations .  
The rationale behind the permanent International Criminal Court agreed to in Rome , designed to be complementary to the domestic legal systems of States parties , is to ensure that individual perpetrators do not escape criminal justice where the State is unwilling or unable to prosecute .  
In view of the serious financial implications of the increased and unprecedented number of ex post facto presentations by field missions , regional economic commissions and international criminal tribunals to their respective local Committees on Contracts , and , when required , to the Headquarters Committee on Contracts ( " the Committee " ) , and in order to ameliorate the adverse consequences of this improper practice , the following provisions should be implemented immediately :  
With respect to procurement by field missions , regional economic commissions and international criminal tribunals in excess of $ 50 , 000 but less than $ 200 , 000 ( or the specifically delegated monetary procurement limit , if it is less ) , any such procurement action must first be submitted to the applicable local Committee on Contracts for advice to , and , if satisfactory , approval by , the Chief Administrative Officer , the Chief of Administration or other applicable head of office .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .

We are happy to conclude from the Secretary-Generals report that these advances of democracy have been strengthened in spite of internal social difficulties , compounded by regional and international criminal networks .  
While the United Nations has created a judicial affairs office that deals with the court system , the prosecution service and the correctional system in Kosovo , the OSCE Rule of Law Division which is part of the Rule of Law and Human Rights Department is tasked with developing mechanisms to ensure that the police , courts , administrative structures and other judicial structures are operating in accordance with international standards of criminal justice and human rights .  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and efficient criminal justice system is at the very core of economic and social development and of human security ,  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
Calls upon States to consider , within their legal systems , the development of procedures to serve as alternatives to formal criminal justice proceedings and to formulate mediation and restorative justice policies , with a view to promoting a culture favourable to mediation and restorative justice among law enforcement , judicial and social authorities , as well as local communities , and to consider the provision of appropriate training for those involved in the implementation of such processes ;

Joining forces was perceived to imply not only developing innovative measures for international cooperation , but also strengthening domestic legal and criminal justice systems by adopting appropriate legislative and administrative measures and upgrading the skills of criminal justice personnel .  
However , much had already been done ( including the review of measures taken to promote gender equality , the establishment of a national centre to combat ethnic discrimination , the development of a national plan of action for disabled persons ) , and Norways labour legislation had recently been amended to make discrimination based on race , colour , nationality , ethnic origin or sexual preference , in the area of employment , a criminal offence .  
The Basel Convention and the national laws of the countries visited regard the illegal traffic in dangerous waste as a criminal act liable to punishment under criminal law , regardless of any civil or administrative penalties which may be imposed on persons found guilty of such trafficking .  
Legislative Decree No . 895 of 1998 , enacted to combat organized crime by armed groups , punishes as a perpetrator of aggravated terrorism ( even if it is an ordinary offence ) any member or accomplice of a criminal group who carries firearms or explosives to commit any offence against life , physical integrity , health , property , individual freedom or public security , even if the perpetrator acts alone .  
Even though existing international law may be excessively rigid or full of gaps or does not lend itself to the formal definition of a criminal as a mercenary , it would be wrong to invoke the existing rules either in too restrictive a manner or in such a way as to justify mercenary acts and behaviour .  
With regard to the review and reform of criminal laws and correctional systems , UNDP reported that it has conducted a series of three regional training workshops on HIV law and law reform in Colombo , Beijing and Nadi , Fiji , and supported a meeting on the subject of law reform in the context of HIV AIDS and human rights in Bangalore , India , organized by the Indian Law Institute .

The criminal offence of racial and other forms of discrimination ( Penal Code of Yugoslavia , art . 54 ) , involving a violation , on the basis of race , skin colour , nationality or ethnic origin , of the fundamental human rights and freedoms recognized by the international community , is punishable by six months to five years imprisonment .  
The five _ year criminal record requirement in the Czech citizenship law , inadequate efforts to publicize the possibility of a waiver , as well as discriminatory and inconsistent application of the law ' s provisions , have deprived thousands of Roma previously resident in the Czech Republic of citizenship and its attendant benefits _ holding government office , voting , obtaining social benefits _ and have exposed them to a criminal sentence of expulsion upon conviction of a crime .  
With a view to reducing existing or future opportunities for criminal organizations to participate in legal markets while acquiring illegal gains through activities such as illegal trafficking in motor vehicles , firearms , women and children and illegal immigrants , the States Parties shall take appropriate legislative and administrative measures , in particular :

Commending the work of the Intergovernmental Expert Group Meeting on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters , held at Arlington , Virginia , United States of America , from 23 to 26 February 1998 , to implement in part resolution 52 88 by proposing complementary provisions for the Model Treaty , elements for inclusion in model legislation on mutual assistance in criminal matters , and training and technical assistance for national officials engaged in that field ,  
Concluding asset-sharing arrangements as a means of enabling forfeited proceeds of crime to be used to strengthen the capacity of national criminal justice systems and contributing a part of such proceeds to programmes such as those aimed at enhancing national capacities for fighting crime in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , paying due consideration to the rights of bona fide third parties ;  
To continue to provide advisory and technical cooperation services to Member States requesting assistance in drafting and implementing appropriate national legislation and in developing and implementing bilateral , subregional , regional or international treaties on mutual assistance in criminal matters , drawing on the expertise of Member States as appropriate ;  
In the same resolution , the Council recognized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in the enforcement of domestic and international environmental criminal laws , of promoting operational activities in that area and of protecting the environment not only at the national level but also at the international level .  
The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m . 1 Mr . YASSIN ( Sudan ) said that his countrys constructive contributions at all the stages leading to the Conference reflected its strong support for the establishment of a permanent international criminal court whose existence would make it impossible for those who committed monstrous crimes against humanity to escape punishment . 
Mr . SLADE ( Samoa ) said that the aspiration to establish a permanent international criminal court had occupied the international community for much of the twentieth century , which had experienced the horrors of two world wars and the atrocities of countless civil conflicts . 
Mr . AL-BUSAIDY ( Oman ) said that he looked forward to the establishment of an international criminal court which would help to put an end to bloodshed and prosecute those responsible for such heinous crimes as ethnic cleansing , aggression , genocide , torture and the forcible transfer of defenceless civilians .  
In particular , he supported the creation of an effective , independent , impartial , efficient , universal international criminal court .  
Mr . LEWIS ( United Nations Childrens FundUNICEF ) said that the establishment of an effective and fair international criminal court would send the unequivocal message from the international community that heinous violations of human rights could not go unpunished .  
To find the support it deserved , the ICC must be complementary to national criminal courts , intervening where local courts were unable or unwilling to act .  
He welcomed the plan to establish a permanent international criminal court , which should be independent , strong and impartial , and linked with the United Nations through a special agreement to guarantee its universality and authority.It should be created by means of a treaty . 
The community of nations had a fundamental interest in contributing to a more stable world by creating an international criminal court that was independent , effective and fair .  
Mr . PACE ( Observer for the World Federalist Movement on behalf of the Coalition for an International Criminal Court ) , speaking on behalf of the 800 member organizations of the Coalition , said that the establishment of an international criminal court would represent a monumental advance , acting as a deterrent and strengthening national legal systems for prosecuting crimes against humanity . 
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , administrative or technical opportunities for criminal organizations to commit profitable crimes and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Moreover , the accuseds spouse , legitimate or acknowledged illegitimate forebears or descendants , legitimate collateral blood relatives up to the fourth degree or relatives by marriage up to the second degree and siblings born out of wedlock are not required to testify in a criminal case ( article 201 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) .  
Reports mention the poor food , the sharing of cells with people who have committed criminal acts , and harsh treatment by police officers ( made all the more easy by the fact that the illegal persons status makes it more difficult for them to gain access to official legal channels ) , all of which has apparently led to the death of a number of immigrants while in detention . 
The Ministry is keen to raise the currently very low level of public awareness of commercial sexual exploitation of children as a human rights issue as well as the low priority given to such activities by the police in view of the difficulties of inadequate resources and their preoccupation with what is considered more serious criminal activity .  
This criminal military attack on peaceful regions , which follows constant military attacks by the United States and the United Kingdom on long-suffering Iraq , is indicative of an established policy of those two States designed to achieve their political objectives , their goal being to violate the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
Encourages Governments to take effective and expeditious measures , particularly the enactment or amendment , if necessary , of domestic legislation to provide appropriate penalties , such as substantial imprisonment , fines and forfeiture , in order to combat all aspects of organized criminal activities related to trafficking at the international level in women and children ;  
Reviewing the achievements of the Committee at the current session , especially the addition of new elements to previous resolutions , he noted that , as far as the resolution on the establishment of an international criminal court was considered , there had been broad agreement on the historic significance of the adoption of the Rome Statute and on the need to embark upon the practical arrangements for the commencement of the functions of the Court .  
This criminal , unprecedented act of aggression , in clear support of separatism and terrorism , has already caused massive human losses and enormous destruction of civilian infrastructure all over Yugoslavia , thus provoking enormous humanitarian suffering .  
He noted that the recent upsurge in transnational crime had resulted in the penetration of central Asia by criminal groups and that the development of effective legislative frameworks and legal mechanisms for fighting crime had become a priority of the new sovereign States in that area .  
The Russian Federation , which was taking strong anti-crime measures at the national and international levels , had recently signed the 1990 European Convention on Laundering Search , Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime and had ratified European conventions on extradition and reciprocal legal assistance in criminal matters .  
Urges the Government of Cambodia to continue to take the necessary measures to develop an independent , impartial and effective judicial system , including through the early adoption of the draft statute on magistrates , a penal code and a code on criminal procedures , and the reform of the administration of justice , and appeals to the international community to assist the Government to this end ;  
Illegal trafficking in and transporting of migrants shall mean any act committed by a transnational organized criminal group for the purpose of procuring the undocumented or irregular entry of a person into a State of which the person is not a national or resident ;  
The two sides maintain that international terrorism , religious extremism and national separatism in all its forms , as well as transnational criminal activities ( such as illicit trafficking in arms , narcotic drugs and psychotropic and explosive substances , and economic offences ) have now become serious threats to the security of sovereign States and to international peace and security .  
Thus , cultural , political , economic and legal measures , including criminal justice , to prevent and fight corruption can not be divorced from broader processes of political democratization , economic and social development and reliability of financial and legal transactions .  
The Convention requires that bribery of foreign public officials be punishable by effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal penalties comparable with those applicable to bribery of domestic officials .  
The Board took the position that issues of criminal intent or misrepresentation required judicial rather than administrative proceedings , with full due process and legal representation for the individual concerned .  
At the other end of the scale , small arms and light weapons obtained through illicit trade account for much of the political , ethnic and criminal killings and human suffering that occur in the less affluent countries of the world .  
The Convention and the two Protocols address sensitive issues and set up a complex normative system on matters such as criminal law , in which differences between national legislations make the drafting of international laws particularly difficult .  
Establishing or increasing , where necessary , the level of control and monitoring of web sites relating to controlled pharmaceuticals and precursor chemicals , including possible criminal , civil and administrative penalties consistent with national laws ;

In the discussion on the definition of organized criminal group , the Ad Hoc Committee agreed that the term financial or other material benefit should be understood broadly to include , for example , personal or sexual gratification . 
Other delegations expressed concern that dealing with possession was beyond the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee or that simple possession offences might not be treated as criminal offences ( as opposed to administrative or regulatory offences ) in domestic law .

The fair and efficient management and administration of criminal justice , with due regard paid to human rights , were recognized as fundamental prerequisites for social and economic development .  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and efficient criminal justice system is an important factor in the promotion of economic and social development and of human security ,  
Different legal systems approach familiar issues in different ways , and what is emerging in the Tribunals is a unique blend of ideas and practice , one that incorporates diverse features from major national criminal justice systems . 
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal persons held liable in accordance with this article are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal or noncriminal sanctions , including monetary sanctions .

As such , the ambitions of his own country and others for the creation of an effective and transparent international criminal system in which it was not simply a case of the strong accusing the weak had been disappointed .  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and efficient criminal justice system is an important factor in the promotion of economic and social development and of human security ,  
The need for security is likely to increase as local police , advised by IPTF , have begun to undertake robust operations against local and international organized criminal groups involved in prostitution , drug trafficking and illegal migration .  
Convinced of the importance of establishing a restrictive national legislative and / or regulatory framework for , inter alia , small arms and light weapons , including criminal sanctions and effective administrative control ,  
We wish therefore to join the Secretary-General in calling for a culture of protection in our time , based on the elements he mentions in his report ( S / 2001 / 331 ) : strengthened criminal justice systems ; regional approaches to the protection of refugees and to monitoring humanitarian situations that could endanger peace ; greater guarantees of access by humanitarian organizations to the victims of conflict ; and greater participation by civil society , including the media and the private sector , in efforts to create a broad network for the protection of civilians .  
My Government , the British Government , has a simple message for terrorists and those who support terrorism : terrorism , the deliberate targeting of innocent people for political ends , is criminal , and there is no political , religious or ideological cause which can possibly justify the use of such indiscriminate violence .  
Yet it must be acknowledged that the proceedings have already been substantially transformed by the four major reforms I have just mentioned and can no longer be appreciably amended without interfering with the fundamental features of an international criminal trial as defined by the Council in the statute .  
But we have established that both the genocide in Rwanda and the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia were highly organized criminal enterprises centrally organized at the highest level , and pursued with enthusiasm at the regional and local levels .  
These developments have contributed to improving protection of individuals in all situations through , for example , the elaboration of the rules applicable in internal armed conflict , the establishment of individual criminal responsibility under international law for violations of laws applicable to all armed conflicts and the clarification of the conditions under which a State may be held responsible for acts by non-State entities .  
Objective : To strengthen international cooperation and assistance to Governments in tackling crime problems such as those posed by transnational organized crime , trafficking in persons , economic and financial crime , including money laundering , corruption , illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , as well as to promote fair and efficient criminal justice systems .  
Following his visit to Cuba , he had addressed communications to the countries whose territories had been utilized by the individuals and organizations that , in violation of international law and their own national legislation , had planned and directed , according to the available evidence , a number of criminal acts which must not remain unpunished .  
He wished to know whether the Special Rapporteur was participating in the preparatory regional meetings for the World Conference , whether he had attended the preparatory meeting in Strasbourg and what his relations were with the Council of Europe , which was intimately concerned with issues of racism and racial discrimination .  52 .  Regarding contemporary forms of racism , he wondered whether the Special Rapporteur considered that they were linked with new forms of criminal behaviour , inter-ethnic conflict and economic discrimination .  
The Committee is similarly concerned by the different minimum legal ages for marriage , the absence of a defined minimum age of sexual consent for boys , the very high minimum age for consulting a doctor without parental consent and the extremely low minimum age of criminal responsibility - currently age seven .  
Of the 38 replies received , one , from a Member State , reported having appointed a focal point for international technical cooperation projects in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and 9 respondents ( 24 per cent ) , 8 of which were Member States , indicated that they did use the instrument distributed by the Centre .  
However , the fact that only nine responses indicated that their authors used the instrument developed by the Centre renders those responses of limited value for analytical , comparative or statistical purposes , or for the purpose of establishing a consolidated database for coordination of and information on international technical cooperation projects in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
The form of the assistance included study tours and training and the fields covered were corruption , crime detection , crime prevention strategies , criminal information collection and analysis , customs , drug-related crime , economic crime , evidence-gathering , extradition , financial investigation , institutional structures , institution-building , investigation materials , international standards and human rights , juvenile justice , money-laundering investigations , mutual legal assistance and organized crime .  
The overall experience reported above by HEUNI and the very limited number of responses received by the Centre for International Crime Prevention to the questionnaire on international technical cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice suggest that the establishment of a centralized database is of very limited value and utility , in particular when one considers the overall quality and content of the responses .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention , are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities liable in accordance with paragraph 1 above are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal , civil or administrative sanctions .  
The development and implementation of effective measures at the national level is essential to enable each State to combat domestic money-laundering activities , to avoid becoming a haven for money-laundering by foreign organized criminal groups and to cooperate effectively with other States in the international effort to combat money-laundering .  
Implementation of the objective will result in more effective tools to combat domestic and transnational aspects of money-laundering , with a consequent reduction of the ability of organized criminal groups to derive benefits from their proceeds and to dedicate illicit resources to further criminal activities .  
Several representatives informed the Commission of initiatives taken by their Governments to promote judicial cooperation , as an essential tool to target drug-trafficking organizations and ensure the full implementation of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 .  [ 1 ] Several representatives referred to the bilateral and multilateral treaties and arrangements concluded by their Governments to facilitate the extradition of drug traffickers , promote mutual legal assistance in criminal matters , including the transfer of proceedings , and counter illicit traffic by sea .  
The action taken in response to that trend included the following : renewed support for law enforcement authorities in combating synthetic drugs ; the establishment of joint agency units ; specialist training for customs and police officials ; increased support for demand reduction programmes directed against ATS ; and further strengthening of treaties of mutual legal assistance to ensure successful investigation and prosecution of those engaged in such criminal activity .  
Emphasizing that at the twentieth special session of the General Assembly , devoted to countering the world drug problem together , States undertook to promote multilateral , regional , subregional , and bilateral cooperation among judicial and law enforcement authorities to deal with criminal organizations involved in drug-related offences ,  
In this context it is important to differentiate between piracy , which is an international crime under international law and can only be committed on the high seas and in the exclusive economic zone , and any other illicit acts or criminal actions committed within the jurisdiction of a State , which are therefore punishable under national law .  
Referring to State and institutional violence against children , which he understood to involve torture and maltreatment inflicted upon children by members of the police and security forces , especially during preventive detention , he appealed to States to punish those responsible for such violations and to take tangible measures to protect the rights of children suspected , accused or found guilty of violations of criminal law .  
Calls upon the Russian Federation to ensure that both civilian and military prosecutors offices undertake systematic , credible and exhaustive criminal investigations and prosecutions of all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights , in particular of those members of federal forces , federal servicemen and the personnel of law enforcement agencies against civilians allegedly implicated in war crimes and human rights violations and to pursue with rigour the cases which have been referred to them ;  
Noting with great concern that many terrorist groups are connected with other criminal organizations engaged in the illegal traffic in arms and illicit drug trafficking at the national and international levels , as well as the consequent commission of serious crimes such as murder , extortion , kidnapping , assault , taking of hostages , robbery , money laundering and rape ,  
Reaffirming that no one should be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , that such actions constitute a criminal attempt to destroy a fellow human being physically and mentally , which can never be justified under any circumstances , by any ideology or by any overriding interest , and convinced that a society that tolerates torture can never claim to respect human rights , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
Urges the Government of Cambodia to continue to take the necessary measures to develop an independent , impartial and effective judicial system , including through the early adoption of the draft statute on magistrates , a penal code , a code on criminal procedures , a new civil code and a code of civil procedure , the reform of the administration of justice and enhancing the training of judges and lawyers , and appeals to the international community to assist the Government to this end ;  
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in species of wild flora and fauna and to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 3 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in endangered species of wild flora and fauna ,  
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna ,  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 3 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna , in furtherance of the principles of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with illicit access to genetic resources and also the extent to which organized criminal groups are involved therein and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna ,  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 11 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna , in furtherance of the principles of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with illicit access to genetic resources and also the extent to which organized criminal groups are involved therein and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
I am also concerned at the deterioration in public security , reflected in an increase in crime , in actions by armed criminal groups and in the continuing very serious threats against persons involved in criminal proceedings and intimidation of members of non-governmental human rights organizations .  
Aliens shall be equal before the courts and tribunals , and shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent , independent and impartial tribunal established by law in the determination of any criminal charge or of rights and obligations in a suit at law .  
In view of the likelihood of a hot summer resulting from the criminal actions of extremist elements opposed to increased minority returns and the reconstruction of historic religious sites , my Special Representative is engaging intensively with political , religious and community leaders and police officials to seek a substantial improvement in their mutual cooperation as an essential element in improving police performance .  
It is , moreover , well-understood that the illegal use of force in international relations will be considered under customary international law , international human rights and humanitarian law , the law of armed conflict and international criminal law .  
The mission , composed of representatives of the Department for Disarmament Affairs , the Department of Political Affairs and the UNDP Cambodia Office , visited Cambodia from 23 to 30 January 2001 and concluded that Cambodias fragile peace was indeed threatened by the uncontrolled proliferation of small arms and light weapons , which not only destabilized the countrys delicate political balance , but also contributed to a dramatic increase in criminal activity and the attendant insecurity of the population . 
Urges States to work with law enforcement agencies in designing , implementing and enforcing effective policies and programmes to prevent , detect and ensure accountability for incidents of police misconduct motivated by race or ethnic origin , to prosecute such police misconduct and to eliminate racial profiling by law enforcement officials or the use of race or ethnicity as the sole basis for determining if an individual is engaged in criminal activity ;  
For the purposes of effectively combating racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance in the civil , political , economic , social and cultural fields , the World Conference recommends to all Member States that their national legislative framework in criminal , civil and administrative law should expressly and specifically prohibit discrimination on grounds of actual or presumed racial , ethnic or national origin , religion and belief and provide effective judicial and other remedies or redress , including through the designation of national , independent , specialized bodies .  
To adopt and implement , in the States that have not already done so , the necessary legislative or other measures to establish as criminal offences under their domestic law the illegal manufacture , possession , stockpiling and trade of small arms and light weapons within their areas of jurisdiction , in order to ensure that those engaged in such activities can be prosecuted under appropriate national penal codes .  
To ensure that all confiscated , seized or collected small arms and light weapons are destroyed , subject to any legal constraints associated with the preparation of criminal prosecutions , unless another form of disposition or use has been officially authorized , and provided that such weapons have been duly marked and registered .  
A monthly average of 300 crimes have been reported to the police , half of which constitute cases of theft or personal assault , in particular domestic violence , and criminal investigations have been completed in over 80 per cent of the cases .  
With greater support from the General Assembly and the Commission , the Special Rapporteur will thus be enabled to continue to investigate such phenomena as the role of mercenaries in internal or international armed conflicts affecting the right of peoples to self-determination and at the same time to consider other phenomena in which mercenaries have a criminal involvement , such as illicit trafficking , terrorism and the formation of mercenary teams by private security companies , which use them to intervene in the internal affairs of States with which the companies sign contracts .  
The problems in Africa have only worsened , particularly in the western portion of the continent , rich in high-quality diamonds and in mineral and petroleum resources , which arouse the greed of unscrupulous politicians , merchants operating in the global market and members of criminal organizations who enrich themselves by plundering and smuggling gems and precious stones . 
That being so , although at one time the definition was considered to be a first step , the current tendency is to describe it as partial , inadequate , applying only to international conflicts and inapplicable to new approaches such as the one involving the criminal responsibility of artificial persons ( private security firms ) that hire and employ mercenaries who violate human rights .  
It was assumed that the end of colonialism , the cold war and apartheid would relieve the sufferings of many African peoples ; instead , the situation has deteriorated further , particularly in the western portion of the continent , rich in high-quality diamonds and mineral and petroleum resources , which arouse the greed of unscrupulous politicians , merchants operating in the global market and criminal gangs who enrich themselves by plundering and smuggling gems and precious stones . 
Similar provisions protecting religious freedom and prohibiting any discrimination against citizens whether or not they are believers are contained in criminal law , civil law , legislation governing regional autonomy for national minorities and military service , compulsory education legislation , the electoral law relating to the Peoples Congress and the law establishing village committees .  
Faced with the increasingly opaque web of local and global politics , economic interests and criminal activity that characterizes many of todays conflicts , we must make the best use of organizations limited resources by engaging all relevant actors in our work to improve the protection of civilians .  
The Ministers recalled that the illicit trade in small arms in the region is mainly associated with drug trafficking , terrorism , transnational organized crime , mercenary activities and other criminal acts , and held that crime prevention must therefore be an integral part of the approach to combating the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects . 
In other words , States that were previously in a position to ensure a legal regime of information exchange at their own internal level find themselves defenceless , in the new situation , against the transmission from abroad to their territory of information which may be unlawful or destructive , including pornography , disinformation , information indicative of racial discrimination or intolerance , information aimed at inciting social , national or religious hatred , information of a subversive nature or information emanating from and serving the interests of international criminal and terrorist groups .  
The manifestations of that daily horror are daily massacres of the civilian population , summary and extrajudicial executions , the deportation of entire populations , the taking of hostages , hijacking , the illegal capture and destruction of aircraft , the systematic rape and burying alive of women , destitution , other serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law , the deliberate and criminal spread of HIV / AIDS , and so forth .  
The General Assembly of the United Nations has done important and indispensable work in recent years to build a consensus on the basic principle that terrorist acts , wherever and by whomever they are committed , are criminal and unjustifiable by any political , religious or philosophical considerations .  
He also recognizes that progress has been made in addressing a number of historical human rights violations committed by the former government prior to October 2000 , including the release of many political prisoners , investigations into the fate of persons of different ethnic groups missing during the armed conflict in Kosovo in 1999 and criminal investigations into murdered or other disappeared persons .

A group of leading cadres in Liaoning Province who violated policies by occupying too many houses , illegally taking funds for housing purchases , illegally turning public houses into private ones , and using public funds to renovate houses beyond the standard were investigated and handled sternly .  Party and government disciplinary measures were taken against 62 cadres at or above the county department level in the province , and eight people were transferred to judicial organs to be investigated and affixed criminal responsibilities .  
Over the last year , the form and scope of making procuratorial work open have continued to broaden - - we have established a procuratorial work report system and a rights and obligations briefing system ; we have experimented on a system to open examination of civil and administrative counterappeal cases , nonprosecution cases , and criminal petition cases ; and procuratorial work has been made more transparent , which has been well received by the public .  
The fundamental reason why he degenerated from a senior cadre into a corrupt element and a criminal against the people is that he abandoned the program of serving the people and the ideals and beliefs of a communist , harbored different ambitions from the party , and was greedy for power , money , and sex , and his selfish desires swelled up to a tremendous degree .  
The aforementioned matters are major matters that concern the state 's basic political system , economic system , and civil , criminal , and other legal systems .  
Last year , it resolutely punished criminal elements who attempted to subvert state power and split the country .  In the struggle against the cult organization " Falungong , " the judicial contingent strictly applied the Criminal Law and relevant judicial explanations and sternly cracked down on criminal activities of organizing and using cult organizations to undermine enforcement of laws , cause deaths , and obtain state secrets illegally .  
In addition , the judicial contingent also tried a number of criminal cases of major impact , sternly punished criminal activities that harmed the order of the market economy , thereby protecting legal rights and interests of various economic sectors in the midst of reform and opening up , and ensuring healthy development of our country 's economy .  
2 .  Article Three of General Work Principles shall be amended as " The national committee and local committees of CPPCC shall implement the strategy of running the country in accordance with the law ; publicize and enforce ( carry out ) the constitution , laws , and various principles and policies of the state ; and mobilize social forces to actively take part in the cause of building material civilization and socialist spiritual civilization ( assist the state organs in cracking down on criminal activities aimed at sabotaging socialism in economic field and other fields ) . "  
it is necessary to do a good job of effectively carrying out nationality , religious , national defense , diplomatic , and Taiwan affairs work , to resolutely fight sabotage activities carried out by hostile forces at home and abroad , and to combat various law-violating and criminal activities , so as to maintain social and political stability , the unity of the motherland , and national security and to create a good international and domestic environment for reform and development .  
criminal activities are on the rise in financial computer systems and e-commerce systems ; the CIH virus , BO hacker procedures , and other harmful databases have been spread far and wide .  Some hackers at home and abroad illegally intruded into information systems in important areas of China , attacking websites and stealing state or commercial secrets .  
They should rectify and improve public order inside and around schools and sternly crack down on various illegal and criminal activities that jeopardize the normal order in school and should strengthen community development and actively create a harmonious environment in families and neighborhoods to conscientiously guarantee the youngsters ' healthy growth .  
He said : Now we already have copyright laws and pertinent criminal laws throughout the country .  In 1998 we further published laws and regulations against the smuggling of pirated goods .  We will also use for reference relevant foreign laws as well as laws in Hong Kong and Macao Regions , in strengthening administrative norms and making judicial interpretations of the antipiracy crackdown to make full use of legal weapons to crack down on piracy and protect intellectual property rights .  
In light of the rampant momentum of illegal publishing activities , in December 1998 , with emphasis from the central leading comrades , the Director of the Working Group on " Eliminating Pornography and Fighting Illegal Publications " , Wang Maolin , convened a conference attended by a dozen or so central organizations .  The conference studies ways to make full use of legal weapons and increase the use of criminal penalties .  
For illegal publications whose content was not pornographic or criminal , but which had not gone through the approval process , this judicial explanation made it clear that seriously lurid publications and the disruption of orderly markets could be punished as " illegal business operations " .  
Like their civilian counterparts , the legal affairs that military lawyers have to handle involve those relevant to criminal , civil , economic , administrative , maritime , and financial laws , and so they must be totally familiar with the laws and regulations of the country so that they can properly handle the legal affairs in the armed forces and legal affairs that involve both military and civilian departments ;  
However , in terms of law enforcement and construction of the ranks of cadres , there are some problems that can not be overlooked : The effort made in cracking down on criminal and economic crimes is not responsive to the needs of the current severe public security situation .  
All of the five cases were tracked out by Guangzhou City this year .  Among them , the four criminal cases concluded by the city intermediate court even startled the national leading group for wiping out pornography and cracking down on illegal publications and were major cases with a nationwide impact in the area of wiping out pornography and cracking down on illegal publications .  
The Macao police have also cultivated healthy trends and made energetic efforts to investigate and crack major cases ; have strengthened cooperation with the people and exchanged information or cooperated with the police forces in neighboring regions ; have severely cracked down on criminal activities , thus lowering the crime rate and raised the rate of cracking cases ;  
The rate of serious crimes committed during the first three quarters this year was lower by a great extent compared to the same period of 1999 , and the rate of cracking criminal cases has obviously risen high .  The violent criminal activities are being held back and have been hit .  The vast Macao people are clapping and are very happy .  
After launching a special campaign to crack down on criminal and vicious groups throughout the country , China has successfully destroyed some criminal and vicious groups , cracked down on a large number of major and serious criminal cases , and severely punished many criminals .  The people have clapped and cheered .  
However , some local criminal and vicious groups are rapidly developing and their activities are becoming more and more vicious in recent years .  They have been using extremely cruel measures , which seriously undermine public security in society .  They have gradually become destructive and harmful criminal groups of Mafia nature .  
According to a preliminary police investigation , Liu Qijun 's criminal gang was involved in a total of 14 criminal cases including killing , robbery , rape , illicit possession of firearms , arson , compulsory business dealings , crimes of affray , and hindrance of official duties .  As a result of the crimes committed by the gang , two people died , five people received serious injuries , and more than 20 people suffered light injuries .  
Similar to the criminal syndicates outside of Mainland China , domestic criminal and vicious groups have tried one-thousand and one ways to place themselves under a " protective umbrella . "  They have tried by hook or by crook to infiltrate into party and government organizations to seek political protection even to the point of directly seizing political power .  This is an extremely dangerous signal .  It is terribly harmful .  
Under the supervision of the Ministry of Public Security , the police authorities in Zhejiang had cracked down the " Zhang-Wang major case " of Mafia nature .  A hearing will be held soon .  The large criminal gang led Zhang Wei and Wang Xiufang is suspected of committing eight crimes including intentional homicide , unlawful detention , lending frauds , and so on .  
It is for this reason that Comrade Luo Gan put forward at the mobilization meeting that efforts must be made to ferret out and severely punish according to law the " protective umbrellas " and the backstage supporters in the party , government and judicial organs who support the criminal and vicious groups .  It is also essential to thoroughly destroy the social soil that breeds the criminal and vicious groups , he said .  
But since reform and opening up , under the influence of negative social effects and with the intrusive corrosion of overseas criminal syndicates , some criminal groups engaging in various serious felonious activities are gradually appearing in our country .  Their activities are becoming more and more rampant and the scales bigger and bigger .  Some have developed into criminal organizations with the character of a criminal syndicate .  
In sum , judicial and law-enforcing organs have punished the " Falungong " criminals , who disturbed social order with ulterior motives , not because they have practiced " Falungong " but because they have conducted unlawful and criminal activities and violated China 's laws .  
At around midnight yesterday , under unified arrangement of the Ministry of Public Security and the Public Security Department of Hubei Province , policemen from public security organs of Wuhan City were out in full force and doing their utmost to carry out a comprehensive and nonstop search for Jin Ruchao , the major criminal suspect in the Shijiazhuang explosions .  
It is necessary make cracking down on tax theft and fraudulent taxation , smuggling and other criminal activities that seriously damage the socialist market economic order an important task that is firmly grasped and coordinated with the relevant departments so that the market economic order can be corrected and codified .  
Over the past few years , the public security organs have adopted resolute measures to " strike at triad activities or weed out local tyrants ; " have ruthlessly cracked down on all types of illegal or criminal activities by cracking one batch of major or serious cases after another or rounding up in the net of law one criminal guilty of flagrant crimes after another ; and have thereby upheld justice , deterred crimes , or maintained social stability .  
The public security organs across the country should adhere to the principle of striking hard by ruthlessly cracking down on all types of criminal activities in accordance with the law .  At the moment , we should especially concentrate on cracking down on crimes of extreme violence , organized crimes , drug-related crimes , gun-related crimes , or explosive-related crimes and should resolutely weed out all criminal elements swollen with arrogance .  
The continual loss of resources of state authority and economic and fiscal resources supporting such authority resources makes the government 's command implementation mechanisms exist in name only , rendering the state totally incapable of fighting big entrenched benefit-distribution groups in society and criminal groups in society .  
In this exclusive campaign to " crack down on Mafia rings , " the Cixi City Public Security Bureau worked for over two months .  It destroyed in one stroke a particularly large Mafia-type criminal organization headed by Hunan criminal suspect Li Lixin and made up of 44 members that committed diverse crimes such as collecting and selling drugs , robbery , organized prostitution , and illegal possession of guns .  In which , it cracked over 40 cases .  
We must strictly hold the leading cadres concerned accountable for failure to attach importance to public order work , which results in major incidents or accidents , in inability to crack down for a long time on local major crimes and criminal forces , in failure to resolve major public order problems over a long period , and in failure to transform for a long time areas and units where public order is chaotic .  
In upholding the people 's democratic dictatorship , we must properly preserve national sovereignty , security , unity , and stability on the basis of people 's democracy , crack down hard according to law on lawbreaking and criminal activities that jeopardize the socialist system , reform , opening up , and socialist modernization , and people 's lives and property , and give full play to its role in protecting the people and cracking down on the enemy .  
can we crush the arrogance of criminal elements and boost the moral of the masses ; can we implement the various measures for comprehensive management of public security in real earnest ; and can we effectively ensure the healthy economic and social development .  
In the current struggle , we must create an awe-inspiring situation , fully mobilize the masses , strengthen mass prevention and mass treatment , and spread a far-lung network with which to prevent and crack down on crime so that criminal elements whose cases are serious will be held in awe and hit hard , and those who committed petty crimes will repent and make a fresh start and begin their lives anew .  
This meeting fully affirmed the results of the special campaign at the previous stage against smuggling , foreign exchange evasion , illegal foreign exchange remittance , and deceptive acquisition of tax reimbursement for export , as well as the joint operation against the law-breaking and criminal activities of producing and selling counterfeit and shoddy commodities ; thoroughly analyzed the severity and harmfulness of existing market economic disorder and the major causes of these problems ; set the principal tasks of rectifying and regulating the market economic order in the next five years and the work focuses this year ;  
The meeting pointed out : We must achieve phased results in the above-mentioned five respects in one year or so , so that the ongoing spread of law-breaking and criminal activities that seriously disrupt the market economic order will be markedly contained ; big and important cases that the people have strong resentment at , that have serious consequences and adverse repercussions will be exposed and dealt with ; criminal elements who break the law will be severely punished ;  
Liang Guoju , director of the provincial Public Security Department of Guangdong , called a special teleconference the other day to lay out tasks for public security organs throughout the province ; meanwhile , he urged all localities across the province to publicize in the coming few days each 's results in the comprehensive management of local social security , including the number of criminal rings of an underworld triad nature and the number of suspects that each locality had successfully smashed and arrested .  
Jiang Zemin stressed : In the future , if serious crimes and the activities of criminal gangs are not severely suppressed over a long period , if major law-and-order problems are not resolved effectively over a long period , if the chaotic conditions in public order are not changed over a long period , then local leading cadres and leaders of the relevant departments will be punished for neglecting their duties .  
At present , according to the arrangements of the State Council , actions should be focused on cracking down on the activities of making and selling counterfeit commodities , regularizing the construction market , punishing criminal offenders involved in tax evasion and tax frauds , breaking departmental monopoly and local blockade , straightening out the market for cultural products , thus laying a good foundation for the fundamental improvement of the order of the market economy in the period of the Tenth Five-Year Plan .  
Thus , the fight to uproot the evil forces must proceed along with consolidating the market 's economic order and with cracking down on crimes committed in the economic sector .  Law enforcement departments must take joint actions to investigate the economic crimes committed by organizations that operate like criminal syndicates , close their unlawful businesses , freeze their illegal capital , confiscate their unlawful incomes , and destroy their economic foundations that they count on to subsist and develop .  
The criminal syndicates and evil forces often use unscrupulous tactics to collect illegitimate wealth and frantically seek profits .  They use the syndicate to protect businesses , while letting the businesses " feed " the " syndicate . "  They have seriously disrupted the economic order of the state and hampered the reform and opening-up program and the smooth development of the socialist modernization drive .  
The vicious growth of criminal syndicates and evil forces has become a prominent issue that affects China 's public security and social order .  It has also become a major disaster that prevents the people from leading a peaceful and happy life .  
Corruption is a hotbed for breeding criminal syndicates and the evil forces .  Behind all the criminal syndicates cracked by the public security organs , there are always well-connected networks and " protective umbrellas " that are complicated and difficult to deal with .  
All these arguments , which confuse right and wrong and confound black and white , are attempts to cover up Japan 's criminal history of aggression with a " beautiful veil " and deceive the future generations so as to attain the aim of completely changing the traditional evaluation of the war of aggression .  
At the mass rally to openly mete out punishments to a batch of serious criminals in Chongqing Municipality , the public security bureau announced the arrests of 92 members of criminal gangs bearing the character of the Mafia , despotic hooligans , and suspected criminals in some serious cases , and announced administrative detentions of six suspected criminals .  
Besides , efforts will also be made to severely crack down on criminal activities that disturb the economic order , such as making and selling forged money , tax evasion and tax frauds , and producing fake goods .  Areas where the market order is seriously chaotic and numerous criminal cases have occurred and places where economic crimes have run rampant are regarded as key points in the strike-hard struggle .  
The State Planning Commission urged severely cracking down on serious criminal activities in the economic sector in active cooperation with relevant departments in carrying out the struggle to " strike hard " and put things in order , comprehensively strengthening public order and solving the pronounced problems facing market economic order , and striving for remarkable successes in this regard as quickly as possible .  
Only when strong pressure is always maintained on criminal elements and the haughty arrogance of criminal elements is crushed can social stability and public order move toward the direction of favorable development .  
The Supreme People 's Court today issued a circular , requiring that law courts at all levels throughout the country seriously implement the central arrangements , give full play to the role of their judicial function in trying criminal cases , rapidly devote all strength to the " hard striking " anticrime struggle , resolutely mete out severe punishments to criminal offenders according to the laws , effectively perform their important duties of punishing criminals , maintaining social and political stability , and protecting the life and property safety of the masses .  
The circular also urges courts at all levels to hold open trials on typical cases and explain the law in the light of criminal cases , thereby enabling the broad masses of people to continuously enhance the awareness and ability to use laws to protect and safeguard their own legitimate rights and interests , as well as fostering a prevail atmosphere of socialist business ethics of honesty and trust in the whole society through meting out severe punishments on crimes in disrupting the market economic order .  
and he was a recidivist .  In accordance with the relevant provisions of the criminal law , Shijiazhuang Intermediate People 's Court sentenced Jin Ruchao to death , with permanent deprivation of his political rights , under the charge of causing explosions and , separately , sentenced him to death , with permanent deprivation of his political rights , under the charge of voluntary manslaughter .  It ruled that the death penalty be executed and his political rights deprived for life .

The Supreme People 's Procuratorate urges procuratorial and public security organs throughout the country to incorporate the special operation into the unified plans for the nationwide " strike-hard " campaign , and to continue to intensify efforts on the pursuit and arrest work .  It is necessary to truly implement the state 's criminal law and policy by honoring the policy of leniency for suspects who voluntarily surrender to the authority and who take the initiative to return illicit money .  
The open announcements of verdicts on the trials of the exceptionally serious serial crimes of Zhang Jun and Li Zejun embodied the firm determination of the judicial organs to mete out heavy , swift and severe punishments on criminals in accordance with law and persist in dealing " sure , accurate and ruthless " blows on all kinds of criminal activities that seriously undermine public order . 
2 .  Criminals who have surrendered themselves within the time limit prescribed in this circular will be given light or reduced punishment .  For those whose crimes are relatively minor or who have behaved quite well by reporting and exposing others ' criminal acts , providing tips for cracking down on other criminal cases , stopping others from committing serious crimes , or assisting the public security department in arresting escaped criminals , more lenient treatment will be given in accordance with the law .  
All localities , in the light of local situations , should clearly set the objectives , focus on key tasks , and strive to achieve practical results .  We should not only decidedly wipe out criminal forces and pressure groups already uncovered , but also should expose criminal forces and pressure groups that have been lying low and have not been exposed and clamp down on them .  
With regard to the leading cadres and state organ personnel who exercised ineffective leadership in the special work to put things to rights , neglected their duties , or engaged in embezzlement must be sternly investigated and dealt with by the supervisory departments , and those who committed crime should be investigated to affix their criminal responsibility in accordance with the law .

In recent years , the nation has launched ad hoc campaigns to crack down on smuggling , tax evasion , tax fraud , foreign exchange fraud , production and sale of counterfeit and shoddy goods , and other illegal criminal activities .  These have achieved remarkable success and have played an important role in promoting the healthy development of the socialist market economy .  
For those regions where the rectification work is slack , market economic order is chaotic , and efforts to improve the situation have proved ineffective after a long period of time , those local government officials who are primarily responsible as well as relevant responsible persons must be held accountable in accordance with laws and disciplinary rules ; those who have committed crimes must be investigated on criminal grounds in accordance with the law .  
The meeting maintained that the Criminal Law amended at the Fifth Session of the Eighth National People 's Congress on 14 March 1997 made definite stipulations on punishing the criminal acts of destroying forest resources such as felling trees unlawfully , or cutting down woods and other forest trees without discrimination , which has played an important role in protecting forest resources and deterring criminal activities .

Since a national conference on social order work concluded , leaders at all levels have taken immediate action to mobilize people at all levels , make specific arrangements , muster and organize manpower , and set off an upsurge for our " strike hard " struggle with heavy fists and with an eye on rectifying social order .

They investigated to check if some large , key cases , and political and legal agencies followed the law in arresting criminal elements engaged in fraud .  Corrupt elements in party and political agencies and law enforcement departments with ties to criminal elements on the outside were also uncovered .  
In this struggle against fraudulent claims for export tax rebates , all levels of government and relevant departments worked together , coordinating their steps and removing obstacles and interferences , combining forces to investigate large and key cases .  Regardless of what units or what persons were involved , all cases were investigated thoroughly , giving the perpetrators of fraudulent tax rebates no room to breathe , curbing the arrogance of criminal gangs , and recovering huge economic losses for the nation .  
After reviewing these cases , the Supreme People 's Court maintained that Huang Zhenchi , Lin Sucun , Huang Wenlong , and He Tao were found guilty of forging VAT receipts for unlawful benefits ; and that the receipts used for defrauding tax rebates involved inordinate amounts of money .  It said the lawbreakers must be harshly punished because their criminal offenses were particularly serious and the losses they had incurred to the state were huge .  
Accompanied by Hubei Governor Zhang Guoguang and other comrades , Luo Gan conducted investigation and study of the progress of the struggle to strike hard and put things in order from 11 to 15 May .

Li Peng stressed at the symposium : At present , juvenile delinquency has taken an upward trend in China ; and juvenile crimes tend to be committed at an increasingly younger age and by those criminal means that are generally employed by adults .  All this should be brought to the close attention of the entire society .  
Things are greatly different in the modern society ; however , judging from the vicious criminal cases committed by juveniles in recent years , we can see that a major factor leading to the situation lies with the education of families and schools , lies with the impractical mentality of parents who " hope their children to become dragons one day " as well as their way to " push their children to become dragons , " and lies with our stress on an exam-oriented education in the past instead of a quality education .  
Narcotics not only seriously corrode a person 's soul and make the drug addict psychopathic , distorted in personality , and lose his self-respect or even morals , but also has induced a lot of illegal and criminal activities and given rise to a lot of social evils such as the " supporting of narcotic consumption by stealing , snatching , prostitution , gambling , and drug trafficking . "  
Anti-narcotics law enforcement departments have always maintained a high-pressure posture of striking hard at narcotics-related illegal and criminal activities and persisted in rehabilitating every single drug addict , punishing every single drug trafficker , rooting out every single narcotic plant grown , and investigating and affixing the responsibility for every single case of narcotics production .

People remember that at the beginning of the founding of New China , the central government immediately took rigorous measures to launch a nationwide anti-narcotics campaign .

However , since the international community has failed to launch a forceful crackdown on organized international criminal gangs owing to the loopholes in the laws of certain countries , such as " political asylum " and " respect for human rights , " the activities of illegal migration have been revived like dying cinders glowing again and have persisted despite repeated prohibitions , thus doing tremendous harm to the society .  
When handling cases and problems , political and law organs are urged to enhance consciousness in the comprehensive management of public order , and while cracking down on law-breaking and on criminal activities , to consider problems from the angle of crime prevention , to search for reasons for criminal activity and to discover loopholes in the law through the handling of cases , to put forward preventive measures , to help relevant departments improve management system , strengthen education on the legal system , and implement preventive measures .

With regard to the recent tragic incident of illegal immigration , we also have had a common stand .  China is resolutely opposed to illegal immigration and has formulated strict laws and adopted stern measures to prevent it .  However , trans-national criminal gangs are rampant and very fraudulent .  
The Chinese Government , acting in accordance with the law , outlawed the " Falungong " cult and harshly censured the criminal elements that broke the law .  Especially after the local authorities ' deep-going and meticulous ideological education and enlightening efforts , the overwhelming majority of " Falungong " exercisers sobered up and awakened .  
Under the complicated struggles , officers and men of the judicial organs and armed police have taken a firm and clear-cut stand , forcefully attacked the national splittist forces and terrorist and violent criminal activities , and maintained stability of the overall social and political situation .

Zhu Rongji said that last year , we resolutely implemented the decision by the party Central Committee , dealt destructive blows at some criminal smuggling gangs , and obtained important results .  Politically , this showed the image of " opposing corruption and cracking down on crimes , and strictly enforcing law " of the party and the government .  Economically , smuggling cases involving nearly 80 billion yuan were cracked and the revenue from tariffs increased by more than 71 billion yuan over the previous year .  
Zhu Rongji pointed out that according to the experience in cracking down on smuggling last year , without improving and using advanced technical means and modern information technology , it is impossible to effectively crack down on the cunning criminal gangs and safeguard the economic legal system and national interests .  Therefore , at present , we must seize the time to improve the " golden customs project " and the " golden taxation project . "  
Through handling and reviewing criminal appeal cases , we are likely not only to strengthen our procuratorial organs ' capability of correcting mistakes on their own and ensure both strict and fair law enforcement on the part of our procuratorial organs but also to reverse some erroneous verdicts , rulings , or decisions ; exercise legal supervision over the judicial activities of some other organs ; and safeguard judicial justice in an effective way .  
Confusing right and wrong , some policemen harbored criminal offenders and were even indulgent with criminals .  Some policemen even served as protective umbrellas for evildoers and some directly engaged in smuggling and shielded smugglers ; as a result , the evil phenomena of pornography , gambling , and drugs still survive despite repeated crackdowns .  
It is necessary to protect the legal rights of the floating population , severely crack down on various criminals who are unworthily registered as members of the floating population , and establish a sound system of assistance provided for investigation by clues and tip-offs .  It is necessary to organize and develop a special struggle to trace and arrest fugitives by acting according to circumstances , and crack down hand in hand on cross-regional criminal activities .  
The State Administration of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Public Security recently issued a circular .  The circular points out : The criminal activities of producing and selling fake and shoddy commodities are very rampant at present , as law-breakers have resorted to all sorts of means to openly hinder , resist , and interfere in administrative law-enforcement in order to gain staggering profits .  
Because the profits gained through smuggling of illegal immigrants are equivalent to or exceed the huge profits gained through drug trafficking activities , with annual profits reaching more than $ 1 billion , international criminal cliques have spared no efforts to rush into the danger . 
Through initial investigations , it is believed that the [ incident of ] illegal immigrants hiding inside the container discovered by Hong Kong authorities this time was arranged by international criminal cliques .  They first went to Guangzhou from Fujian , then they entered Hong Kong in groups with round trip permits .  
Under such circumstances , international criminal cliques have adopted more concealed and roundabout smuggling tactics .  For example , the illegal immigrants captured by Hong Kong this time were arranged by criminals in Hong Kong . They falsely reported the material inside the containers .  
Zhu Rongji pointed out : The problems such as illegal immigration , sneaky intrusion into other countries , and so on exist in many countries , which is the transnational crime committed by international criminal groups and must be cracked down on with joint efforts .  
The State Council has recently decided to set up a National Small Group for the Coordination of Fighting Production of Fake Items in order to severely attack the criminal offense of production and sale of counterfeit goods and effectively organize a unified national operation to crack down on fake goods .

The correct implementation of the criminal procedural law has played a positive role in safeguarding the rights and interests of citizens , dealing blows to criminal offenses , maintaining social stability , safeguarding the smooth implementation of economic construction , and administering the country in line with law .  
Jia Chunwang also emphatically pointed out : Chinese public security organs should resolutely crack down on sabotages schemed by Western hostile forces and elements ; resolutely crack down on illegal and criminal activities schemed by national separatists , violent terrorists , and religious forces ; and resolutely ban " Falungong " and other illegal cults and harshly crack down on their illegal and criminal activities according to law .

Due to the close cooperation and coordination , various politics and law departments have severely cracked down on sabotage by hostile forces according to the law , timely handled and cracked down on the illegal and criminal activities of the cultic Falungong organization , and educated and transformed a number of Falungong criminal elements .  
The public information network supervision departments , which have been established by the provincial public security systems nationwide , recently held a meeting , summing up their work results over the past year .

Internet police of the supervision centers in Guangdong , Fujian , Sichuan , and other places have successfully discovered many criminal cases from e-mails .  
Although the forms of expression and the numbers of people involved in criminal and evil forces vary between the coastal areas and the interior and between town and country , and some organizations are lax and some tight , their antisocial essence is completely identical and they do very great social harm .  
After illegally acquiring great wealth , the bosses of some criminal syndicate-style organizations suddenly change their identity by setting up companies , running factories , and acting as managers and bosses , protecting and nourishing their business through criminal activities , and doing everything possible to rope in and corrupt party , government , and judicial cadres and engage in graft in a big way so as to seek " protective umbrellas . "  
The crimes of criminal and evil forces of all kinds have already done serious damage to the stability of social order , seriously threatened the safety of the masses ' lives and property , seriously damaged order in socialist market economy and in social management , corrupted the party , government , and judicial cadre force , eroded grassroots political power , and ruined the party style and social mood .  
With regard to the current serious state of activities committed by criminal and evil forces , the leading central comrades have given important instructions on many occasions specifically demanding that the public security organs crack down severely according to law to totally eliminate the evil ;  
As important instruments of the people 's democratic dictatorship , it is the sacred duty of the public security organs to crack down hard on the crimes of criminal and evil forces , ensure the smooth progress of reforms , opening up , and economic construction , and ensure that the masses can live and work in peace .  
Since Henan Province police developed great strength and impetus in their anti-crime special struggle , they have destroyed a total of 800 vicious criminal gangs that had Mafia qualities , and unearthed many important cases that had caused serious damage and were a terrible influence , and they have blocked the vicious criminal force from spreading .  
To assure the actual result of the anti-crime special struggle , the public security bureau of Henan Province made sure that 100 criminal gangs with Mafia qualities , vicious force , and hegemony and 20 severe criminal cases have registered supervision and are being followed and guided , supervised during the whole progress , and being recorded for every case to keep track and to close the cases as soon as possible .  
In those places , departments , and units where major criminal cases , public security problems and disasters , and social unrest have occurred , an investigation must be conducted to determine relevant leaders ' party disciplinary , administrative disciplinary , and legal liabilities .  It is necessary to exercise one-vote veto authority .  We must never allow criminals to go unpunished .  
For some time now , certain lawless elements have vigorously engaged in manufacturing and selling counterfeit and inferior goods and fraudulently obtaining export tax rebates , for the sake of reaping vast profits ; and some have banded together to form harmful syndicate-style criminal organizations .  
The meeting called on public security organs at all levels to act in line with the central authorities ' plans , actively participate in the joint operations to deal strict blows to criminal activities of manufacturing and selling fake and inferior commodities , and the special struggle to deal strict blows to the fraud of export tax rebates , evasion and cheating in foreign exchange payments , and other criminal activities .  
To obtain windfall profits , some criminal elements build connections with leading cadres in various ways and corrupt them by bribing them with a large amount of money or through providing them with sexual services .  Over-concentration of power in some cadres , a lack of transparency in the exercise of power as well as a lack of an effective oversight and check system against abuse of powers give rise to corruption like the exchange of power for money .  In addition , because of the state 's limited financial power , public servants ' pay is low .  
In improving the order of market the economy and developing the functions of customs , we should mainly launch incessant struggles against smuggling , work in coordination with concerned departments to crack down on tax rebate fraud , illegal remittance and procurement of foreign exchange and other criminal activities .  We should standardize various operations related to imports and exports , and maintain normal order in imports and exports .  
In order to preserve social stability and tranquillity and protect basic human rights and freedoms , the Chinese Government has banned the " Falungong " organization and punished according to law a very small number of lawless and criminal elements ; and it has carried out thorough and meticulous work to educate and convert the great majority of those who were led astray , to enable them to return to a normal life .  
He asked various units to work in close coordination , give full play to the advantage of joint struggle of all public security organizations , consider the work of tracing and arresting criminal suspects as a special task , make overall and proper arrangements , and strive to achieve practical results .  
The special struggle arranged by the Ministry of Public Security against criminal syndicates and evil forces has produced initial success ; we must unremittingly pay close attention to it to completely root out criminal syndicates and evil forces in all localities .  In particular , we must resolutely crack down on their " protective umbrellas " and severely punish according to law whoever is involved .  
The special police contingent of the criminal police corps of the Beijing municipal public security bureau is a specialized force formed in view of Beijing 's development into an international metropolis .  
While inspecting the contingent 's vehicles and other equipment , Luo Gan said : In cracking criminal cases , the public security people 's police usually faces extremely cruel criminals ; therefore , our criminal and special police forces should be very competent and skillful and well equipped in order to ensure that the enemy is most forcefully dealt with and they themselves are most effectively protected .  
Wang Ming , vice president of the Beijing Higher People 's Court and senior judge who has been engaging in criminal judicial work for a long time , pointed out : After the state banned " Falungong " heretic cult organizations in line with the law , Li Hongzhi and his " Falungong " heretical cult organizations have continued to openly publicize false reasoning and fallacies to defile the government and slander against other people .  These acts have violated China 's Constitution and relevant provisions of the law and are evidently harmful to society .  
Some experts and scholars in the scientific and technological circles of the capital city recently held a special symposium .  Experts and scholars attending the meeting expressed great indignation against the criminal activity of the evil " Falungong " cult by misleading and instigating some obsessed " Falungong " practitioners under its mental control to commit suicide by setting fire on themselves .  
Participating jurists pointed out that Li Hongzhi and his evil " Falungong " cult were the plotters and instigators of the case in which a number of stubborn " Falungong " members set themselves on fire at Tienanmen Square . By doing so these " Falungong " members did themselves bodily harm , abused human rights , and seriously broke China 's criminal law .  It is necessary to crack down on these people according to law to guard the authority and sanctity of the law and to maintain political stability and unity .  
She Mengiao , secretary of the party group and executive vice chairman of the China Law Society , called at the meeting on jurists and lawyers around the country to gain a complete understanding of the evil nature of " Falungong " and make full use of the legal weapons in their hands to crack down on criminal activities carried out by the " Falungong " cult organization and educate and redeem stubborn " Falungong " members so as to remove the social cancer , making their due contributions .  
We should further intensify comprehensive management of public order , crack down hard on various criminal activities in accordance with the law , and wage a special struggle against " triads and evil forces , " with the focus on homicide , explosion , and gun-related grave violence crimes and gang crimes , as well as serious economic crimes .  
Leading cadres at all levels must " stress politics " in their day-to-day work , hold firm on cardinal questions of right and wrong , and resolutely wage a solemn struggle against the unlawful and criminal acts of the " Falungong " cult , in order to safeguard the excellent situation marked by stability and unity .  
As disclosed , the reason why the Shenyang people 's deputies were dissatisfied with the city court and city procuratorate 's reports was that this city has in recent years seen a series of shocking cases - - including party and government officials ' corruption cases , major cases involving criminal syndicates , and shooting cases - - some of which even bothered Zhongnanhai and required the central authorities ' direct intervention in the investigation and handling .  
Talking about the relationship between handling Falungong and guaranteeing human rights , Liu said : The policy of the Chinese government in handling the Falungong problem is to unite with , educate , and saving most of the practitioners who have been deceived .  The Chinese government has punished a small handful of people in the Falungong cult because they have engaged in illegal and criminal activities , disrupted public order , and violated the Chinese law .  
As vice minister of public security and deputy head of the national leading group for cracking down on smuggling , Li Jizhou assumed the important responsibility of struggling against smuggling and other criminal activities .  However , he abused his authority , sought personal benefits , and seriously obstructed public security organs ' normal law enforcement activities .  The gravity of his discipline - and law-breaking act has seriously damaged the party and government 's prestige among the masses and resulted in bad political and social influence .  
According to the Public Security organs ' preliminary investigation , this incident of self-immolation was totally the result of Li Hongzhi 's poisoning , confusion , instigation , and mental manipulation of " Falungong " fanatics , and it was an organized , premeditated , and planned criminal activity undertaken with measured steps .  
Meanwhile , the legal system with Chinese characteristics that constitutes seven legal categories - - the constitution and constitution-related laws , civil law and commercial law , administrative law , economic law , social law , criminal law , as well as law of procedure and law of extra-judicial procedure - - is rather complete .  Most of the basic and major laws in each legal category have been enacted .  
Han Zhubin said : Procuratorial organs at various levels consistently focused on the investigation and handling of important cases of crime committed by cadres ranking at and above the county or provincial section level and major criminal cases involving large sums of money , causing great harm , and having a high profile .  In total , they placed on file for investigation 18,086 cases of grafting and bribes taking amounting to 50,000 yuan and over .  Among them , there were 1,335 exceptionally large cases involving over 1 million yuan each .  
In view of the fact that the number of suspects of corruption , bribery , and misappropriation of public funds absconding with huge sums of money had increased in recent years , at the end of last year , the SPP and the Ministry of Public Security jointly organized a dedicated campaign for tracking down fugitives .  So far , nearly 300 suspects at large involved in major criminal corruption and bribery cases have fallen into the net of justice .  
In close coordination with relevant departments , procuratorial organs upheld the principle of " cracking down on crimes , " and meted out punishment according to the law to the offenders of serious crimes that had endangered the country 's state security , economic security , and social order , Han Zhubin indicated .  During the past year , a total of 715,333 criminal suspects were arrested , among whom 708,836 were prosecuted by the state .  
In the development of western China , procuratorial organs in western China prosecuted more than 300 cases relevant to crimes committed in handling key construction projects , ravaging the ecological environment , and mismanaging money and goods meant for people stricken by poverty and natural disasters ; and authorized the arrest of 3,891 criminal suspects who destroyed communications , energy , or telecommunications infrastructure or ravaged the ecological environment .  
The people 's courts have carefully heard criminal cases of organizing and using the " Falungong " cult to sabotage the implementation of laws , cause deaths , gather crowds to disrupt social order , print illegal publications , conduct and spread cult propaganda , and so on , in strict accordance with the criminal law and applicable judicial interpretations .  
This year , the procuratorial organizations will emphasize the supervision of investigation and prosecution , detection , hearing , and execution of punishment in criminal cases , and also the supervision of trial of civil and administrative cases .  Stress will be laid on preventing job related crimes in coordination with financial , securities , customs , medical and pharmaceutical , building and other trades .  
According to report by reporter Zhang Jingyong from the meeting of the education group , in their discussions , the committee members held that last year , the Supreme People 's Court and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate strictly performed their judicial and prosecuting functions , severely punished various types of criminal offenders on the basis of laws , protected the legitimate interests of the masses , and played an important role in maintaining social stability .  
In the new year , the Supreme People 's Court and the Supreme People 's Procuratorate should orient their work to the general tasks of the party and the state , aim at maintaining social stability and promoting economic construction , persistently uphold judicial fairness , harshly punish criminal offenders and corrupt elements , and provide effective judicial guarantees and legal services for reform , opening up , and the development of the socialist market economy .  
Deputy Ping Ziliang , who is a professor of Inner Mongolia Teachers ' University , said : Last year , through dealing harsh blows at various types of serious criminal offenders , the judicial and procuratorial organs played a great role in guaranteeing that the people could live and work in a peaceful and safe environment , and at the same time , they also provided a good preconditions and guarantee for economic development .  
Though being a typical criminal case in nature , the incident has laid bare serious problems in school management as well , such as people without fixed duties in the society being allowed to enter a school as they please , the absence of a strong sense of security or prevention in schools , and the failure to enforce forceful protection measures or tight security in schools .  
The notice stated : Since the explosion incident broke out in the school on 6 March , the public security departments have carried out thorough-going investigations ; gathered evidence ; defined the incident as a typical criminal case ;  
Apart from the above , more efforts should be devoted to improving the public order by taking comprehensive measures , punishing by law all kinds of criminal activities that endanger our social and national security , and banning " Falungong " and other evil cults in accordance with law so as to further ensure our social stability .  
Legal circles have different methods for demarcating the legal departments , and the Standing Committee will initially divide the socialist legal system with Chinese characteristics into seven legal departments in line with the actual requirements of legislative work ; these departments are the constitution and related laws , civil and commercial law , administrative law , economic law , social law , criminal law , and procedural and non-procedural law .

These include the dissemination of quarterly Prosecutions Division Bulletins , regular meetings with Section Heads of the specialists units in the Division , compilation of resource / reference materials and registries , more links with local and overseas professional legal bodies as well as private lawyers , appointment of policy co-ordinators to deal specifically with criminal law and prosecution policy reform , and wider distribution of the Criminal Appeals Bulletin produced by the Prosecutions Division monthly .  
Speaking at a welcoming ceremony hosted by BDB , Mr Ng said that the co-operation between the Police of both sides in combating cross-boundary crimes was necessary as the two places were adjacent to each other and social and economic contacts were frequent .  " Sharing experience and the exchange of intelligence are vital to intercept Vietnamese boat people and cracking down on smuggling , illegal immigration and criminal activities at sea , " Mr Ng said .  
While fully committed to developing in-house expertise in criminal proceedings , Mr Cross also noted the importance of promoting a strong , experienced and independent Bar , " we remain wedded to the belief that there are legitimate public interest reasons why some prosecution work should be briefed out to the private sector , " he said .  
* granting the court a discretion to direct that the question of admissibility be dealt with in the presence of the jury , coupled with a lowering of the standard of proof for determining voluntariness to that of civil proceedings ( on " a balance of probabilities " ) , rather than the existing criminal standard ( " beyond reasonable doubt " ) .  
Mr Stoker said that the Commission has reached no firm view as to which of these options should be pursued , and was seeking the views of the public .  He said that while the Commission invited comment principally on the specific options for procedural reform identified in the consultation paper , it would also welcome thoughts on other means of improving the present procedure in jury trials for determining the admissibility of confession statements in criminal cases .  
My own department 's efforts to facilitate the increased use of Chinese in the law have continued . 32 seminars , mock trials and workshops relating to bilingual advocacy were organised during 1998 ; a Bilingual Legal Documents Unit was established in the Civil Division of my department ; the Bilingual Court Documents Unit continues to translate materials for use in criminal proceedings ; the third edition of the English-Chinese Glossary of Legal Terms has been published ; and preparation of the first edition of a Chinese-English Glossary is underway . 
As a high standard of proof is required for " criminal offences " , it is often more difficult to convict complicated commercial crimes and takes a great deal of resources and time to establish a case .  As such , the criminal approach to deal with market misconduct may not necessarily have a stronger deferent effect on committed offenders .  
" Any person failing to comply with a statutory order without reasonable excuse is guilty of a criminal offence under the Buildings Ordinance and may be prosecuted in Court . The maximum penalty is one year imprisonment and a fine of $ 50,000 plus a daily fine of $ 5,000 , " he said .  
Apart from incorporating systematically a lot of the existing separate criminal regulations and subsidiary provisions into the new Criminal Law , certain concepts have been reformed , including the incorporation of the principle of " everyone is equal before the law " , abolition of the system of " analogy " , adoption of the system of " crime and punishment being prescribed by law " , substitution of the controversial " crime of counter-revolution " with a more clearly-defined " crime of endangering national security " .  
Today 's legal aid system has grown to one which covers all criminal cases and a wide range of civil cases including matrimonial disputes , personal injuries claims , employment disputes , contractual disputes , to name a few . 
Today 's legal aid system has grown to one which covers all criminal cases and a wide range of civil cases including matrimonial disputes , personal injuries claims , employment disputes , contractual disputes , to name but a few .  
In that short period , many crucial legal issues have been addressed .  These include the status of the Provisional Legislative Council , the adaptation of laws programme , the criminal jurisdiction of Mainland courts over cross-boundary activities , the right of abode issue , and the constitutionality of laws protecting the national and regional flags .  
As an alternative to the civil proceedings before the MMT , the Bill preserves and expands the existing criminal route for dealing with market misconduct activities , to be resorted to when there is sufficient evidence to meet the criminal standard and it is in the public interest to bring prosecution before the courts .  
In the foreword of the Hong Kong Police Review 1999 , which was published today ( May 21 ) , Mr Hui noted that the continuing climate of economic uncertainty and social hardship resulting from the Asian financial crisis had an inevitable effect on both the number and types of crimes committed , with continued evidence of increased crime related to the downturn in the economy , including cases of criminal intimidation related to debt-collecting malpractices and quick-cash crimes such as pick-pocketing and snatching . 
" There have still been wild stories flying around in the international media that Hong Kong 's economic autonomy has been greatly eroded , that the Beijing Government is interfering in Hong Kong 's administration , that Hong Kong is the base of diversion for the PLA to smuggle controlled items into China and that Chinese owned firms in Hong Kong escape prosecution for gross criminal acts .  
" We aim to achieve our vision of international recognition of excellence as an integral part of the Hong Kong criminal justice system , through efforts in achieving value for money , public confidence , staff morale and public safety in the provision of quality custodial care and comprehensive rehabilitation programmes compatible with human dignity . "  
Following extensive investigations into complaints received in June this year against criminal intimidation and blackmail perpetrated by suspected triad personalities connected with a loan sharking syndicate , officers from the Mong Kok district crime headquarters conducted an undercover operation and raided various commercial and residential premises in the territory today .  
As an increased deterrent and to punish market misconduct , the Bill will retain , modernize and expand the existing criminal regime to deal with market misconduct where there is sufficient evidence that a criminal offence has been committed by an identifiable person , that there is a reasonable prospect of a conviction , and that it is in the public interest to bring a prosecution .  
In November last year , a first group of anglophone counsel from my department attended an excellent English language course in Mainland law at Peking University . The course included lectures on the legal system and government structure in the Mainland , and on the latest developments in constitutional , criminal , civil and administrative law .  
BL 48 gives a detailed account of the manifold functions of the CE . He is responsible for leading the government of the Region , signing bills and promulgating laws , signing budgets and issuing executive orders .  He has the power to appoint and remove judges , and report to the CPG for appointment and removal of principal officials .  He can pardon persons convicted of criminal offences or commute their penalties , and on behalf of the HKSAR , conduct external affairs as authorized by the CPG .  
Mr Tsang said the Force had established and maintained a clear strategy for ensuring safety and stability , mostly through a strong uniformed presence on the streets , effective and immediate response to all incidents , professional training of personnel and use of modern equipment , thorough investigations of all crime reports , development and maintenance of an effective criminal intelligence network , and comprehensive crime prevention programmes in all frontline Police Districts . 
To achieve this goal , the Administration needs not only day-to-day co-operation at the operational level , but also a durable and rules-based framework for co-operation in the administration of criminal justice .  This includes the establishment of a statutory framework for the rendition of fugitive offenders , the transfer of sentenced prisoners and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters .  
To achieve this goal , we need not only day-to-day co-operation at the operational level , but also a durable and rules-based framework for co-operation in the administration of criminal justice .  This includes the establishment of a statutory framework for the rendition of fugitive offenders , the transfer of sentenced prisoners and mutual legal assistance in criminal matters .  
The crime cases involving human life are almost part of everyday 's news .  In solving a crime case , witnesses are , of course , crucial .  Besides , the dead body itself can also reveal critical physical evidence such as cause of death , sequence of events surrounding the death , and persons involving in the crime case .  Forensic science is what we call today to scientifically collect physical evidence of a crime for criminal detection .  
Behind this internationally accepted definition is the consensus that there is a qualitative difference between terrorist acts capable of inflicting massive and indiscriminate injury and damage to the public and ordinary criminal activities , such as criminal damage , assault or even murder . 
Factors that are taken into account include the nature and gravity of the criminal or disciplinary offence laid against the officer ; possibility of the same offence recurring if the officer remains in office ; availability of suitable posts for re-deploying the officer ; and likely public perception .  We interdict an officer only when re-deployment to alternative duties is not possible or inappropriate .  
" When the Commissioner took up office in January 2001 , he directed that the Force focus on the maintenance of a strong visible uniform presence on our streets , provide a fast effective response to emergencies , strengthen the Force criminal intelligence system , enlist public assistance in fighting crime as well as further enhancing our liaison with Mainland and overseas law enforcement authorities to combat cross-border crime . "

The VCD comprises 12 short episodes , each lasting about three minutes , and features crimes such as triad activities at schools , trafficking in dangerous drugs , selling pirated goods , internet related crimes , common assault , shoplifting , criminal damage , indecent assault and sexual intercourse with underage girl .  
Mr Lo said : " The earlier conflicts of interests in Yuen Long have led to a series of violent acts by the two triad societies including wounding , criminal damage and arson which seriously endangered the life of the residents .  Thus , the Police planned an operation targeting the illicit activities of these two triad gangs and implemented the operation codenamed Mullington in late June with a view to dealing a blow on the gangs . "  
Exercise of these powers should normally be confined to fires of doubtful or suspicious origin , i.e . fires suspected to have been caused by arson or to have involved any other criminal offence , or the cause of which can not be determined after initial investigation .  
Under our proposals , which are based on the existing law , ' protected information ' only includes five tightly defined categories of information relating to : ( i ) security and intelligence ; ( ii ) defence ; ( iii ) international relations ; ( iv ) relations between the Central Authorities of the PRC and Hong Kong ; and ( v ) the commission of offences and criminal investigations .  
We have therefore decided to define the relevant activities more precisely to mean " illegal access " of protected information , which would only mean specified criminal acts , that is unauthorized access to computer by telecommunication , access to computer with criminal or dishonest intent , theft , robbery , burglary or bribery .  
Should the ISSOs be the subject matter of legal proceedings decisive of an individual 's civil rights and obligations or criminal liability , the content of the relevant Orders will be the subject of argument and interpretation in a public hearing and published in a judgment made public , as required by Article 10 of the Hong Kong Bill or Rights Ordinance , Cap . 383 which implements Article 14 ( 1 ) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights .  
Apart from " quick cash crime " , Mr Chau noted that the other major crime category that had registered an increase in the first half of this year was " anti-social crime " such as serious assault , assaulting police , criminal intimidation , arson , resisting arrest , criminal damage , and disorderly / fighting in public place .  
The motive force behind progress is the pursuit of wealth . But even if people are well off , if they lack viable moral standards , then unrest and criminal behavior may arise . So we must set up a stable , ethical , harmonious society in which wealth is evenly distributed .  
If all goes well with the experiment , the lay assessor 's court can be fully effected without serious problem . ( 2 ) It was also decided the types of written court verdicts should be simplified , and that besides looking into such simplification during amendment of the civil and criminal laws , the Compulsory Execution Law could be amended to give executing authorities the right to consult tax records to avoid hiding of property or false claims of debt .  
Big stock players , wealthy businessmen , and the owners of construction firms - - the " highrisk groups " that are prime targets for criminal attacks - - have become apprehensive and fearful , hiring security teams to protect their homes and bodyguards when they go out and even giving up their imported limos for inconspicuous domestic sedans .  
That is to say , the younger those who have been arrested and imprisoned are at the first offense , the more likely is the possibility they will be repeat or serious offenders later . This is because on the inside not only are they able to learn even more " specialized " criminal techniques , after they get out , because they have been " labelled " as bad guys , it is difficult to go straight .  
The civil officials judge the good and the bad - - the military carry out the punishment ; ox-headed and horse-faced demon messengers from purgatory detain the criminal and the gold and silver generals put him or her in a cangue ; the white messenger of death turns his eyes up fiercely and sticks out his tongue , while the black messenger carries the arrest warrant . You can not help but tremble in such a sinister atmosphere .  
For someone who has never before been in con tact with drug addicts , the stereotype is closely connected to that of criminal society , with large dark eyebrows over brooding , threatening eyes leading into a violent , powder keg personality . Little did we expect that when we got to the rehabilitation center we would find that the patients were no different from the run-of-the-mill .  
Loopholes in the law " The Voice of Taiwan " violated criminal laws , was investigated by the prosecutor 's office which found sufficient evidence to act , and then was closed down for its unlawful behavior . Meanwhile , the " Green Peace Taiwan Cultural Broadcasting Station " and " Taiwan News Transfer " have not been set up in accord with legal procedures . They should have applied to set up , and by not doing so they have violated their responsibilities under the Broadcasting Law . These are two different situations .  
Tsai says that the song was written about a friend of his who was imprisoned for being in a criminal gang . The friend had applied for leave from prison to visit his sick grandmother . When he was refused , he escaped from jail . When he was discovered and reincarcerated , his sentence was raised from five to 12 years .  
Traditional Chinese placed great emphasis on proper rituals or patterns of behavior , and failure to observe these was deemed to be criminal . For example , these days a lack of filial piety is considered to be a personal moral problem , in which outsiders should not get too involved . But in the past it was a serious offense . Not only could the individual be punished through the state legal system , family law was even more rigorous and inescapable , and violators were expelled from the clan .  
As the harmful effects of drugs came to be understood , drug trafficking changed from being legal to being a criminal offense around the world . There has been a significant trend toward international cooperation in fighting the drug trade . Producer , transshipment , and consumer nations have joined hands to clamp down at every link in the chain . Only in this way can narcotics activities be completely rooted out .  
Minister of Justice Liao , fully engaged in the campaign to crack down on illegal behavior in all areas of life , suggests that the Sung case shows the serious extent of the penetration of religious groups by criminal gangs ; this has already become part of his professional territory . Taipei City Mayor Chen Shui-bian also announced a crackdown on criminally connected shrines to begin on October 15 .  
Lin feels that this is the unfair result of women 's Catch-22 position in society . At any rate , Lin believes that buddying around with the police , having a broad set of personal connections , and being familiar with a lot of bizarre criminal tactics are n't really directly relevant to whether or not a person can direct a case .  
Kan adds an even more ridiculous case of how hard it has been to change men 's attitudes . In ROC criminal law , rape is defined as a " crime damaging to social morality . " In other words , according to the legal interpretation , the real evil in rape is that it offends the requirement for women to remain chaste and virtuous . As for the woman , it seems that the violation of her person is secondary !  
To avoid seeing all responsibility pushed onto " a small number of bad guys , " feminists often draw attention to structural factors : women made into sex objects in TV ads , the highpriced bargirl culture where businessmen socialize , paternalistic family structures that place higher value on men than women . They point to all the " repressive " behaviors that are a builtin part of daily life , arguing that these are the true roots of rampant sexual criminal behavior .  
The Academia Sinica 's Chiao Hsingkai notes that it is often overlooked that both sexual harassment and rape are repeat offenses . If undiscovered , over a long period an offender may repeatedly play his degrading games . As for how he chooses his victims , that is still uncertain . However , it is often the case that the criminal will pick the easiestlooking target : young , unsophisticated , genteel looking girls .  
For instance , in the Four Pillars case , if the firm is found guilty , there will be criminal fines ( under the EEA , the maximum fine is US $ 5 million ) , as well as possible compensation in the civil suit . One can imagine a scenario in which all the profits for encroaching on intellectual rights over these past few years will enter the coffers of the American government and the original manufacturer , meaning that the efforts of the copying firms were all for other people 's gain .  
On October 13 , police in Hsinchu County 's Chutung Precinct broke a shocking criminal case involving youths-thirteen teenagers , both male and female , had confined a 14-year old girl to a room , beaten her to death , and then buried her body .  
Twenty years ago , people watched Taiwan 's Little League teams fighting for glory abroad on late night TV . A few days ago , people stayed up all night watching a live marathon program , directed by and starring a major criminal . Then came the elections for county and city executives . After the excitement generated by political " stars , " the victory of the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) has rewritten the political map of Taiwan .  
Old hunting grounds have been claimed by the state , with every tree and blade of grass strictly protected . With heavy punishments imposed from above , and the attraction of external economic opportunities , the social status of hunters has dropped precipitously , from an honored class to a virtually criminal class .  
Some years ago , Mai Jan-mei was director of guidance at another Taipei middle school , located in one of the city 's most infamous criminal areas . At that time some pupils formed a gang and began causing trouble . They padded their left shoulders up high and went around the school terrorizing the other children ; even teachers did n't dare mess with them .  
Fa Chih-pin , a professor of law at Chengchih University , points out that early on most countries included slander and libel in criminal law . After World War II , with strengthened calls from international organizations to protect human rights , the problems of finding people guilty for slander and libel under criminal law gradually began to become apparent . " The major difference between criminal and civil law is that people can be locked up under criminal law , and when people are in jail they clearly do n't have freedom to speak and publish . "  
For instance , Chen Chih-hsiang , a judge in the criminal division of the Taipei District Court , has petitioned for three constitutional interpretations : one on whether third-time drug abuse offenders should be subject to mandatory life imprisonment or death ; another on whether the scope for compensation under the Regulations on Applications for the Restitution of Citizens ' Rights Violated Under Martial Law was too narrowly defined and the requirements for documentary evidence too rigorous ; and a third on whether mandatory life imprisonment or death for drug traffickers was unconstitutional .  
In late 1997 , in response to the general sense of powerlessness throughout society that year following three major criminal cases , an epidemic of porcine foot and mouth disease and the Asian financial crisis , Huang Wu-hsiung again wrote an article putting forward the idea of community colleges . In it he stated : " The aim is not only to provide the public with lifelong opportunities for education , but also to revitalize Taiwanese society through knowledge and discussion , the operation of civic groups and the exchange of skills . "  
After joining the faculty at New Haven University , Li used the university 's chemical analysis laboratory to help the police investigate criminal cases on numerous occasions . In 1979 , the Connecticut state police hired Li outright as their senior forensics expert , and he then rose through a number of positions to become the head of the entire Connecticut state police force in July , 1989 .  
The importance of the human factor can not be overlooked . No matter how sophisticated forensic techniques are , and no matter how advanced scientific instruments may become , the key to success will always be how well the practitioner makes use of his tools . The core elements of scientific criminal investigation are broad knowledge , finely honed powers of observation , and a combination of bold imagination and cautious search for proof .  
On October 16 , Justice Minister Yeh Chin-fong convened a conference of senior police officers , public prosecutors and government anti-corruption units from the six county and city administrations of central Taiwan . They decided to closely monitor the borrowing of architect licenses and the involvement of mafia in public construction projects , so as to prevent corruption among civil servants . They agreed to impose severe penalties for criminal activities relating to reconstruction projects .  
From the " Nine Chapters " of the esteemed Han minister of state Xiao He-which covered , among other things , lawsuits , standards for arrest , and criminal punishments for robbery and theft-to the later marriage laws , there were 906 volumes under more than 60 separate legal headings . If you add to this supplementary sources of law , like precedents and debates by legal scholars , then the Han code could handle everything that is covered by both statute and customary law in the modern world .  
Internally , there are a number of worrying problems - " black gold politics " ( the confluence of criminal gangs , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians ) , rising crime , and only erratic environmental consciousness . It is urgent to achieve consensus on these problems in order to find solutions .  
On May 24 , Premier Tang Fei convened the first session of the new cabinet and outlined six major goals for future administration : ensuring national security and improving cross-strait relations ; eliminating " black gold " ( criminal and corrupt influence in politics and big business ) and raising the standard of living ; speeding up reconstruction work in the September 21 earthquake disaster area ; deepening the industrial structure and recreating the economic miracle ; deepening education reform and strengthening culture ; and promoting the reinvention of government and the raising of administrative efficiency .  
He further indicated that he has instructed all security organs that they " are not to carry out surveillance against specific political parties or individuals . " At the same time , said the president , these organs must be diligent in all matters related to national security , economic security , major criminal activity , maintenance of social order , and any other matters that fall within their legal jurisdiction .  
I wanted to stand up and testify in my personal status-as a writer who was imprisoned , shackled , and beaten because I insisted on freedom of speech and refused to bow down before authoritarianism ; and as a " thought criminal " for whom a military court sought the death penalty-to the fact that the dark ages are over in Taiwan , and that mothers will no longer have to cry for political reasons .  
Not long afterwards , he was arrested by the Japanese military for a cartoon in a newspaper depicting a famous Chinese general from the Ming dynasty killing a " dwarf pirate . " ( " Dwarf pirate " has long been a derogatory term used by Chinese to refer to Japanese . ) He thereby became categorized as a " Chinese juvenile political criminal . "  
The law dated from 1930 , and although it had been revised in the intervening years , it contained much that no longer suited the times . Rather than embarking on a major overhaul , it was deemed easier just to junk the whole thing . ( Of course , the commercial , criminal , and tax codes still apply to the publishing industry . ) Opening the market to foreign investment was seen as the best way to prepare the publishing industry for the challenges of WTO membership .  
According to a handbook entitled Medical Disputes Q &amp; A compiled by the Taiwan Health Reform Foundation , the types of redress most patients and their families wish for are : a reasonable explanation ; a sincere apology from the hospital and doctors ; financial responsibility to be taken for the continuing medical care of the patient ; hospitals and doctors to learn lessons ; proposals for specific reform measures ; action to prevent similar mistakes happening again ; substantive punishment for wrongdoers ; reasonable monetary damages or compensation ; and only last of all , criminal penalties .  
What 's more , criminal gangs began to control many of the venues , and related incidents were the subject of frequent unflattering press reports . Because of an underworld disagreement , gang leader Yang Shuang-wu shot and injured singer Kao Ling-feng at one such establishment in Kaohsiung . The incident shocked Taiwan , and many started to view these places as dens of iniquity . Attendance fell markedly .  
The body 's immune responses to these germs-cell-mediated immunity , which is called " type 1 immune response , " and the " type 2 immune response , " known as humoral immunity-are mutually antagonistic . This can result in imbalances , much like when the police deploy all their forces to catch a big criminal and end up letting small-time thieves slip through the net . To an allergic person 's immune system , finding the right balance is as difficult as it is for a seesaw to stay horizontal with children on it .  
The Ministry of Finance should rigorously investigate and hold banks accountable for administrative and criminal liability in this area . Next time a financial institution is found to have leaked customers ' confidential information , the paper suggests , it should be penalized by being barred or restricted from opening new branches or starting new lines of business .  
Effective action at the global level was crucial in preventing and controlling the accumulation of illicit profits and in contributing to the impoverishment and weakening of criminal organizations .  
It was also stressed that the computerization of criminal justice systems should be applied at the national and international levels , with due consideration given to the standards prevailing in both developed and developing countries .  
" Alarmed also by the ability of organized criminal groups to transcend national frontiers , taking advantage of regional arrangements designed to foster free trade and of the gaps in national legislation and international cooperation ,  
Eight years have elapsed since the barbarous aggression against our people , when the three criminal terrorist States moved , with black hatred , against our innocent children , our women and our elderly in a desperate attempt to harm our great people .  
The aim was to establish that , if an organization was held to be criminal , it entailed the possibility of an individual member being found guilty in subsequent proceedings before lesser ( national ) courts of the victorious Powers .  
The idea of applying national law at the level of international law to compensate for lacunae in substantive criminal law is worth considering as a transitional measure , although the manner in which this is effected will require deliberate study .  
The Conference stressed that all persons who perpetrated or authorized criminal acts associated with ethnic cleansing were individually responsible and accountable for such human rights violations .  
Turning to the new draft statute for an international criminal court , she said that it was a definite improvement over the previous draft , since it completed issues that were unsettled or insufficiently addressed .  
Accordingly , an international criminal court that rested on firm legal and institutional bases and enjoyed wide acceptance could serve as an effective instrument for bringing the perpetrators of such crimes to justice .  
The large number of regional conflicts in which international humanitarian law and human rights were seriously violated indicated that there was an urgent need to take practical steps to achieve a form of universal criminal jurisdiction .  
The establishment of an international criminal court involved many complex and difficult issues , such as jurisdiction , applicable law , court structure , prosecution and other matters which must be addressed with utmost care .  The meeting rose at 1.10 p.m .  
Another major obstacle is the broad range of activities in which transnational crime is involved , which are not always covered or sanctioned by existing criminal legislation .  
The difficult question of the qualifications of the judges ( art . 6 ) was handled well , although it was regrettable that a rigid distinction was drawn between judges with criminal trial experience and judges with recognized competence in international law .  
Because controls on growing trade and communication had been unable to keep pace with organized criminal activities , there was an urgent need to elaborate an improved response by criminal justice authorities world wide .  
Also convinced that through their own national legal and judicial systems States must provide appropriate civil , criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights ,  
Also convinced that through their own national legal and judicial systems States must provide appropriate civil , criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights ,  
Concerning article 6 of the Convention , members of the Committee took note of the information contained in the State party 's report that , for acts prohibited under article 4 of the Convention , national legislation provided that criminal or civil proceedings in respect of offences were not subject to any statute of limitations and that compensation or redress was available in cases where administrative decisions violated the provisions of the Constitution or the Convention .  
Invites all States of the region to address , through various forms of cooperation , problems and threats posed to the region , such as terrorism and criminal acts , as well as illegal drug production , consumption and trafficking , which jeopardize the friendly relations among States , hinder the development of international cooperation and result in the destruction of human rights , fundamental freedoms and the democratic basis of pluralistic society ;  
The causes are many : the earlier supply of weapons to client States by the parties to the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets , criminal activity and the collapse of governmental law and order functions ( which both gives free rein to the criminals and creates a legitimate reason for ordinary citizens to acquire weapons for their own defence ) .  
In its interim report ( S / 1994 / 1125 ) , the Commission submitted its preliminary conclusions on serious breaches of international humanitarian law and acts of genocide committed in Rwanda , and recommended that the individuals responsible for those acts be brought to justice before an independent and impartial international criminal tribunal .  
Violence was seen as a vicious circle repeating itself from generation to generation but one that was not irreversible and that could be addressed through multidisciplinary cooperation at the national level , greater condemnation of violence against women and children reflected in criminal justice systems , and programmes to prevent violent behaviour and provide better treatment for victims .  
A collection of data on the status and implementation of existing multilateral , regional and bilateral agreements relating to international terrorism , including information on incidents caused by international terrorism and criminal prosecutions and sentencing , based on information received from the depositaries of those agreements and from Member States ;  
In particular , many delegations noted with satisfaction that by establishing a system of international criminal jurisdiction based primarily on the consent of the States concerned with the alleged crime and complementary to existing national jurisdictions and procedures for international judicial cooperation in criminal matters , the draft reconciled the need for an international criminal court and respect for State sovereignty .  
Thus , it was suggested that the creation of a single international criminal court would better serve the rule of law by offering fuller guarantees of the objective , impartial and uniform application of the future Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind than would ephemeral , ad hoc jurisdictions .  
Another representative noted that the draft statute lacked clarity in that there was no indication as to whether that complementary relationship would be a hierarchical type of relationship , or whether the international criminal court would be given an advisory role vis - - vis national courts or even be competent to vary the decisions of the latter in application of international law .  
Thus , it was stated that the establishment of an international criminal court , with the subsidiary organs mentioned in article 5 and other infrastructures , would entail an enormous financial outlay which might be an extra burden for developing countries .  
It was stated that , if established under the Charter , the Court would be supported by the Organization 's moral authority and its universality , and furthermore the unity of the international legal order in respect of criminal matters would be assured .  
It was also stated that the sensitive issue of national criminal jurisdiction , as well as the principle of State sovereignty , would make express prior consent of States a prerequisite for the establishment of the Court as a system of international criminal jurisdiction .  
The fact that the statute was primarily a procedural instrument underscored , in the view of many delegations , the importance of developing an applicable substantive law to circumscribe more clearly the jurisdiction ratione materiae of the Court so that the two fundamental principles of criminal law , nullum crimen sine lege and nulla poena sine lege , might be respected .  
In this context it was noted that , since international criminal law was not a fully developed area and since the statute of the Court was certain to have an impact upon national legal systems , the jurisdiction should be established on a consensual basis in full regard to the fundamental principle of sovereignty , which should be reflected in all its provisions .  
Another representative pointed out that the idea of applying national law at the level of international law to compensate for lacunae in substantive criminal law as regards the constituent elements of crimes and the penalties to be imposed was worth considering , although the manner in which that was effected would require careful study .  
The above notwithstanding , the wording of subparagraph ( c ) providing that the Court should apply " to the extent applicable , any rule of national law " was considered as too vague by some representatives , who called for more specific language bearing in mind that international law did not yet contain a complete statement of substantive and procedural criminal law . 
Another representative , after pointing out that the draft statute contained no provisions on statutory limitations or on their non-applicability , observed that , if a permanent international criminal court was to become a reality , the Court 's jurisdiction ratione temporis would have to be determined in order to preserve the principle of legal safety . 
The view was also expressed that subparagraphs ( a ) and 2 ( b ) were in blatant contradiction with article 14 , paragraph 7 , of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , and that account should also be taken of the fact that the purpose of an international criminal court was to be complementary to national criminal justice systems , as stated in the preamble to the draft statute . 
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups that engage in the production of , traffic in and distribution of drugs , arms and precursors and essential chemicals , which at times places them beyond the reach of the law , corrupting institutions , undermining the full exercise of human rights and threatening the stability of many societies in the world ,  
With regard to the possibility that special laws or exclusive jurisdictions could be invoked to uphold impunity in respect of human rights violations , a careful study has begun of Guatemalan domestic legislation , with special reference to the military criminal justice system and the identification of cases in which the functioning of this special system could promote impunity .  
The Mission recommends that criminal legislation should be amended so as to incorporate in it a specific description of the crime of torture , making it punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account its grave nature , as required in the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , which has been ratified by Guatemala .  
Also convinced that through their own national legal and judicial systems States must provide appropriate civil , criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights ,  
Specifically , the court could be entitled to require , in accordance with the statute and rules of procedure , that national courts should refer a case to the international criminal court for consideration if the offence which gave rise to the institution of proceedings is regarded as a criminal offence of a general nature , if the national court is not independent or impartial or if proceedings have been initiated with a view to exempting a suspect from international criminal liability .  
A permanent international criminal court has been eagerly awaited by human rights advocates and Governments alike for more than half a century , and the document prepared by the Commission is a milestone in this direction .  
The first concern is that the judges of the international criminal court will have made a public and solemn undertaking under article 14 to exercise their functions under the statute " impartially and conscientiously " and in fairness to this judicial oath a dissenting judge should perhaps be allowed to make his dissent known where the judgement does not express the unanimous opinion of the judges .  
One organization asserted that this recommendation was unfortunately silent on existing mechanisms for inter-agency meetings on public information issues covering high-priority agenda items such as social and economic development , crime prevention and criminal justice , human rights , environment and sustainable development , women and development , population and refugees .  
The establishment of an international criminal court to try individuals charged with crimes that pose a threat to international peace and security , violate basic human rights and forcibly subject others to torture in all its forms is a worthy objective sought by the international community .  
Pursuant to General Assembly resolution 49 / 53 and the relevant request of the Legal Counsel , UNDCP and CPCJB have reviewed the draft statute for an international criminal court contained in the report of the International Law Commission on the work of its forty-sixth session .  3 / The review was carried out in the light of the legislative mandates of both bodies and from the point of view of their substantive competence .  
While the principle of the severity of the offence is sound in view of the need to address the multitude of activities engaged in by organized transnational criminal groups , further elaboration is needed in the light of the differing national perceptions of the severity of individual offences .  
Indeed , in such cases the legal rules governing jurisdiction would not be applicable , the criminal laws of the State that would normally have jurisdiction might be inadequate or there might be particular circumstances on the ground ( disorganization of the judicial apparatus , partiality of the courts because of internal or external conflict , a deliberate refusal to prosecute or extradite ) impeding the administration of justice .  
The third preambular paragraph of the draft statute reiterates the guiding principle that the international criminal court " is intended to be complementary to national criminal justice systems in cases where such trial procedures many not be available or may be ineffective " . 
As a country that is a frequent target for international terrorists and narcotics traffickers , the United States is properly concerned that the work of an international criminal court not compromise important , complex and costly investigations carried out by its criminal , justice or military authorities .  28 .  For the most part , neither drug crimes nor crimes of terrorism occur as isolated criminal acts .  
Effective investigation and prosecution at the national level and close bilateral and multilateral cooperation by countries around the world is essential to addressing the grave problems caused by ongoing criminal enterprises .  
Any interference by the Prosecutor of the international criminal court in this national and bilateral investigative work could jeopardize bringing criminals to justice and have the unfortunate result of the Prosecutor acting as a shield to effective law enforcement .  
It believes that establishing a linkage between the Security Council , which is a political organ by nature and by virtue of its mandate and structure , and the international criminal court , whose establishment is intended to provide a neutral and impartial legal forum , will create enormous problems that will undermine confidence in the court 's neutrality and impartiality .  
The recommendations covered several key issues , including the importance of crime prevention and criminal justice , individual and collective security and safety measures in Islamic society , the impact of transnational crime ( such as organized crime and illicit drug trafficking ) in the region , and future measures concerning regional and international collaboration against crime .  
Bosnia and Herzegovina believes that this tragic incident must not be used for ethically unacceptable and inappropriate political manipulations that espouse the myth that all the sides in Bosnia and Herzegovina should be seen in the same criminal light and as having the same responsibility for the evil that has engulfed my country for more than three years .  
It was emphasized that the proposed court should be established as a body whose jurisdiction would complement that of national courts and existing procedures for international judicial cooperation in criminal matters and that its jurisdiction should be limited to the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole .  
The duty imposed on the Prosecutor in paragraph 1 raised once again the difficulties involved in reconciling the respective responsibilities of the international criminal court and those of national authorities .  
The sectoral advisory services cover programmes relating to human rights , global development issues and policies , energy , human settlements , trade and development , population , natural resources , social development , public administration and finance , crime prevention and criminal justice , statistics and emergency humanitarian assistance .  
On the contrary , through its implementation the Government has induced financial institutions to get to know their customers better and undertake a specific and direct surveillance of transactions in order to prevent their being used as instruments for the illegal concealment , handling , investment or use of money or other goods coming not only from drug-trafficking activities but from any other kind of criminal activity .  
In addition to addressing these issues at a national level , the programmes also assist States in fighting transnational crime , including organized criminal activity , economic and environmental criminality and money-laundering .  
Because corrupt activities on the part of public officials can destroy the potential effectiveness of governmental programmes , hinder development and victimize individuals and groups , it is important that adequate criminal laws , including procedural legislation , be adopted to allow a recourse to sanctions and ensure an effective deterrence .  
Pursuant to article 17 of the statute , it is responsible for the Tribunal 's administration but also for setting up the infrastructure required to ensure the proper functioning of the judicial process in a particularly sensitive and important area of criminal law .  
All those working at the Tribunal realize the historic role which they have to play in setting precedents for future international criminal organs , notably a permanent criminal court - " the missing link of international law " - and they have watched with great interest the tentative moves towards turning the United Nations International Law Commission 's draft statute for a permanent criminal court into a viable court .  
A collection of data on the status and implementation of existing multilateral , regional and bilateral agreements relating to international terrorism , including information on incidents caused by international terrorism and criminal prosecutions and sentencing , based on information received from the depositaries of those agreements and from Member States ;  
They included " Action against national and transnational economic and organized crime and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment : national experiences and international cooperation " , which was considered in a plenary session , with a special session on corruption .  
Following unscrupulous and criminal aggression against Krajina and the genocide committed against the Serb people , Croatia advances untrue , baseless and malicious charges of the alleged involvement of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in incidents around Osijek with the aim of drawing Yugoslavia in the conflict that Croatia itself provoked .  
Today , it is impossible to deny the existence of private entities and public bodies which , under a legal cover , conduct clandestine criminal operations as a parallel activity by hiring people who , in exchange for payment , agree to participate in the commission of unconscionable and illegal acts .  
There have also been infamous cases in which State intelligence authorities or security forces , opposition groups , armed domestic resistance movements or criminal organizations hire mercenaries to engage in illegal actions such as forming paramilitary forces for purposes of repression , organizing death squads or providing military protection for illicit drug trafficking , smuggling or arms trafficking .  
In any case , the possibility of changing this criterion should be analysed and debated with a view to revising current international provisions on the subject , in the light of experiences where nationality has been used to mask the mercenary nature of illicit activities engaged in by a Power that recruits , prepares and pays an individual to perpetrate a criminal act against another country , its Government , its property or a given sector of its population .  
While mercenaries are typically present in situations of armed conflict , it would be incorrect to limit the description to those cases alone , since it applies to any situation in which the sovereignty of States , the self-determination of peoples , political stability and the human rights of populations are affected in a premeditated fashion by operations in which the active agent is a foreign mercenary specially hired to carry out unlawful criminal acts .  
The implementation of the international instruments for mutual assistance in criminal matters and of the model treaties on different aspects of bilateral and multilateral cooperation also requires technical assistance , and efforts have been made to provide this , beginning with the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) countries of western Africa . 
In response to the acknowledged need to strengthen the operational capacity of the United Nations programme , UNDP , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies were called upon to support technical cooperation activities devoted to strengthening the rule of law , in cooperation with the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , including proper coordination and fund-raising efforts .  
That was to include the provision of technical assistance for the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements , based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources , and the drafting of proposed model legislation or agreements on international cooperation in criminal matters , alternative or complementary articles for existing model treaties , and articles for possible model multilateral instruments .  
The feasibility of establishing an integrated system for the periodic gathering and dissemination of information on national crime prevention and criminal justice legislation and its implementation was to be determined , with a view to encouraging appropriate alignment in international cooperation through such means as extradition and other modalities of mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
The Council stressed the importance of continuing to improve the operational activities of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , particularly in developing countries and countries in transition , through advisory services and training programmes , field studies and action-oriented research at the international , regional , subregional , national and local levels .  
The crime prevention and criminal justice programme , including its network of institutes , could usefully be included in the new combined promotional and operational TCDC activities , and priority undertakings such as the replication of successful innovative projects , development of subject-specific TCDC products , promotion of joint strategies to deal with the problems faced by groups of countries , and mobilization of support , including triangular cooperative arrangements .  
Efforts had to take into account the current political situation and the ease with which organized criminal groups crossed borders and took advantage of efforts designed to bring countries closer together and increase the free movement of goods , capital , services and people .  
In their search for new opportunities and markets , organized criminal groups were ready to make sizeable investments in both equipment and human resources and were willing to bring their huge financial power to bear , in addition to using other more violent methods , for eliminating competition .  
The prospect of organized criminal groups infiltrating and attaining controlling interests in crucial sectors of the economies of developing countries and countries in transition had contributed to raising awareness and increasing concern among Governments , particularly at a time of joint efforts towards economic restructuring on the basis of free market principles .  
However , while developed countries already possess the infrastructure and crucial knowledge required in mustering the necessary resources and maximizing their efficiency and effectiveness , developing countries and countries in transition are found in the very difficult position of easily being outpaced by organized criminal groups .  
In the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , States recognized , while acknowledging its global implications , that prevention and control of organized transnational crime must necessarily vary from State to State and region to region and be based upon improvements in national capabilities , increased knowledge and shared experiences about organized criminal groups .  
Further , Governments are alarmed by the increasing involvement of organized transnational crime in legitimate business , coupled with the need of organized criminal groups to find ways of laundering their illicit proceeds .  
The new responsibilities that Governments have to take on because of the escalation of organized transnational crime and the demand for global strategies to combat it , draw attention to the need for effective instruments , bearing in mind that what is most needed is a comprehensive , multi-layered approach to international cooperation in law enforcement and criminal justice in the fight against organized transnational crime .  
One of the major objectives of international cooperation must be to create greater harmonization in criminal justice systems , by improving the standards of countries with weaker criminal justice systems in general or by developing national legislation specifically directed against organized crime .  
However , in the presence of a strong political will and broad consensus , as evidenced by the priority attached to action against organized transnational crime and the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan , it would be possible to ensure that the negotiation process does not result in a diluted document that falls short of establishing the provisions necessary for an effective response to transnational criminal organizations .  
It should also consider conditions that are conducive to the rise and growth of criminal organizations , such as social , economic and political factors , structural characteristics of organized crime , as well as organizational shortcomings in the control agencies .  
In particular , it was recommended that States examine the experience of countries that have confronted organized crime and the intelligence derived from the analysis of its structures and criminal activities , as useful guiding principles concerning which substantive , procedural and regulatory legislation and organizational structures are necessary to combat the phenomenon .  
In the area of substantive legislation , efforts against organized transnational crime would be considerably strengthened through the introduction of reforms focused on criminalization of participation in a criminal organization , criminalization of conspiracy or similar forms of inchoate offences , prohibition of laundering of criminal proceeds , and sanctions and other measures , such as the confiscation of illicit proceeds , aimed at defeating the economic power of criminal organizations .  
The Government of Cuba has made considerable efforts to mitigate the traumatic effects of the criminal blockade on the Cuban nation and has tried to ensure , with the limited resources available to the country , that food and medicines are equally distributed among the people and that the levels of medical care , education , security and social welfare are maintained .  
They called for the speedy establishment of a permanent international criminal court that would prosecute perpetrators of massive violations of human rights , including perpetrators of egregious acts of racial discrimination .  
In order to be included in the list of crimes in the draft Code , such infractions must correspond to the legal rules accepted by States , must be considered serious enough to be defined as crimes against the peace and security of mankind , and must refer to acts sufficiently identifiable to appear in a criminal text .  The matter should be dealt with only from a legal , not a political , perspective .  
In the strong belief that concrete , broad strategies must be developed and applied to fight corruption , we reiterate our commitment to adopt cooperation mechanisms to combat that criminal activity because it weakens the democratic system , undermines the prestige of its institutions and constitutes an agent of social disintegration and distortion of the economic system .  
Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering , and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals ,  
MOCHOCHOKO ( Lesotho ) said that the draft statute was a considerable improvement over the earlier draft , but needed to be further strengthened to ensure that it created a just , fair and effective international criminal institution .  
Ad hoc tribunals could not be a substitute for a permanent international criminal court with the ability to prosecute persons accused of gross violations of humanitarian and human rights law wherever the crimes were committed .  
Only when national trial procedures proved ineffectual or inefficient in deciding such cases would the international community be entitled to have them dealt with by the international criminal court .  
Further discussion of the major issues involved would be required , with a view to the establishment of an effective international criminal court which enjoyed moral authority , independence and universal support .  
These heinous criminal acts , however , were preceded by 170 counts of barbaric and random rocket attack on civilian targets in the heavily crowded residential sectors of the city on 11 November 1995 , which caused the death of 39 citizens of the capital , including schoolgirls and a team of film-makers , and vast destruction of the city , in this regard , I submitted a letter dated 13 November 1995 addressed to you ( see S / 1995 / 950 ) . 
the imbalance between the increasing responsibilities that the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council had given that Branch and the institutional and financial means at its disposal could not be ignored , especially in the light of the growing crime rate , which was directly related to the tremendous corrupting power and the increasingly sophisticated methods of criminal organizations .  
a decision adopted on 28 April 1995 , the High Council of the Republic , the transitional parliament , bearing in mind all the adverse consequences for the Zairians which resulted from the presence of refugees from Rwanda and Burundi , including ecological problems , criminal acts and attempts to dominate the indigenous inhabitants , had decided to demand the unconditional return , without delay , of all refugees and immigrants from those countries .  
situation was critical in certain border provinces , which , overburdened by the provision of enormous financial , material and human resources in the fight against such criminal activities , should receive the support of the international community .  
flow of men and mat �� iel , not to mention the direct involvement of the military leaders of the former Republic of Yugoslavia , played a very important role in the brutal and criminal overrunning of the safe areas , in contravention of all the Security Council resolutions on the matter , and led to the exodus of tens of thousands of civilians and the liquidation of thousands of unarmed men and boys .  
Specific requirements should be identified for bilateral and multilateral cooperation in capacity-building and the training of civil servants in the areas of economic and financial management , the creation of jobs , the eradication of poverty , the provision of adequate criminal justice infrastructures and environmental protection .  
The sixth and last is the growing menace of organized criminal gangs purveying terror , deadly weapons , illicit drugs , indentured labour , and the bodies of our women and children across international borders .  
The uncharted waters ahead remain daunting , defined by bilious seas of unrelenting , sophisticated , transnational criminal activity , which is tearing at the very fabric of society .  
The present momentum for the establishment of a permanent international criminal tribunal should not be lost , but should be matched by commensurate political will to ensure that the work is completed in time for a conference in 1998 .  
Georgia , having undergone the tragedy of conflict in Abkhazia , and having experienced ethnic cleansing and genocide in its own population , is keenly interested in the rapid establishment and effective functioning of an international criminal court .  
It should be marked by a constant , unfailing mobilization of efforts to dismantle the criminal chain of terrorism , including those who are perpetrators , those who are behind them , the various political networks and their sources of financing and supply , and the direct or indirect logistical support given by individuals , groups or States .  
In the case of illicit transfers , however , given their particular subversive nature , which relies on international criminal organizations , countries should focus on improved national legislative measures and their effective implementation , as well as on improving international cooperation and coordination to prevent illegal transfers .  
Decide to combine their efforts to establish effective legal and judicial cooperation in the prevention of crime , especially transnational and organized crime , and the strengthening of criminal justice systems by developing and promoting international instruments pertaining to criminal justice , such as agreements concerning trafficking in women and children , genocide , war crimes , terrorism and drug-related offences .  
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
An operator of the Peruvian Telephone Company ( Jir \ x { 93ee } Washington exchange ) , in Lima , received an anonymous telephone call from an alleged terrorist criminal ( a male voice ) which announced : " We are going to place an explosive device on the fourth floor " .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups that engage in the production of , traffic in and distribution of drugs , arms and precursors and essential chemicals , which at times places them beyond the reach of the law , corrupting institutions , undermining the full exercise of human rights and threatening the stability of many societies in the world ,  
Deeply alarmed also by the growing links at the transnational level between criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals ,  
Recognizing that the new forms of criminal activities of international drug trafficking organizations call for enhanced international cooperation , as well as a renewal of the international commitment to fight against these menaces , and require the formulation of new strategies , approaches and objectives which , respectful of the sovereignty of States , can deal more effectively with the international operations of those involved in the illegal traffic of drugs and arms , the diversion of precursors and essential chemicals , and money laundering through financial and non-financial operations ,  
SRIWIDJAJA ( Indonesia ) said it was vital that the jurisdiction of the international criminal court should be universally accepted , and he concurred with the view that the court should be established as an independent judicial organ by means of a multilateral treaty , as recommended by the International Law Commission .  
Regarding the principle of complementarity , which had some bearing on the relationship between the international criminal court and national judicial systems , the statute prescribed that the court should complement national criminal justice systems in cases where national trial proceedings had proved ineffective .  
That principle created a presumption in favour of national jurisdiction for the reasons contained in the report of the Ad Hoc Committee , namely that the parties concerned would work within existing bilateral and multilateral arrangements , applicable law would be more certain , criminal actions would be less costly and the penalties involved would be clearly defined and easy to enforce .  
AKL ( Lebanon ) said that he would welcome the establishment , by means of a multilateral treaty , of an international criminal court as a permanent and independent judicial organ which would have relations with the United Nations system that would guarantee its authority , universality , and administrative and financial viability .  
Reaffirms the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services as a means for the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme to respond to the needs of the international community in the face of both national and transnational criminality and to assist Member States in achieving the goals of preventing crime within and among States and improving the response to crime , in accordance with General Assembly resolution 46 / 152 and in line with the recommendations of the Ninth Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders ;  
Requests the Secretary-General to facilitate , as appropriate , the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly the United Nations Development Programme and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts ;  
Calls upon the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice at country level and , in pursuance of their mandates , to include such activities in their programmes , emphasizing social development aspects and utilizing the expertise of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme in such activities and cooperating closely on relevant technical assistance projects and advisory missions ;  
Several representatives reported that new structures had been set up to strengthen the office of the Attorney-General in their respective States to investigate and take action against criminal organizations , while others reported the adoption of measures to make judicial cooperation more flexible and transparent , particularly with regard to extradition and mutual assistance . 
The Centre is developing a technical assistance and advisory programme aimed at assisting China in building the necessary administrative and legal structures in the area of criminal law and criminal justice in accordance with democratic principles and respect for human rights .  
98 A series of instructional and educational meetings were held between October 1994 and June 1995 for young lawyers from Siracusa and a number of local conferences and one national seminar were held during the period under review , dealing with numerous aspects of criminal justice , including the role of justice of the peace and penal procedural matters ( priority theme C ) .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 , requested the Secretary-General to facilitate the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects , benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts .  
Under the general supervision of the Registrar , assisted by the Deputy Registrar ( D-1 ) , the service would include six legal officers responsible for : court management and judicial administration ( 1 P-5 ) ; international humanitarian law , criminal law and coordinating the work of legal clerks assisting the Chambers , and general administrative legal issues ( 3-P-4 ) ; and judicial administration in the implementation of directives on the assignment of defence counsel and legal research including in the area of witness protection ( 2 P-3 ) .  
The Minister of the Interior stated that the Sudan could possibly be more successful in its efforts to locate the suspects provided it received full cooperation from the relevant Ethiopian and Egyptian agencies and provided the matter was treated as a criminal case ; he added that , if the case was treated as a political issue , all efforts of the Sudan would be in vain .  
In addition , the Council recommended that the expert group should , in the light of the discussion at the workshop held during the Ninth Congress , explore ways and means of increasing the efficiency of extradition and related mechanisms of international cooperation in criminal matters , having due regard to the rule of law and the protection of human rights , including where appropriate such measures as : ( a ) the provision of technical assistance in the development of bilateral and multilateral agreements based on the United Nations model treaties and other sources ;  
During its fourth world conference on crime prevention and criminal justice , held at Bangkok from 15 to 17 November 1995 , the Asia Crime Prevention Foundation decided , inter alia , to establish a working group with the aim of studying the issues of extradition and mutual legal assistance in Asia and the Pacific , taking into account other experiences at the regional and international levels .  
Stressing that all forms of repression and cruel and inhuman treatment of women and children committed by belligerents in the course of military operations or in occupied territories , including taking them hostage , their imprisonment , the destruction of their dwellings and their forcible eviction , should be considered criminal ,  
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
In that resolution , the Assembly dealt with the matter from a criminological perspective , inviting Member States to adopt specific measures to make the crime prevention and criminal justice system more responsive to domestic violence , for example , by enacting criminal law and procedure and improving the situation and the fair treatment of the female victim .  
The participants in the workshop made the following recommendations , applicable to countries in central and eastern Europe : criminal law and procedure should be reviewed to determine any discriminatory provisions and effects ; consideration should be given to making rape in marriage a criminal offence ; criminal justice practitioners should be sensitized to the dynamics of domestic violence ; the police should be given specific and intensive training in crisis intervention and in the collection of evidence in domestic disputes .  
It reported that national action to combat organized crime and the illegal movement of persons across international frontiers fell into three categories : ( a ) legislative measures , which included prohibition and provided for imposition of criminal penalties for involvement in such activities ; ( b ) administrative measures , which included the establishment of agencies to deal with such activities , as well as the provision of appropriate training to enhance efficiency ; and ( c ) technical measures , which included preventive and investigative action .  
Given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , is crucial , and measures need to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
The General Assembly in resolution 50 / 146 , paragraph 9 , requested the Secretary-General to facilitate , as appropriate , the creation of joint initiatives , including bilateral activities , and the joint formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects benefiting developing countries and countries in transition , involving interested donor countries and funding agencies , particularly UNDP Programme and the World Bank , with a view to establishing and maintaining efficient criminal justice systems on a country-by-country basis as an essential component of developmental efforts .  
44 The observers of non-governmental organizations and individual experts at the Ninth Congress as well as at the fourth session of the Commission fulfilled an important function , particularly by making statements in their capacity as observers on the substantive topics of the agendas , based on their extensive experiences as practitioners working in the field or as distinguished scholars in the area of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
A number of countries reported that cases against law enforcement officials charged with crimes connected with the infliction , instigation or toleration of any act of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment were heard by regular domestic criminal courts .  
With full respect for the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of each country , and within the context of juridical arrangements established with other States , coordinate efforts to combat criminal organizations engaged in migrant trafficking .  
During the special plenary session of the Congress devoted to technical cooperation , it was stated that technical cooperation was indispensable to building and supporting both democratic institutions and effective criminal justice systems .  
It was also noted that further modalities had to be explored in addition to the existing forms of providing technical assistance , including advisory services aimed at drafting new legislation , at adapting model laws , and at developing comprehensive national criminal legislation , training activities , exchange of information , and assistance provided as part of peace-keeping operations .  
9 The General Assembly , in its resolution 50 / 146 of 21 December 1995 , recognized the direct relevance of crime prevention and criminal justice to sustained development , stability , security and improved quality of life , as well as the urgent need to increase technical cooperation activities to assist countries , particularly developing countries and countries in transition , with their efforts in translating United Nations policy guidelines into practice .  
The recipients , selected among 106 nominees from Africa , Asia , Latin America and the Caribbean , eastern Europe and the CIS , focused their work on a wide range of topics , such as illegal arms and drug trafficking , money-laundering , organized crime , reform of the correctional system , juvenile delinquency , computerization of criminal justice information and crime prevention .  
In this regard , it is important to recall that the World Conference of the Asia Crime Prevention Foundation , held at Bangkok from 15 to 17 November 1995 , decided that the Foundation , in cooperation with the Division , should sponsor a comprehensive technical cooperation and assistance programme with special emphasis on : institutional reform and upgrading of criminal justice institutions ; organization of training courses and seminars aimed at human resources development ; and formulation and implementation of technical assistance projects in developing countries .  
The new criminal provisions against money-laundering were based on the assumption that money-laundering could be defined as the systematic disguising of illegal assets , using the scope offered by the legal financial market , with a view to shielding them from seizure by the criminal prosecution authorities and preserving their economic value .  
The legislation regulating the use of cash exceeding 20-million liras ensured the identification of bank and financial brokers , and imposed upon them the obligation to inform the Questore of all suspicious transactions , without incurring penal and administrative sanctions because their collaboration exonerated them from criminal liability .  
The two strategies followed by Mexico in this field were as follows : ( a ) establishing channels for communication of intelligence and information that would make it possible to expand the knowledge base in each country and to enhance the process of communication with countries that possessed more advanced techniques ; and ( b ) international cooperation in combating criminal activities that frustrated the efforts of Governments to fulfil their commitment to promote human rights , fundamental freedoms and democratic decision-making .  
The major characteristics of the draft law might be summarized as follows : ( a ) money-laundering would be established as an offence with a broader definition , covering the proceeds of crime as money and monetary instruments , property and proceeds derived from any criminal activity ; ( b ) a confiscation provision with a broader coverage than existing provisions had been included ; ( c ) freezing and seizing of assets had been covered in specific provisions ; and ( d ) controlled delivery had been introduced for the first time .  
The adoption of the 1988 Convention not only marked the first decisive step in mobilizing the international community in the fight against illicit drug trafficking , but also defined money-laundering offences and required parties to the Convention to proscribe them as serious criminal offences that would be severely punished and subject to extradition .  
In its resolution 1995 / 27 , section II , the Council requested the Secretary-General to consider the feasibility of establishing an integrated system for the periodic gathering and dissemination of information on national legislation in crime prevention and criminal justice and its implementation , taking into account the current and planned capabilities of the United Nations Crime and Justice Information Network and the activities of other United Nations entities and relevant intergovernmental organizations .  
In addition , the Council invited Member States to cooperate in that regard , with a view to encouraging progressive alignment regarding , inter alia , international cooperation , extradition and other bilateral and multilateral modalities of mutual assistance in criminal matters and requested the Secretary-General to report thereon to the Commission at its fifth session .  
Canada has reported that the five major groupings of criminal organizations operating in the country are outlaw motorcycle groups and Aboriginal , Asian , eastern European and Italian organized crime groups , while there is evidence that Colombian drug cartels and the Jamaican " posses " are also active . 
18 If transnational criminal organizations reap considerable benefits from their links with the licit business and financial sectors , they also find it both necessary and advantageous to co-opt public officials , whether to obtain official documents or export licences , to help launder the proceeds of criminal activity or to provide intelligence .  
Such a method of operation may be characterized by widespread use of bribery and favours to ensure the malleability of key positions and agencies ; political funding to ensure that politicians elected to office will be indebted to the criminal organizations ; carefully targeted " payoffs " to law enforcement personnel to provide intelligence ; and the provision of financial incentives to members of the judiciary to ensure that the penalties for criminal activities are either not imposed or are modest .  
The closed nature of ethnic communal groups , enhanced by language barriers and an often imported distrust of the police , make immigrant communities in many countries ideal recruiting and operating grounds for criminal organizations .  
In a confidential assessment completed by the Australian Federal Police , it was noted that Italian organized criminal organizations had penetrated a number of government and non-government agencies and at least one political party and had entrenched themselves in legitimate business to give themselves an air of respectability . 7 Even when they have not achieved this level of penetration , transplanted criminal organizations can still pose formidable challenges to law enforcement , as Chinese organized criminal organizations seem to be doing in South Africa and Russian organized criminal organizations are doing throughout much of Europe . 
48 Argentina has pointed out the merits of common regional strategies and measures against organized transnational crime , while Australia , Canada , Philippines , Republic of Korea and Turkey have drawn attention to the growing number of their bilateral agreements on extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
Cuban legislation has made association with criminal intent an offence and has proscribed as punishable offences those types of behaviour associated with the most common forms of organized transnational crime , but has made no provision for controlled deliveries and electronic surveillance .  
The latter was designed to prevent , investigate and punish violence against women in all its forms , defining the most appropriate criminal laws , procedures and penalties , and spelling out the most practical and concrete national and international action and measures designed to achieve the strategic objectives ( D.l-3 and L . 1-9 ) outlined in the Platform for Action to counter violence against women and the girl child , as priority concerns .  
Governments should be encouraged to make earmarked funds available for specific short-term and long-term activities designed to promote significant progress toward elimination of violence against women through an upgraded and more effective criminal justice system that ensures fair treatment , and that achieves concrete results by means of rigorous needs assessments and evaluations . 
Other representatives stated that the congresses on the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders , the status of which had been modified since they had begun acting as consultative body to the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme , should henceforth be better able to respond to the actual needs of Member States , but should nevertheless not fail to set precise objectives and reduce the number of resolutions adopted .  
The rich debate on the results achieved in dealing with the substantive issues on the agenda of the Congress confirmed the leading role of the congresses in the promotion of more effective crime prevention and criminal justice policies and strategies by recommending action at the national , regional and international levels .  
The information received suggests that differences in the judicial traditions , systems and practices of the responding States did not prevent an increased number of countries from including in their domestic legislation , substantial and procedural provisions designed to improve the position of victims in civil , criminal and administrative proceedings .  
The proper functioning of the law enforcement agencies is essential not only to an effective criminal justice policy , but also to the underlying premise of the protection of the fundamental human rights of individuals .  
Behind the trafficking in children were situations involving poverty and abandonment , which often stemmed from social and economic problems of families , such as widespread unemployment ; little State support for large families or for families with little income ; young persons quitting school because of financial problems of their families ; debts of families contracted with usurers or with criminal organizations repaid by illicit work or illicit activities involving minors ; and moral or social degeneration in suburbs .  
For example , in some States , no separate jurisdiction for juveniles exists ; pre-conflict stage resolution is not effectively used ; diversion from criminal justice systems can not be practised because of the absence of adequate alternative programmes ; the administration of juvenile justice is inefficient ; investigation and prosecution procedures are deficient ; placement of juveniles in pre-trial detention is used inappropriately and for too long ; or deprivation of children 's liberty is not used as a last resort but as a general reaction to juvenile delinquency .  
As described in greater detail in the report of the Secretary-General on technical advisory services for the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme ( E / CN . 15 / 1996 / 8 ) , such resources could be used for technical cooperation activities and advisory services geared towards building and supporting democratic institutions and effective criminal justice systems with emphasis on the complementary relationship of justice , peace and development and the need to address them simultaneously .  
The Branch has also issued in response to new legislative enactments , additional reports on the review of priority themes , in accordance with Commission resolution 1 / 1 on strategic management ; action against national and transnational economic and organized crime , and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment ; and capital punishment and implementation of the safeguards guaranteeing the protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty .  
The general orientation of this programme is to promote more effective international cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice by devising strategies to deal with global problems and by assisting Governments in their national and multilateral efforts to respond to changing crime trends , as well as to create the necessary instruments and institutions for a more accountable , transparent and effective crime prevention and control system .  
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation thanks the heads of the diplomatic missions and the representatives of international and non-governmental organizations that visited King Khaled University Hospital in order to observe what had taken place , extend their sympathy to the people of Burundi and express their outrage at these criminal acts , which were directed exclusively against defenceless people and the country 's principal medical establishment . 
As stated by a number of members , " it was preferable to designate a specific conduct of States as criminal and to regulate the consequences through judicial review and the introduction of substantive rules to spare the population of the criminal State extreme hardship rather than to leave that whole area unregulated , concealing the punitive element under the guise of restitution or guarantees against repetition .  
The consequences of substance use are diverse , including acute and chronic health problems , disruption to interpersonal relationships ( particularly within families ) , social marginalization , criminal behaviour , school failure , vocational problems and failure to achieve normal adolescent milestones .  
The national law against the illegal smuggling of individuals into the country is embodied in the Immigration and Nationality Act , of which , the section entitled " Bringing in and harbouring certain aliens " , sets out criminal penalties , imprisonment and fines for the crimes of bringing or attempting to bring aliens into the country at other than a port of entry , transporting or harbouring undocumented aliens , and encouraging or inducing an alien to come to the country in violation of its law .  
If there exists substantiated evidence of overt and covert governmental financial influence or otherwise to induce an organization to undertake acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations , or substantiated evidence of influence from proceeds resulting from criminal activities , such as the illicit drugs trade , money laundering or the illegal arms trade ; EU proposes :  
Technical advisory services were provided by the Group on a variety of development issues , covering such areas as : inland water transport ; subregional cooperation for lake basin development ; implementation of the African Platform for Action on Women ; formulation of development priorities , programmes and projects ; economic cooperation and integration ; human resources development and utilization , and energy development ; criminal justice and crime prevention ; mineral resources and development ; agricultural development ; rural development ; industrial development ; and science and technology development . 
The information transmitted is often designed to bring about the provisional arrest of a criminal with a view to subsequent extradition .  The organization also has an analytical crime intelligence unit working on international crime and producing reports that are extremely useful in connection with offences such as money-laundering , where transnational movements are very difficult to trace .  
These included : ( a ) the low level of access to the system of administration of justice and , in particular , the failure to respect the right to have interpreters and translators , which would permit indigenous peoples to enjoy on equal terms judicial guarantees in criminal matters ; ( b ) the failure of the State and society at large to provide effective controls and valid measures with respect to human rights violations ; ( c ) poor enforcement of the constitutional and legal guarantees relating to the recognition and enjoyment of their fundamental freedoms .  
Notwithstanding the above , the Government 's compliance with the commitment to supporting and strengthening institutions for the protection of human rights is still highly inadequate , as shown by the absence or weak presence of such institutions in wide areas of the country and the fact that the bodies responsible for implementing this commitment lack a comprehensive policy in criminal matters .  
Ukraine is prepared to cooperate in the effort to combat terrorism , international organized crime , illegal trafficking in narcotic drugs , psychotropic substances , explosives , poisonous substances and radioactive materials , and illegal transborder movements of persons , cargoes , goods and valuables ; in the effort to suppress crimes against persons and government property , and criminal offences in the economic , financial and banking spheres ; and in exchanges of convicted persons .  
Before commencement of the questioning , the suspect shall be informed in detail of the acts of which he is accused , along with all available background information relating to them , a summary of the content of the existing pieces of evidence and the applicable criminal laws .  
International and local observers take the view that principal responsibility for the continuing insecurity lies with the local police , who are either unable or unwilling to take effective action against the ongoing wave of criminal activity against the Croatian Serbs .  
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
A collection of data on the status and implementation of existing multilateral , regional and bilateral agreements relating to international terrorism , including information on incidents caused by international terrorism and criminal prosecutions and sentencing , based on information received from the depositaries of those agreements and from Member States ;  
As to the nature and causes of small arms ' destabilizing accumulation and transfer , in his January 1994 Supplement to an Agenda for Peace , the Secretary-General identified four basic reasons : earlier supply during the cold war , internal conflicts , competition for commercial markets and criminal activity combined with the collapse of governmental law and order .  
They include financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal liability of the member of the force . 
Recovery may also be sought from States contributing contingents where combat-related damage is caused by members of their national contingent in violation of international humanitarian law and where the international criminal responsibility of the individual member is entailed .  
They include : financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from States contributing contingents for damage caused by gross negligence , wilful misconduct , or which entails the international criminal responsibility of the individual member of the Force .  
The Special Rapporteur has maintained and continues to maintain that mercenaries exist ; that they are not a small number of individuals ; that they are groups of professionals selling their skill in war and violence ; that they are also criminal organizations , an international blight in their perpetration of acts of violence which ruin human lives , create material losses , hamper economic activity and extend to terrorist attacks that have touched off or aggravated conflicts , with often catastrophic results for the peoples affected by them . 
Consequently , in his previous report to the General Assembly ( A / 50 / 390 , para . 28 ) , the Special Rapporteur indicated that illicit activities in which nationality is used to mask their mercenary nature by a Power that recruits , prepares and pays an individual to perpetrate a criminal act against another country , its Government , its property or a given sector of its population should be analysed and debated with a view to revising current international provisions on the subject .  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
The Secretary-General concluded that , given the complexity of the issues involved and the substantial role played by transnational organized crime in global criminal activity , international cooperation , particularly in trans-border law enforcement , was crucial , and measures needed to be specified and applied by all concerned .  
At its fifth session , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice adopted resolution 5 / 2 , entitled " Technical cooperation and interregional advisory services in crime prevention and criminal justice " , in which it reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services as a means for the Programme to respond to the needs of the international community in the face of both national and transnational criminality , as well as the importance of continuing to improve and strengthen the operational activities of the Programme .  
Despite the interest expressed in these projects , inter alia , by the countries where these peacekeeping missions are carried out , subsequent project proposals related to training needs of the civilian police of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium ( UNTAES ) , the International Police Task Force ( IPTF ) of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina ( UNMIBH ) and the local police forces , including the establishment of a focal point for strengthening of criminal justice institutions , have so far received little support .  
Especially fruitful cooperation was established with the Agency for Cultural and Technical Cooperation , which funded and organized the printing and dissemination of additional copies of the Compendium of United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice in French , as well as the translation into French of the Basic Training Manual for Correctional Workers , and provided financial support also for the implementation of a comprehensive project in assistance to the criminal justice system for Burkina Faso , which was undertaken in March 1996 .  
The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice , at its fifth session , held from 21 to 31 May 1996 , was informed of the Institute 's efforts to promote regional technical cooperation and to coordinate activities in crime prevention , thus aiming at the promotion of sustainable development and respect for the rule of law by making criminal justice systems more effective in Africa .  
The Institute was encouraged by an increased willingness of African States to base their policy decisions with regard to crime prevention and criminal justice issues on appropriate , adequate , valid and reliable data , as has been indicated by several participants of training activities organized by the Institute . The Institute will continue to undertake advisory missions and train national officials towards establishing appropriate structures and systems for the regular production of the required crime data .  
Considering the priority that African Governments are giving to achieve economic growth and sustainable development , considering also the challenge of growing criminality , both national and transnational , it is imperative that all measures that are being taken to achieve sustainable development are linked with crime prevention and criminal justice .  
Second , it accepted the principle that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes were in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that might be invoked to justify them . 
Often linked to other criminal activities such as the illegal arms trade , drug trafficking and money laundering , terrorism knew no boundaries , and no one State was safe against it ; effective and concerted international cooperation was therefore essential . 
These measures are : ( a ) the establishment of a permanent international criminal court with universal jurisdiction over mass violations of human rights and humanitarian law ; such an international criminal court would have to be bestowed with an adequate mandate and sufficient means to enable it to conduct thorough investigations and enforce the implementation of its decisions ; and ( b ) the adoption of a convention , similar to the Convention against Torture , which would provide domestic courts with international jurisdiction over persons suspected of having committed mass violations of the right to life .  
In addition , Tunisia 's penal system is sufficiently well developed from the standpoint of criminal legislation and juridical institutions to ensure the punishment of any use of scientific progress for purposes prejudicial to human life or individual freedom or privacy .  
In paragraphs 38 to 44 of his report , the Secretary-General discusses several means of limiting the liability of the Organization , such as financial and temporal limitation , counter-claims and off-sets , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal responsibility on the part of a member of the force .  
A renewed commitment by all involved in organized society , political parties , religious groups , communal groups , law enforcement agencies , to eschew resort to criminal violence in pursuit of their objectives needs to be declared and implemented .  
In a memorandum dated 11 April 1996 addressed to the Assistant Secretary-General for Planning and Support , Department of Peacekeeping Operations , and a similar memorandum dated 25 July 1996 to the Officer-in-Charge of the Procurement and Transportation Division and to all executive officers at Headquarters , chiefs of administration at offices away from Headquarters and international criminal tribunals , the Assistant Secretary-General for Conference and Support Services has established strict procedures in processing ex post facto and partial ex post facto cases .  
The Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers expresses grave concern that in Nigeria today substantial judicial power , particularly in the administration of criminal justice , is vested in the military and special ad hoc tribunals to the exclusion of the ordinary courts . 
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money-laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
On the question of limitations of liability ( para . 38 ) , given the substantial increase in the number and amount of third-party claims against the United Nations , the General Assembly might wish to consider , inter alia , financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal liability of the member of the force .  
It is pertinent to note that during the period under review , the secretariat of the AALCC organized , within the framework of the Consultative Committee at its thirty-fifth session , held in March 1996 in Manila , a special meeting on the proposed establishment of an international criminal court , which furnished a forum for an exchange of views on the draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission on that proposed international criminal court . 
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
In the light of events in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda , serious thought should be given to the current state and future direction of the development of the criminal aspects of international humanitarian law applicable in non-international armed conflicts .  
Mr . ECONOMIDES ( Greece ) said that , from the legal standpoint , one could question the wisdom of establishing a dual regime whereby crimes of aggression - far and away the most serious crime in relations between States - would be tried by an international criminal court , while the other four crimes included in the draft Code would be subject to the concurrent jurisdiction of national courts and an international criminal court .  
The Contracting States shall ensure that their national laws recognize that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are under any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them .  
Portugal 's domestic legislation provided for the criminal responsibility of legal persons , including that of the State , and there were merits in developing the concept of international criminal responsibility , but the draft articles did not include specific consequences attached to a crime as opposed to a mere wrongful act .  
Noting that the Preparatory Committee continued the discussion of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute and initiated consideration of draft texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court ,  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
Efforts should continue for the establishment of an international criminal court to combat the impunity enjoyed by the perpetrators of the most serious crimes against humanity , the worst war criminals and the worst violators of human rights , who went unpunished as a result of defunct or seriously flawed judicial systems and pro domo amnesty laws .  
Under article R . 645 _ 1 of the Penal Code , a fine of up to 10,000 francs is imposed for publicly wearing a uniform or displaying insignia or emblems resembling those worn by the members of an organization declared criminal by the N \ x { e16c } nberg Tribunal ( SS , Gestapo , SD and Nazi Commander Corps ) or by any person found guilty of crimes against humanity .  
The departmental coordination unit to combat racism , xenophobia and antisemitism , set up within each departmental council for the prevention of delinquency under the circular issued by the Prime Minister to the prefects on 1 March 1993 , meets at least once a year to monitor problems of racism , initiate warning procedures , if necessary , collect information on local criminal policy , promote the amicable settlement of disputes and , in the light of particular local characteristics , propose measures to strengthen social cohesiveness . 
On 16 March 1994 , he was charged by the Poitiers correctional court with carrying a prohibited weapon and wearing the uniform of an organization declared to be criminal and sentenced to a four _ month suspended sentence and 200 hours of public service over a period of 18 months , together with a 4,000 franc fine and the confiscation of the uniform and the weapon ( No . 93-29 ) .  
Whether legislation ( criminal and / or family law ) includes a prohibition of all forms of physical and mental violence , including corporal punishment , deliberate humiliation , injury , abuse , neglect or exploitation , inter alia within the family , in foster and other forms of care , and in public or private institutions , such as penal institutions and schools ;  
" Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;

Others had felt that certain kinds of environmental damage , such as damage caused by the deliberate detonation of nuclear explosions or pollution of entire rivers , should entail the individual criminal responsibility of those responsible , particularly since the fate of future generations was at stake .  
The concept of an international crime , which was not strictly identical to the notion of criminal responsibility in national law , indicated clearly that the violation of the legal and moral obligations essential to the peace , survival and prosperity of the international community was considered to be on a par with the most serious criminal offences punishable under national law .  
Given that the rules they set forth were complementary , and that States parties to the Code would , ipso facto , be called upon to recognize the existence of an international criminal court , her delegation considered that the Commission should concentrate on drafting two harmonious and complementary texts of equal legal value , whether separate or incorporated .  
The practical difficulties in proving racial motivation beyond reasonable doubt , the adequacy of existing arrangements whereby the activities of extremist or racist organizations had been dealt with under existing criminal laws , and the general power of the courts to take racial motivation into account as an aggravating feature within existing maximum penalties were also addressed .  
However , the easy availability of weapons , the high incidence of armed criminal activity and the fact that the first police officers graduated only 18 months ago are clear indications that the HNP faces formidable challenges in its efforts to maintain a secure and stable environment .  
Belgium is in favour of the adoption of a binding instrument which , supplementing the Convention on the Rights of the Child , would have the effect of compelling the signatory States to rank practices linked to the sexual exploitation of children as penal offences , so that they can be punished under criminal law .  
\ x { f448 } RK ( Slovenia ) said that the Code of crimes against the peace and security of mankind would complement the functioning of the future international criminal court and also serve domestic legal systems by unifying the criminal law and practice concerning the crimes which were considered to be the most serious crimes under international law .  
The Secretariat could prepare draft final articles that established a procedure for revision of the future Code , defined the relationship between the latter , the draft statute of the international criminal court and international conventions or treaties , and prohibited the formulation of reservations with a view to ensuring the universality and integrity of the Code .  
In that connection , bearing in mind that the draft Code and the international criminal court would form part of a single international legal regime , he hoped that the court 's statute would provide more specific guidance on issues which were not clearly defined in , or omitted from , the draft Code .  
Moreover , and this point has been stressed by several speakers today , the experience of the Tribunal for Rwanda , like the experience of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia , is to be considered as one of the key elements for the future establishment of a permanent international criminal court , a project that is well under way and for which Italy has offered to host , in 1998 , a diplomatic conference to adopt a statute for such a court .  
The main difficulty in controlling illicit drugs was that well-organized , well-financed and closely-knit criminal cartels had flexible mechanisms , were capable of threatening entire States and did not hesitate to corrupt officials in order to reach their goals .  
Concerning the procedural aspects of the question , it had become clear that the establishment of a permanent international criminal court posed difficult political and technical problems .  
To that end , the court should be based on optional jurisdiction , its jurisdiction should cover only the most serious crimes of concern to the international community as a whole , it should ensure respect for and primacy of national criminal justice systems , it should be an independent international juridical institution , and accused persons should be accorded all relevant individual human rights and commonly recognized procedural guarantees .  
Ukraine had always supported the creation of an international criminal court and was ready to participate actively in the future work , in the hope that the international community would demonstrate enough political will to meet what was an historic challenge .  
His delegation had actively participated in every aspect of the work , as the United States was committed to the establishment of a fair , effective and truly international criminal court that met all relevant standards of due process and strengthened both international and national law enforcement and military justice interests .  
In order to prevent or minimize unnecessary jurisdictional conflicts between the international criminal court and national courts , the future convention should delineate clearly their respective jurisdictions .  
The General Assembly in 1994 created an ad hoc committee to consider the establishment of a permanent international criminal court , based upon a report and draft statute prepared by the International Law Commission . 23 The Assembly has since established a preparatory committee to prepare a draft convention for such a court that could be considered at an international conference of plenipotentiaries . 24 This momentum must not be lost . 
The establishment of an international criminal court would be a monumental advance , affording , at last , genuine international jurisdictional protection to some of the world 's major legal achievements . 
The members of the Sub-Committee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
At the same time , States are moving towards establishing the individual penal responsibility of those who commit extremely grave international crimes , through the creation of special courts and the forthcoming establishment of an international criminal court .  
Noting that the Preparatory Committee continued the discussion of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute and initiated consideration of draft texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court ,  
Such educational material which may necessarily involve detailed information about transmission risks and may be targeted to groups engaging in illegal behaviour , such as injecting drug use and homosexual behaviour , where applicable , should not be wrongfully subject to censorship or obscenity laws or laws making those imparting the information liable for aiding and abetting criminal offences .  
There have been no major criminal trials or detentions for lengthy periods , but the deprivation of liberty of leaders and activists of opposing political parties has continued , for brief periods of a few days , often accompanied by physical ill _ treatment , threats and the imposition of fines as a means of intimidating them into giving up political activities .  
Also in relation to the clause mentioned in paragraph 20 , the National Reconciliation Act shall extinguish criminal liability for related common crimes committed in the armed conflict , such crimes being defined as those which are directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to the commission of the political crimes referred to in the preceding paragraph and which can not be shown to be motivated by personal goals .  
In respect of persons who were involved in the internal armed conflict owing to institutional mandates , the National Reconciliation Act shall contain specific provisions equivalent to those previously mentioned , in that they shall extinguish criminal liability for common crimes perpetrated with the aim of preventing , thwarting , suppressing or punishing the commission of political crimes and related common crimes , where such crimes were directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to that aim , unless it is demonstrated that there is no relationship between the criminal act and the stated aim .  
The case has some special features , not only because of its innately tragic nature , but because of its more immediate effects ; for the first time a President of the Republic accepted institutional responsibility for an occurrence ; for the first time a massacre was immediately brought before the courts ; for the first time a whole military unit was taken to court ; for the first time military jurisdiction was set supplanted by the civil courts in a case with military defendants ; for the first time criminal charges of extrajudicial execution were preferred .  
Given this appalling situation , we urge the international community , as represented by its specialized organizations and institutions and first and foremost by the Security Council , the International Committee of the Red Cross , the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and the States signatories to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 , to discharge their humanitarian responsibilities and obligations by condemning these most heinous violations committed by the criminal Ethiopian Tigray forces against the civilians and soldiers who have fallen victim to the brutal aggression launched on our eastern borders .  
Further consideration of the major substantive and administrative issues arising out of the draft statute for an international criminal court prepared by the International Law Commission and , taking into account the different views expressed during the meetings , drafting of texts , with a view to preparing a widely acceptable consolidated text of a convention for an international criminal court as a next step towards consideration by a conference of plenipotentiaries .  
The growing international concern at such problems as freedom from arbitrary arrest or detention , protection against all forms of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , circumstances and conditions of detention and imprisonment , and humanization of criminal justice were cornerstones of the protection of human rights .  
In its resolution 5 / 2 , the Commission again requested the Secretary-General to continue to strengthen the cooperation with UNDCP , including the undertaking of joint initiatives , and called upon the Department for Development Support and Management Services and the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat , UNDP , the World Bank and international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice , utilizing the expertise of the Programme .  
Member States are also urged to rely on the existing United Nations model treaties on extradition , mutual assistance in criminal matters , transfer of proceedings and transfer of prisoners , as necessary , as useful tools in improving international cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of cases of illicit trafficking in motor vehicles ;  
The characteristics of those criminal groups , which closely resemble those of groups operating in other countries , their hierarchical structure , internal code of conduct , resources available and ability to penetrate the market , make local organized crime a highly dangerous feature for the newly established social and economic setting of Belarus .  
The main conclusions of the seminar were that relevant international organizations should provide their assistance to countries in need , while the latter should make every possible effort to ratify existing relevant international instruments and to elaborate new ones aimed at combating organized transnational crime .  8 .  Bosnia and Herzegovina indicated that its criminal legislation contained provisions that would allow it to deal with criminal acts carried out by organized crime groups .  
In particular , the country had witnessed during the war forms of crimes that , given their sophistication and the means employed , were classified as organized criminal activities , in particular illicit trafficking in stolen cars , passing of counterfeit banknotes , mostly United States dollars and deutsche mark , and suspicious financial transactions that were considered to cover up money - laundering schemes .  
Owing to the cross-border character of those criminal activities , Bosnia and Herzegovina recognized the importance of and was ready for cooperation with other members of the international community in fighting organized crime , starting with the regional level , where the Government was preparing a draft agreement to be signed with a neighbouring country on mutual assistance and collaboration in preventing and controlling organized crime , illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and terrorism .  
At the international level , over the last decade , a number of treaties , agreements and other instruments on mutual assistance in criminal matters had been signed with several countries of various regions , in addition to an agreement with the European Union ( EU ) on precursors and chemical substances used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs .  
The Estonian criminal code considered as organized crime groups those criminal associations composed of three or more members who , on a constant basis and with identified functions , committed serious criminal offences ; using that definition , the Estonian authorities reported that in the last decade more than 10 criminal associations had been identified in the country , 8 of them operating permanently since their formation in the mid-1980s .  
Greece indicated that although no legal provisions had been enacted that dealt with organized transnational crime in particular , its law enforcement agencies were operating against organized crime and making use of criminal legislation designed to tackle illicit drug trafficking , crimes related to firearms , money-laundering , trafficking in illegal migrants and other offences typically committed by organized crime groups , and that a number of characteristics of organized crime had been identified within the framework of EU and were being applied by national authorities to classify an illegal action as a form of organized crime .  
Particularly relevant was the legislation enacted to control money-laundering and criminal assets in general , which included a broad number of criminal activities whose revenues were to be disguised through money-laundering schemes , the reversal of the onus probandi as to the source of the assets for those who were sentenced for one of the crimes covered by the law and the obligation for financial institutions to report any suspect transaction to the competent authorities .  
Those measures included the establishment of a national standing committee composed of law enforcement officers and academic experts charged with undertaking research on various forms of crime usually carried out by criminal organizations and of a department of public security specialized in organized crime , as well as the development of specialized training programmes for law enforcement personnel and public awareness campaigns to sensitize the Saudi public to the dangers posed by organized crime .  
The Slovak authorities , concerned that illicit drug trafficking , terrorism , arms trafficking , fraud , money-laundering and other criminal activities being carried out by criminal groups with international connections might have a negative impact on the still relatively young national institutions and society in general , had taken steps to strengthen the law enforcement capacity of the national agencies , to create a better understanding among the population of the risks posed by organized crime and to reinforce international cooperation with a view to fighting internationally operating criminal groups .  
Major criminal activities in which organized transnational crime was engaged were violent behaviour and the use of bribery , graft and extortion that could lead to the subversion of the political , social and economic infrastructure , drug trafficking , terrorist activities , kidnapping , prostitution , counterfeiting of currencies , manipulation of financial institutions and markets , international money-laundering and financial fraud , arms smuggling , alien smuggling and computer crime .  
The participants expressed deep concern at the aggravation of the situation of organized transnational crime , including illicit drug trafficking , corruption and money-laundering , experienced throughout the region and emphasized the threat posed by those forms of criminal activity to government structures and democratic institutions and to the population in general .  
The importance of controlling the spread of organized crime in the region and enabling the national criminal justice systems to deal with the threat was also recognized by the development of a project that would encompass two training seminars in the application of the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters of the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) , with a focus on extradition and organized transnational crime , for judges , prosecutors and police officers from west African States .  
Their main objectives include assistance in drafting and implementing up-to-date legislation in the field of preventing and controlling organized transnational crime and associated criminal activities ; assistance to selected government departments in meeting problems raised by the legal reform process through training and the provision of short-term expertise ; and strengthening of the criminal justice system capacity to fight organized crime , also in cooperation with international counterparts .  
CIS countries had realized the serious threat posed to their social , political and economic systems by criminal aggression and they were developing defensive measures , which included law enforcement cooperation , harmonization of existing criminal laws and drafting of new legislation , and multilateral treaties .  
The follow-up to the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan has generated both a focused discussion on the issue of organized transnational crime , as well as a wealth of information that would need systematization and analysis to be transformed into practical tools , in particular model legislation , training for law enforcement and advisory assistance for the reform of the criminal justice system .  
It has also become clear that the problems created for countries by organized transnational crime may be solved only through the adoption and implementation of measures that could comprise up-to-date legislation to deal with this criminal phenomenon ; increased capacity of criminal justice systems to enforce existing legislation and control organized transnational crime ; strengthened ability to gather and analyse reliable information on organized crime activities , with a view to devising preventive and control policies ; and more effective inter-state cooperation when investigating , prosecuting or judging organized transnational crime offences .  
On the basis of a set of background documents and a compendium of summarized project proposals the informal consultative group stressed the importance of crime prevention and criminal justice in development , analysed the role of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme , its comparative advantages and potential , and recommended specific modalities of resource mobilization , after having reviewed national policies and practices relating to development-assistance funding .  
More generally , it was agreed that the uniform rules to be prepared should not attempt to deal with any of the issues of national security , public policy , criminal or administrative law that might become involved in the implementation of digital signature schemes .  
Mindful that no one should be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , that such actions constitute a criminal attempt to destroy a fellow human being physically and mentally , which can never be justified under any circumstances , by any ideology or by any overriding interest , and convinced that a society that tolerates torture can never claim to respect human rights ,  
D . 1 .  * This compilation of information concerning criminal acts committed by the separatists is based on the evidence of 15,000 witnesses and innocent victims of those acts , as also on a large amount of photographic and video material gathered by the Prosecutor 's Office of Georgia in the process of the investigation and contained in more than 100 volumes .  
In the absence of a ratification making it possible to apply a universal jurisdiction clause to the country where the crime was committed , States may for efficiency 's sake take measures in their internal legislation to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction over serious crimes under international law committed outside their territory which by their nature are within the purview not only of internal criminal law but also of an international punitive system to which the concept of frontiers is alien .  
All victims shall have access to a readily available , prompt and effective remedy in the form of criminal , civil , administrative or disciplinary proceedings covered by the restrictions on prescription set out in principle 29 .  
Not many reports have furnished sufficient information concerning such relevant matters as the minimum age at which a juvenile may be charged with a criminal offence , the maximum age at which a person is still considered to be a juvenile , the existence of special courts and procedures , the laws governing procedures against juveniles and how all these special arrangements for juveniles take account of " the desirability of promoting their rehabilitation " .  
On the basis of information received by Member States , the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice is in a position to consider " devising an effective approach that criminal justice systems might adopt to combat the illegal smuggling of migrants , for example , taking more compatible and better harmonized countermeasures , in terms of policy and practical operations , at the national , regional and international levels " ( E / CN . 15 / 1997 / 8 , para .  44 ) .  
These populations , sometimes held hostage by armed groups bent on genocide for which an international criminal court has been set up have in turn been massacred in circumstances that need to be brought to light so that a different future can be forged .  
Whereas during the armed rebellion and aggression against Croatia many criminal acts , grave breaches of international humanitarian law and of the basic rights of the individual were committed ,  
The Special Representative notes that in the past , senior officials of the Islamic Republic of Iran have attempted to distinguish between the act of private worship , which is permitted , and more public acts such as teaching , forming assemblies and working with the administration of the Baha'i community , which were forbidden on the grounds that those were hostile and conspiratorial acts that were criminal in nature .  
The visits to Kibungo Prison and the communal cachots and the discussions with the civilian , military , prison and judicial officials who met with the Special Representative provided valuable insight into the prevailing conditions of detention and the urgency of conducting fair and effective criminal trials for those accused of genocide and related acts .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing and spreading violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are essential to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
The court should be impartial and independent , complementary to national criminal justice systems but not subordinate to them or to any national or international political body .  
While the idea of an international criminal court had been on the international agenda for centuries , the past few years had seen promising developments , arousing more enthusiasm for the process than ever before , as evidenced by the constant increase in the number of countries favouring the early establishment of such a court .  That increase was encouraging , as was the growing public awareness of the need for perpetrators of heinous crimes to be brought to justice .  
It was imperative that the international criminal court should be an organ that was universally accepted by all the principal legal systems as well as all the major geographical regions of the world so as to ensure its effectiveness and authority .  
The discussions of the Commission had focused on issues of priority concern to Member States , such as enhancing the rule of law and fighting corruption , development of the criminal justice system , implementation of the United Nations Declaration on Crime and Public Security , regulation of firearms , promotion of international cooperation against transnational crime , extradition , cooperation in criminal matters , the smuggling of illegal migrants , illicit trafficking in motor vehicles and the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Activities in this field have included conducting and coordinating trial monitoring activities ; providing human rights expertise to the expert team for criminal justice reform ; supporting a project on a judicial training institute ; and conducting a project to provide suspects with lawyers familiar with international human rights law .  
This is a test of our collective responsibility , made even more pressing by the terrible massacres that have characterized recent ethnic conflicts , and Italy confirms its strong support , pledges its active contribution to this endeavour , and is prepared to host in Rome the diplomatic conference to adopt the statute for the international criminal court . 
Over the last six months , we have used this peace-building fund for the following purposes : to provide critical start-up funding for the historical clarification Commission in Guatemala ; to assist the preparatory commission for the establishment of an international criminal court by underwriting the participation of delegates from developing countries ; and to provide financial assistance for the work of the joint United Nations / Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) Special Representative for the Great Lakes region of Africa , Mr . Mohamed Sahnoun .  
Furthermore , in accordance with the collective will of the people of the Sudan , a presidential decree granted an unconditional general amnesty in respect of all crimes committed and all civil and criminal claims asserted during the 14 years preceding the signing of the agreement .  
Last year , the Assembly demonstrated the widespread and growing international support for a permanent international criminal court when it unanimously adopted resolution 51 / 207 , which set mid-1998 as the date for a diplomatic conference to finalize and adopt a convention on the establishment of such a court .  
The experience gained from the functioning of these two ad hoc tribunals has paved the way for the wider acceptance of the idea of an international criminal court , thus creating a firm legal basis at the universal level for the establishment of individual criminal responsibility with regard to war crimes and crimes against humanity .  
Transnational criminal organizations have , in fact , existed for a long time , but the globalization of international relations with regard to the economy , commerce , telecommunications and the rapid progress of technology , as well as the disappearance of ideological blocs , have permitted the activities of transnational criminal organizations to expand and have increased their power to such an extent that they are now a permanent threat to the foundation and internal security of States , to their cultural and artistic heritage and to the environment of the planet .  
We share the basic premise that we live in a world of contradictions : integration and globalization coexist with fragmentation and marginalization ; computer science , while a source of progress , is also facilitating the expansion of transnational criminal networks , drug trafficking , money laundering and terrorism ; greater awareness of environmental problems is not accompanied by the political will to find satisfactory solutions ; and despite the strengthening of democracy , extremely serious violations of human rights continue to be committed .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
The legal system of every State shall provide for prompt and effective disciplinary , administrative , civil and criminal procedures so as to ensure readily accessible and adequate redress , and protection from intimidation and retaliation .  
Despite promises by senior officials that they would furnish to the Special Rapporteur evidence that the State addressed cases of abuse of power and unlawful conduct on the part of its officials , he never received any proof of a single investigation or administrative or criminal proceeding against an official responsible for abuse of power or any other offence .  
Without prejudice to the foregoing , it is essential that the authorities should put an immediate end to all acts of torture and cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and impose criminal and disciplinary penalties on those responsible .  
The special courts , such as the one in Kibungo , have begun operating , like the ordinary courts , which had already been functioning for several months and trying ordinary civil and criminal cases , including current violations of human rights .  
Mutual cooperation and assistance in matters concerning serious transnational crime shall also include , as appropriate , the strengthening of systems for the sharing of information among Member States and the provision of bilateral and multilateral technical assistance to Member States by utilizing training , exchange programmes and law enforcement training academies and criminal justice institutes at the international level .  
Deeply alarmed by the growing violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities , such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals , and by the increasing transnational links between them , and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are required to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities ,  
In view of its coordinating role , the Commission called upon the Department for Development Support and Management Services of the Secretariat , the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat , the United Nations Development Programme , the World Bank and other international , regional and national funding agencies to support technical cooperation activities devoted to crime prevention and criminal justice , also as part of current programmes in the field of good governance and institution-building , utilizing the expertise of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 51 / 63 , reaffirmed the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and stressed the need to continue to improve the operational activities of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme , particularly in developing countries and in countries with economies in transition , in order to meet the needs of Member States , at their request , for support in crime prevention and criminal justice .  
In this connection , the Mission underscored the importance of excluding from the extinction of liability those human rights violations which had occurred outside the strict framework of the internal armed conflict , and the major responsibility of the judicial authorities for complying with the spirit of the law by disallowing an extinction of criminal liability for those crimes which , under domestic law or the international treaties ratified by Guatemala , are imprescriptible or are not subject to such an extinction .  
The reply further pointed out that labour rehabilitation is a compulsory re-education and reform measure taken to prevent and reduce crime and safeguard the social order , and by its nature is not a criminal punishment , and that it applies to urban persons whose habitual anti-social behaviour is incorrigible by other means or whose delinquency , though not so serious as to be deemed criminal , yet clearly transgresses against statutory interdictions and therefore qualified for rehabilitation .  
In addition , legal officers assigned to the investigation teams , with one exception , had little or no experience in criminal investigations ; yet they were charged with the task of advising the investigators on how to proceed to collect sufficient evidence , as well as drafting and defending the indictments .  This process has been corrected by the current Prosecutor .  
On behalf of the Society for the Reform of Criminal Law , the Centre was responsible for the organization of an international conference on the theme " Challenges to criminal justice in a changing world " , which took place at Whistler , British Columbia , from 21 to 24 August 1996 , and examined the challenges posed by increasing opportunities in organized economic crime .  
In the same resolution , the Council recognized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in the enforcement of domestic and international environmental criminal laws , of promoting operational activities in that area , and of protecting the environment not only at the national level but also at the international level .  
In the same resolution , the Council requested the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States in order to determine the feasibility of establishing appropriate machinery for applying criminal law for the protection of the environment , and to establish and maintain close cooperation with Member States and other bodies active in the field of environmental protection , particularly in the area of technical cooperation and assistance , and to continue gathering information on national environmental criminal law and regional and multinational initiatives .  
Israeli environmental legislation consists of national and municipal legislation as well as international law , and is enforced through administrative , civil and criminal measures .  
In this respect , the ultimate objective of the Ministry of the Environment is to develop , in cooperation with the Ministry of Justice and Law and other competent authorities of the judicial sector , a theoretical and practical support structure , allowing for a policy against environmental crime to be developed , in order to enhance the role of criminal law in the protection of the environment and , at the same time , to strengthen administrative measures .  
Israel reported that at the criminal supervisory level , a well-equipped and highly mobile " environmental patrol " , staffed by trained personnel authorized with police officers ' powers , operated within the Ministry of the Environment .  
While it was true that any enforcement of environmental administrative law was to some extent dependent on a general understanding that non-compliance with legal rules will not be tolerated , criminal law should only be applied as an ultima ratio , and should be restricted to the most severe cases of environmental damage .  
In addition to the general problems involved with an international criminal court , the material differences in the environmental law of different countries made the international hearing of environmental cases difficult , particularly with regard to the choice of law .  
The Lusaka Agreement is a cooperative regional arrangement to combat illegal trade in wild fauna and flora , aimed at reducing but ultimately eliminating illegal trade in wildlife species by establishing bodies to ensure effective criminal enforcement mechanisms of environmental law at both the national and regional level .  
At the regional level , it establishes a permanent multinational task force , composed of national law enforcement officers from each party capable of operating across the borders to combat criminal activities committed in the illegal trade in wildlife .  
The combined publication will identify areas where concrete projects in the field of criminal enforcement of environmental law could be developed and implemented , and proposes elements on which technical assistance activities may be focused , such as the preparation of legislation , institution-building , enforcement tools , training and education .  
However , to combat crimes involving , in particular , illegal trafficking in hazardous and nuclear substances and endangered species , criminal law should be used as the primary tool , since penal sanctions , by criminalizing a certain behaviour with a corresponding penalty , have a greater deterrent effect .  
On the basis of both kinds of information , the Commission might then consider devising an effective approach that criminal justice systems might adopt to combat the illegal smuggling of migrants , for example , taking more compatible and better harmonized countermeasures , in terms of policy and in practical operations , at the national , regional and international levels .  
States could also usefully rely on the existing United Nations model treaties on extradition , mutual assistance in criminal matters , transfer of proceedings and transfer of prisoners , as necessary , as tools in improving international cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of cases of illicit trafficking in motor vehicles .  
The Division will analyse and develop as required policy issues in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and produce major reports and documents such as United Nations Survey of Crime Trends and Operations of Criminal Justice Systems , the global report on crime and justice and the international study on firearm regulation , as well as analytical reports of the Secretary-General on the thematic issues before the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and on emerging trends and new approaches to issues affecting the situation in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
Therefore , programmes composed of interrelated and carefully coordinated measures , including administrative , civil , procedural and criminal legislation , as well as various regulatory provisions and administrative action designed to prevent and control corruption , are of high priority .  
Mindful that no one should be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , that such actions constitute a criminal attempt to destroy a fellow human being physically and mentally , which can never be justified under any circumstances , by any ideology or by any overriding interest , and convinced that a society that tolerates torture can never claim to respect human rights ,  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
The members of the Subcommittee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
That strategy was already yielding results : between 1992 and 1996 , per capita income had risen substantially , while rural poverty had declined ; direct elections to new village committees had been held in the majority of municipalities , provinces and autonomous regions and the revised criminal code had established , inter alia , the principle of equality before the law .  
Jordan also supported resolution 51 / 210 , in which the General Assembly had renewed its affirmation that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes were in any circumstance unjustifiable .  
The sponsors and executive entities of , and the research teams involved in , the above-mentioned surveys agreed that there was a need for more coordination and complementarity in applying the experiences and the results of the surveys , in order to enhance the understanding of crime and criminal justice processes at the international as well as at the national and local levels .  
Canada pointed out that , while the idea of an " omnibus convention " on organized transnational crime was an attractive proposition that might have the effect of sending a strong public signal that the international community would not accept criminal abuse of the very positive global trend to loosen international boundaries , it had concerns about that proposal , particularly as far as the possible duplication with other legal instruments and cooperative mechanisms was concerned , at least until the issue of whether such a convention was intended to supersede or supplement existing instruments was clarified .  
Strongly urges all parties in Somalia to respect human rights and international humanitarian law pertaining to internal armed conflict , to support , as recommended by the independent expert , the re _ establishment of the rule of law throughout the country , in particular by applying internationally accepted criminal justice standards , and to protect United Nations personnel , humanitarian relief workers and representatives of non _ governmental organizations and of the international media ;  
Declaring gross and massive violations of human rights perpetrated on the orders of a Government or with its sanction to be international crimes will establish a firm basis in international law for addressing , first , the grave international legal responsibility of the State on behalf of which a Government acts and , second , the question of the criminal responsibility of officials perpetrating such violations .  
By my letter dated 1 November 1996 ( S / 1996 / 910 ) , I transmitted to your predecessor the letter dated 23 October 1996 in which the Government of Burundi formally proposed that the Security Council set up an international criminal tribunal to punish the crimes of genocide perpetrated in Burundi and requested direct proof and circumstantial evidence from the International Commission of Inquiry concerning the assassination of President Melchior Ndadaye , which was " planned beforehand " , and concerning acts of genocide .  
Despite the difficulties that some developing countries had had in expressing their views on the topic , a consensus seemed to be emerging that a permanent , universally accepted and independent court should be established by means of an international treaty , that the court should have jurisdiction over the most serious crimes , and that the principles of criminal law and procedural aspects must be incorporated in the statute .  
An appropriate balance must also be struck between including all the substantive and procedural norms necessary to ensure proper criminal procedure and the need to avoid an excessive level of detail which could impede the success of the initiative .  
Particular attention should be paid to protecting the rights of children deprived of their liberty , to raising the minimum age of criminal responsibility and to improving the quality and adequacy of alternative measures to imprisonment .  
Specifically , the Committee is concerned about the very young age of criminal responsibility ( 7 years ) , the lack of adequate protection for children aged 16 _ 18 , grounds for arrest and detention of children that can include prostitution , vagrancy or uncontrollable behaviour , the possibility of imposing heavy sentences on children and the solitary confinement and ill _ treatment of children by the police .  
With regard to the administration of juvenile justice , the Committee recommends that legal reform be pursued in connection with the very young age of criminal responsibility ( 7 years ) , the lack of adequate protection for children aged 16 _ 18 , grounds for arrest and detention of children that can include prostitution , vagrancy or uncontrollable behaviour , the possibility of imposing heavy sentences on children , and the solitary confinement and ill _ treatment of children by the police .  
The High Contracting Parties shall cooperate in combating crime , especially organized crime , terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , including criminal acts directed against the safety of maritime navigation , civil aviation and other forms of transport , illegal trafficking in radioactive materials , weapons , narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and contraband , including the illegal transfer across the border of objects of cultural , historical or artistic value .  
In the case of illicit transfers , which often rely on criminal organizations , countries should focus on improved national legislative measures and their effective implementation , and on improving international cooperation and coordination to prevent illegal transfers , including customs and police cooperation .  
Against the backdrop of the end of the cold war and the diminished possibility of global nuclear confrontation , the Board discussed the security consequences of economic globalization , the lessening of the importance of national boundaries and the increase in intra-State conflict and illicit trafficking in small arms and other criminal activities .  
The borderlines between political and criminal violence become blurred as precious time is lost in waiting for the overall settlement of long-standing issues which become more entangled as the search continues for a lasting resolution of problems firmly entrenched in history .  
For that purpose , we intend to develop programmes composed of interrelated and carefully coordinated measures , including administrative , civil , procedural and criminal legislation , as well as various regulatory provisions and administrative action designed to prevent and control corruption and bribery , as a matter of high priority .  
In his opening address , the Prime Minister of Senegal expressed the hope that the Regional Ministerial Workshop would focus on strengthening international cooperation in technical and substantive fields , in order to improve the professional skills of criminal justice personnel and thereby enable them to achieve greater success in the fight against organized transnational crime and corruption .  
It was also recommended that the indicative list of criminal activities contained in article 1 of the draft framework convention should be supplemented with the following crimes : trafficking in illegal migrants ; extortion ; kidnapping ; cattle-rustling ; export of toxic wastes ; illicit export of precious raw materials ; trafficking in protected species ; international fraud ; sexual exploitation of children ; trafficking in human organs ; and violation of intellectual property rights .  
In the light of these facts , the Government of Cuba issued a denunciation , through the diplomatic channel , with a view to alerting the international community and international public opinion to what it considered to be a new campaign , developed in complete silence and complicity and aimed at tightening even further the iron-clad and criminal economic , commercial and blockade which the United States has maintained against Cuba for 37 years . 
Invites the regional commissions , the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network , government-appointed national correspondents in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice , specialized agencies and other entities within the United Nations system , the intergovernmental organizations concerned and relevant non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council to become actively involved in the preparations for the Tenth Congress ;  
In the absence of ratification making it possible to apply a universal jurisdiction clause to the country where a violation was committed , States may take practical measures in their domestic legislation to establish extraterritorial jurisdiction over serious crimes under international law committed outside their territory , which by their nature fall within the scope not only of domestic criminal law but also of an international punitive system which disregards the concept of frontiers .  
All victims shall have access to a readily available , prompt and effective remedy in the form of criminal , civil , administrative or disciplinary proceedings subject to the restrictions on prescription set out in principle 24 .  
While the Government of Croatia has publicly stated that it no longer possesses a " war crimes list " of persons in the region whose alleged criminal acts fall outside the Amnesty Law , this statement falls short of the obligation to reduce public anxieties by concluding investigations of alleged serious crimes against international humanitarian law with the participation of the United Nations and local Serbs . 
The Special Rapporteur reiterates his solemn and urgent appeal to the Burundian authorities to defer the 38 death sentences and 19 sentences of life imprisonment handed down during the February-March , April-May and July-August sessions of the criminal chambers , as well as the previous 133 death sentences and 54 sentences of life imprisonment , at least until the peace negotiations have been completed and a reformed judicial system , capable of playing its role with complete independence and impartiality , has been established .  
Accordingly , the level of proof the Panel has considered appropriate is close to what has been called the balance of probability as distinguished from the concept of beyond reasonable doubt required in some jurisdictions to prove guilt in a criminal trial .  
His delegation looked forward to the next session of the Preparatory Committee with a view to moving closer to realizing the final objective of establishing a permanent , functional and credible international criminal court .  
Further attention was drawn to the need to establish arrangements for special investigative techniques , such as electronic surveillance , undercover operations and controlled deliveries , as practical tools to penetrate criminal organizations .  
Aass ( Norway ) said that the establishment of an international criminal court would be instrumental in providing a judicial response in cases where gross violations of human rights occurred and national jurisdictions proved inadequate .

Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
His delegation would work towards an acceptable definition of the concepts involved and the establishment of a clear standard of proof in respect of legal persons or criminal organizations , but considered that it would be difficult to reach consensus .  
An independent and impartial court required full-time judges , who should have high intellectual and moral qualities and professional competence in both criminal law and international humanitarian law .  
His delegation was also deeply concerned about the illegal arms trade carried on by organized criminal groups , which increased the likelihood of international and internal armed conflict and resulted in the destruction of national structures and cultures .  
By adopting the Statute of a permanent , independent , effective , transparent and non-selective international criminal court , the Conference would be leaving an enduring legacy to future generations .

Her organization agreed that a strong , independent and effective international criminal court was needed , and considered that the Conference should focus on the three core crimes , together with aggression if it was so decided .  
Recourse to competent judicial authorities , both national and international , to denounce the perpetrators and impose the appropriate criminal , civil and administrative penalties , particularly as provided in domestic legislation and under international law ;  
That famine was not caused by the calamities of nature ; it was the result of a twisted political ideology calculated into a vicious criminal scenario and implemented by those who pursued the authoritarian rule of Stalin 's regime .  
The establishment of this powerful international instrument for the enforcement of international criminal law will save many lives and free society from ethnic cleansing and from the horror of physical and psychological mutilation .  
It identified what changes in the justice system are necessary or desirable to achieve closer interdisciplinary teamwork and a better impact , in particular , maximum sustained functional recovery and minimum criminal recidivism among drug-abusing offenders .  
Pictures of maimed children are now circulating in world media , and when one has learned about these gruesome acts at first hand , it is not hard to understand the strong calls for an international criminal court that are arising out of this situation .  
The Meeting recognized the potential of the manual to contribute to changing cultural , social and legal attitudes towards and perceptions of domestic violence and its victims , which might improve their treatment by the criminal justice system .  
Convinced that existing arrangements governing international cooperation in criminal justice must be regularly reviewed and revised to ensure that the specific contemporary problems of fighting crime are effectively addressed ,  
The meeting addressed the workshops logistic arrangements and its substantive content , including technical cooperation activities to be considered and proposed , and identified numerous issues of criminal procedure that the workshop could address , such as those relating to data storage , transaction and analysis , electronic communications , trans-border search and seizure , mutual legal assistance , human rights and safeguarding privacy rights .  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural ] , administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Follow-up action has focused on the preparation of teaching materials and the translation of the United Nations standards on criminal justice in the national language for law enforcement officials , examining current penal and banking legislation and creating an effective implementing mechanism , strengthening analytical and operational capabilities , improving inter-ministerial cooperation and enhancing international mutual assistance . 
In its resolution 1997 / 35 , on technical cooperation and international advisory services in crime prevention and criminal justice , the Economic and Social Council expressed its concern at the lack of adequate resources , which might impede progress in the further operationalization of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme and hamper the implementation of those projects that had been elaborated in response to urgent requests from countries in need .  
Whereas the national or subnational knowledge base on the organized criminal groups and their operations is growing , there is no comprehensive global overview of organized crime , a requisite for effective international action to counteract this global menace .

Although the Anti-Rape Law of 1997 reportedly expanded the definition of rape and recognized the existence of marital rape , it nonetheless provided that [ i ] n case it is the legal husband who is the offender , the subsequent forgiveness by the wife as the offended party shall extinguish the criminal action or the penalty : Provided that the crime shall not be extinguished or the penalty shall not be abated if the marriage is void ab initio .  
Training : The Special Rapporteur notes with concern the Government 's apparent adherence to a formal notion of justice , as highlighted by the statement that [ i ] n the light of the fact that the valid Penal Code of the Slovak Republic provides for equality of justice for both men and women in criminal proceedings , no special standards for legal procedures and the conduct of persons active within the system of criminal justice that would enforce justice and equality for women have been developed .  
Controlled delivery means the technique of allowing illicit or suspect consignments [ of . . . ] to pass out of , through or into the territory of one or more countries , with the knowledge and under the supervision of their competent authorities , with a view to identifying persons involved in the commission of an offence established in article ( s ) [ . . . ]  [ of an offence covered by this Convention ] ; 1 .  Each State Party shall27 establish as criminal offences28 the following conduct :  
As an initial matter , we note that such a limitation is arbitrary in two senses : it ignores the principle that criminal culpability should be linked with the degree of personal responsibility of an individual and not partisan political factors - that justice is blind ; and it imparts to the notion of " leaders " a meaning that is at odds with the common understanding of the term .  
Provision of valid and reliable data and information , including statistical data , findings and results of action-oriented research and high-quality analysis and updated information on structures and activities of major and emerging transnational organized criminal groups , on illicit markets and on trends and patterns in the trafficking of human beings and corruption ;  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .  
Each State Party shall ensure that , subject to relevant domestic legislation of the State Party , the said legal entity may incur criminal , civil or administrative liability and is subject to effective measures taken as a result of such liability .  
It was emphasized that international agencies engaged in the provision of technical and financial assistance should take fully into account the fundamental role of criminal justice systems in the achievement of social development and economic growth .

The Institute is a public foundation established by a Decree of the President of the Republic of Italy as a not-for-profit postgraduate educational and scientific institution devoted to studies , research and the advancement of criminal sciences in the widest sense , including human rights .  The Institute was founded in Siracusa in September 1972 by the International Association of Penal Law and the City , Province , and Chamber of Commerce of Siracusa .  
The members of the Sub-Committee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .

States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural ] , administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
At its thirty-sixth session , in 1998 , the Commission for Social Development considered that while the primary responsibility for crime prevention and criminal justice rests at the national level , violence , crime and illicit drugs activities are of such magnitude and also have such major transnational dimensions that they require international cooperation and coordination in respect of formulating and implementing effective responses .  
Noting with great concern that many terrorist groups are connected with other criminal organizations engaged in the illegal traffic in arms and illicit drug trafficking at the national and international levels , as well as the consequent commission of serious crimes such as murder , extortion , kidnapping , assault , taking of hostages , robbery , money laundering and rape ,  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
Urges the Government of Cambodia to undertake further necessary measures to develop an independent , impartial and effective judicial system , including the early adoptions of the draft statute on magistrates , a penal code and a code on criminal procedures , as well as the reform of the administration of justice , and appeals to the international community to assist the Government of Cambodia to this end ;

Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
Joining forces was perceived to imply not only developing innovative measures for international cooperation , but also strengthening domestic legal and criminal justice systems by adopting appropriate legislative and administrative measures and upgrading the skills of criminal justice personnel .

Reaffirms that juvenile justice remains a high priority in the work of the Centre for International Crime Prevention and the institutes comprising the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme network , in particular as children and young people , both those in conflict with the law and those in difficult circumstances who may be potential future criminals , are easy prey for criminal organizations closely linked with activities of transnational organized crime ;  
The Committee is concerned that there is currently before Congress a bill to decriminalize domestic violence at both the civil and criminal level , passing responsibility for dealing with these human rights violations to an administrative court .  
Calls upon States to consider , within their legal systems , the development of procedures to serve as alternatives to formal criminal justice proceedings and to formulate mediation and restorative justice policies , with a view to promoting a culture favourable to mediation and restorative justice among law enforcement , judicial and social authorities , as well as local communities , and to consider the provision of appropriate training for those involved in the implementation of such processes ;  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and effective criminal justice system is at the very core of economic and social development and of human security ,  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .

For the purposes of extradition under this article , the offences established in articles 3 ( [ Criminalization of ] participation in an [ organized criminal group ] ) , 4 ( Money-laundering ) , and 4 ter ( Measures against corruption ) of this Convention shall not be considered fiscal offences or political offences or regarded as politically motivated , without prejudice to the constitutional principles and basic concepts of the domestic legal systems of States Parties .  
Controlled delivery means the technique of allowing illicit or suspect consignments [ of . . . ] to pass out of , through or into the territory of one or more countries , with the knowledge and under the supervision of their competent authorities , with a view to identifying persons involved in the commission of an offence established in article ( s ) [ . . . ]  [ of an offence covered by this Convention ] ; 1 .

States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural , ] administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Despite the recommendations to the Colombian Government to dismantle the system of regional justice and faceless judges , efforts are being made to extend this system so as to continue unfair trials of workers , those who fight for the people , defenders of human rights and political opponents ; simply voicing an opinion that differs from the establishment view is cause enough for being put on trial .  This is tantamount to making social and popular protest a criminal offence .  
This is particularly true in cases where terrorist activity becomes strongly linked to illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs , arms traffic , political assassinations and other international organized criminal activity , 40 / or in cases where terrorism takes the form of violent insurgent activity devoted to the violent overthrow of authority - that succeeds in creating a crisis which overshadows public order and destabilizes the Government .  
The report concluded that there were substantial institutional deficiencies and that although further legislative change was required in such fields as employment and criminal and family law , such change alone would not remove the main impediments to the rule of law , which were rooted in the political environment of the court system .  
On a reciprocal basis , States Parties may conclude bilateral or multilateral agreements or understandings whereby , in relation to matters that are the subject of criminal proceedings in one or more States , the judicial authorities concerned may , where necessary together with police authorities and after informing the central authority or authorities referred to in paragraph 8 of this article , act jointly within joint investigation bodies .  
Generally speaking , where an unlawful act on the part of a state authority causes damage to another person ( physical or legal ) , the civil liability for that act is incurred by the authority ( i.e . the State ) , while the public official representing that authority may incur administrative or criminal liability , but may not incur full civil liability except in certain circumstances ( for example , if the damage suffered is minor ) .  
The purpose of the Makobola massacre was to pin the blame for that criminal act on the regular forces of the Congolese Armed Forces and on their supreme commander , M'zee Laurent-Dsir Kabila , as was done recently in the slaughter of six Western tourists in Uganda ; people have sought to blame that on the Congolese State , ignoring the fact that that crime was committed in territories occupied and controlled by the aggressor States and their RCD and Mouvement de Libration du Congo ( MLC ) agents . 
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal persons held liable in accordance with this article are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal or non-criminal sanctions , including monetary sanctions .  
Within its programme on the application of internationally established standards and norms in the fields of crime prevention and justice , as well as the provision of technical cooperation , the Centres overall objectives are to ( a ) promote international cooperation in crime prevention and control ; ( b ) support the development of criminal justice systems ; and ( c ) assist Member States in addressing the challenges and threats posed by the changing nature of transnational organized crime .  
There are reports of illegal occupation of land and property in areas left by departing Albanian and Serbian local residents , as well as indications that criminal groups may be taking control of vacant housing and property in flagrant violation of the legitimate rights of the original owners and occupants . 
_ that free legal and other assistance is provided to trafficked persons and persons in prostitution in the course of any criminal , civil and other action against traffickers and those who violate the human rights of trafficked persons and persons in prostitution , including a temporary or permanent residence permit and a safe shelter ;  
Firmly announces that all foreign military recruits to be captured by the armed forces of the Islamic State of Afghanistan will be considered as criminals and would be directed to the security authorities of the State for prosecution and punishment in accordance with Afghanistan 's criminal code of 1976 , which prescribes severe punishment against those who are committing crimes against the internal and external security of the State ;  
The Security Council 's increased concern for the plight of civilians in armed conflict has been reinforced by the frequent briefings it has received on the humanitarian situation in countries affected by conflict , and is further illustrated by the establishment by the Council of international ad hoc criminal tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda . 
Widespread reliance on information-based technologies has resulted in an unprecedented degree of global connectivity and interdependence , with the result that many aspects of national and international activity , public and private sector alike , theoretically can be put at risk by criminal or terrorist misuse .  
Take note of and adopt sanctions against Rwanda and Uganda for the systematic pillaging of the raw materials of the Democratic Republic of the Congo , which is the real motive behind this invasion , contrary to the false pretext of security considerations which the two aggressor countries are flaunting in their vain , deliberate attempt to deceive the international community as to the real reasons for their criminal enterprise in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ;  
The scope of the Conference should therefore not be limited to criminal breaches of existing arms legislation and export / import controls but consideration should be given to all relevant factors leading to the excessive and destabilizing accumulation of small arms and light weapons in the context of the illicit arms trade , including those referred to in the report of the Panel of Governmental Experts on Small Arms .  
It is now a fully functioning international criminal court , holding regular hearings , with a normative framework completed and in operation and close and productive working relationships developed with international organizations working in the former Yugoslavia .  
The Yugoslav Government and public is concerned , in particular , over the slow and altogether inefficient investigation of daily crimes committed throughout the Province , the tolerant and protective attitude towards Albanian terrorists and criminal gangs , whereby they are encouraged to realize their plan of ethnic cleansing of all of the non-Albanian population .  
A collection of data on the status and implementation of existing multilateral , regional and bilateral agreements relating to international terrorism , including information on incidents caused by international terrorism and criminal prosecutions and sentencing , based on information received from the depositaries of those agreements and from Member States ;  
Public security in the region is threatened by the continued escalation in the rate of common crime and social violence , compounded by regional and international criminal networks .  
It is hoped that these institutions , in conjunction with the National Civil Police , the judiciary and other State institutions and government ministries responsible for public security , will provide an increasingly consolidated institutional framework for addressing criminal activity while guaranteeing permanent respect for human rights and the rule of law , in accordance with the spirit of the peace accords , and building upon the foundation of earlier achievements .  
In this regard , it is also my profound hope that the alarming levels of social and criminal violence will continue to be addressed by Governments through strengthened civilian police , more efficient judicial systems , independent ombudsmen and permanent respect for human rights and the rule of law .  
Enforcement in the Convention according to the latter meaning of the term , and thus establishment of the right of States Parties to refuse extradition on the grounds that the State requesting extradition may impose an unreasonably mild punishment on the offender , would be a risky though progressive step towards limiting even further the possibilities for members of organized criminal groups to find a safe haven .  
Even though existing international law may be excessively rigid or full of gaps or does not lend itself to the formal definition of a criminal as a mercenary , it would be wrong to invoke or interpret the existing rules either in too restrictive a manner or in such a way as to justify mercenary acts and behaviour .  
To enhance the quality of legal services available to defend accused persons , the Rules of Procedure and Evidence of the Tribunal were amended at the fifth plenary session in June 1998 , to require a minimum of 10 years ' experience in criminal law or international humanitarian law for inclusion in the roster of potential Defence lawyers .  
The Ad Hoc Committee , at its fourth session , held in Vienna from 28 June to 9 July 1999 , decided that at its fifth session it would focus on articles 4 , 4 bis , 7 , 7 bis , 7 ter , 10 , 14 ( paragraphs 14-22 ) and 15-19 , dealing with money-laundering , confiscation , extradition , mutual legal assistance , special investigative techniques , transfer of proceedings , establishment of criminal record , protection of witnesses and victims , and law enforcement cooperation .  
Several Member States described criminal provisions that addressed bodily injury , noting that they were also applicable to some harmful traditional practices , such as female genital mutilation .  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and efficient criminal justice system is at the very core of economic and social development and of human security ,  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
These problems , which are linked to the inefficient functioning of the criminal justice system , are compounded by the lack of human resources , the dilapidated state of the courts , and the lack of means of communication , electricity , vehicles and office supplies , and in some cases of codes of judicial procedure .  
We know what these causes of conflict are : the huge gap between the living standards and incomes of different classes and nations ; the exponential increase in mass migration from poor to rich countries ; cultural difference and the conflicts and fanaticism it triggers ; criminal acts for the sake of glorifying or even creating a nation .  
Gravely concerned by the increasing activities of transnational organized criminal groups and others that profit from smuggling of and trafficking in human beings , especially women and children , without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ;  
The participating countries and Region should be encouraged to pass legislation to criminalize smuggling of and trafficking in human beings , especially women and children , in all its forms and purposes , including as sources of cheap labour , and to cooperate as necessary in the prosecution and penalization of all offenders , especially international organized criminal groups ;  
The UNMIK civilian police will provide a broad spectrum of basic law enforcement services , including patrolling , crime prevention , active street-level policing functions and assisting citizens and business owners in rebuilding safe and livable communities , as well as providing traffic policing , border police controls , criminal investigations , security for at-risk populations and interdiction against organized crime .  
In order to achieve their criminal aims , they actively use political , philosophical , ideological , separatist , racial , ethnic or religious slogans .  
One new P-3 legal adviser ( litigation ) , to be located in Arusha , is also proposed to review and analyse all judicial documents filed in Tribunal cases , to carry out research involving international criminal law and national jurisdictions , coordinate periodic revision of the Prosecutors Guidelines and to establish a database of the Prosecutors positions on relevant legal and factual issues .  
Each State Party , in accordance with its domestic legal principles , shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has , in that capacity , committed an offence set forth in article 2 .  Such liability may be criminal , civil or administrative .  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities liable in accordance with paragraph 1 above are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal , civil or administrative sanctions .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Measures requiring financial institutions and other professions involved in financial transactions to utilize the most efficient measures available for the identification of their usual or occasional customers , as well as customers in whose interest accounts are opened , and to pay special attention to unusual or suspicious transactions and report transactions suspected of stemming from a criminal activity . 
Adopting regulations imposing on financial institutions the obligation to report promptly to the competent authorities all complex , unusual large transactions and unusual patterns of transactions , which have no apparent economic or obviously lawful purpose , without fear of assuming criminal or civil liability for breach of any restriction on disclosure of information if they report their suspicions in good faith ;  
Controlled delivery means the technique of allowing illicit or suspect consignments [ of . . . ] to pass out of , through or into the territory of one or more countries , with the knowledge and under the supervision of their competent authorities , with a view to identifying persons involved in the commission of an offence established in article ( s ) [ . . . ]  [ of an offence covered by this Convention ] ; 1 .

States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , [ cultural , ] administrative , technical [ or any other ] opportunities for criminal organizations to commit [ profitable crimes ] [ any punishable offence ] and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
Main objectives will be to introduce criminal mediation , simplify the work of roving justices of the peace , implement an expedient system of adjudication of simple cases , establish specialized tribunals and offices of the public prosecutor for complex cases and promote better coordination between the judiciary and judicial police ;  
The members of the Subcommittee shall be chosen from among persons of high moral character , having proven professional experience in the field of the administration of justice , in particular in criminal law , prison or police administration or in the various medical fields relevant to the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty or in the field of human rights .  
Urges the Government of Cambodia to continue to take the necessary measures to develop an independent , impartial and effective judicial system , including through the early adoption of the draft statute on magistrates , a penal code and a code on criminal procedures , and the reform of the administration of justice , and appeals to the international community to assist the Government to this end ;  
Public official shall be understood by reference to the definition of public official in the domestic law of the State in which the person in question performs that function and as applied in its criminal law and shall include , but not be limited to , any judicial official , juror or lay judge , police official , border control or customs official , investigator , prosecutor or other official with law enforcement responsibilities in the State concerned .  
Each State Party , in accordance with its domestic legal principles , shall take the necessary measures to enable a legal entity located in its territory or organized under its laws to be held liable when a person responsible for the management or control of that legal entity has , in that capacity , committed an offence set forth in article 2 .  Such liability may be criminal , civil or administrative .  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities liable in accordance with paragraph 1 above are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal , civil or administrative sanctions .

Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;

Subject to the legal principles of the State Party , the liability of legal persons may be criminal , civil or administrative and such persons , if held liable , shall be subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive sanctions , including monetary sanctions .  
Measures to prevent the corruption , by organized criminal groups , of public officials and persons who provide public services , such as feasible measures to detect and monitor the transborder movement of cash , subject to safeguards to ensure proper use of information , and to establish sufficient internal accounting controls to enable their personnel to detect acts of corruption ;  
Therefore , private investors , national and foreign , bringing new or advanced technology into the host country or developing original solutions will need to be assured that their intellectual property rights will be protected and that they will be able to enforce those rights against infringements , which may require the enactment of criminal law provisions designed to combat infringements of intellectual property rights .  
Concerned at the uncertain situation of the Centre for International Crime Prevention , her delegation believed that that body should be provided with adequate resources to provide Member States with the technical assistance needed to ensure the rule of law and juvenile justice , and to elaborate model legislation on mutual assistance in criminal matters .  
Transnational crime , which may or may not be committed by organized criminal groups , also constitutes a new challenge to conventional models of the rule of law because the rule of law is based on a traditional framework in which sovereign powers , including those to make , enforce and administer the law , are exercised at the national level .  
There is generally some tension between human rights and the effectiveness of criminal justice systems because the rights of criminal suspects are often protected by imposing substantive or procedural requirements on police and prosecutors , supported by some form of remedy for the suspect whose rights are infringed upon .  
In the strict sense outlined above , the rule of law does not exist as a crime control mechanism at the international level . 3 There is no international legislation that creates conventional offences and criminal procedures applicable to individuals in the same sense as domestic criminal laws do .  
Estimates of the number of militia fluctuate for a variety of reasons : some minor leaders and some of the rank and file are returning to East Timor ; militia are often collocated with local West Timorese and displaced persons , making it difficult to distinguish between the two ; with some militia involved in criminal activity , their identity as a pro-integration group is becoming blurred ; and significant elements of the militia leadership appear to be reviewing their plans for the future .  
Many countries share a common legal definition of what is considered to be an organized criminal group ( for example , a group composed of three or more individuals , driven by the pursuit of profit , suspected of committing or having committed serious criminal offences and existing for a prolonged or indefinite period of time ) .  
Some studies indicate that criminal groups are slowly abandoning their involvement in visible economic activities and are diverting criminal profits towards the more secretive financial sector . 7 This diversion is said to make detection more difficult and the confiscation of assets problematic . 
The entry of transnational criminal operators in the financial world is believed to herald potential disruption , distortion of rules , erosion of ethics and suppression of competition ; ultimately , it is assumed to foster a purge among entrepreneurs , leading to the survival of those more criminally fit . 
It could be argued , for example , that transnational criminal groups that invest illicit proceeds in the official economy have learned from the techniques and the rationalizations of white-collar and corporate offenders , thus being , in a sense , corrupted by the economy rather than corrupting it .  
Related to this assumption is the implicit association of this type of activity with organized crime , therefore conveying the notion that those engaged are full-time criminal entrepreneurs who have developed expertise and accumulated resources in previous illegal activities .  
Therefore criminal groups spread into sectors where the risk of being arrested and heavily sentenced is relatively low , especially compared to the attractive economic return . 15 Responses are advocated that may reduce such normative inconsistencies while reducing the mobility of transnational organized groups . 
Draft basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of gross violations of human rights and humanitarian law have been prepared by a Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / 1997 / 104 , appendix ) and deserve close scrutiny by the international criminal justice community . 
States Parties shall endeavour , in accordance with their constitutional principles , to reduce existing or future opportunities for organized criminal groups to participate in legal markets while acquiring proceeds of criminal offences covered by this Convention , through appropriate legislative , administrative or other measures .  
Other delegations expressed concern that dealing with possession was beyond the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee or that simple possession offences might not be treated as criminal offences ( as opposed to administrative or regulatory offences ) in domestic law .  
The total cost of crime to communities ( in terms of criminal justice , lost property , shattered lives and private security ) , measured as a proportion of gross domestic product , is several times greater in developing countries than in developed countries .  
He is also of the view that the dedicated protection of selected United Nations personnel undertaking operations at locations where intimidation and resistance is likely , would provide the confidence essential for more effective police operations and legal proceedings against entrenched political and criminal interests .  
It has also noted the inability of the judicial system and of the auxiliary bodies responsible for investigations to determine criminal , civil and administrative responsibility in respect of crimes with high social impact and serious human rights violations .  
In the sense of paragraph 8 of Commission resolution 1999 / 34 , the most important legal means concern those arising from penal law as provided for in the Peruvian Penal Code ( Legislative Decree No . 635 ) which permit administrative or judicial orders to characterize and sanction acts as crimes , because it is only once criminal acts are determined as such in light of the facts that an omission to prosecute and punish can be observed to generate impunity .  
On 9 November , following strong representations by KFOR and UNMIK to Kosovo Albanian leaders about reports of participation of former KLA members and potential KPC members in criminal activity , the provisional Commander of KPC , General Agim Ceku , and the rest of his senior staff issued a written communiqu condemning criminal acts committed by individuals carrying provisional KPC identity cards .  
Each State Party shall , in particular , ensure that legal persons held liable in accordance with this article are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal or non-criminal sanctions , including monetary sanctions .  
States Parties shall endeavour , in accordance with their constitutional principles , to reduce existing or future opportunities for organized criminal groups to participate in legal markets while acquiring proceeds of criminal offences covered by this Convention , through appropriate legislative , administrative or other measures .  
The primary question that should be answered was whether existing and future mechanisms of international criminal responsibility obviated the need for an elaboration of f " undamental standards of humanity " , given that non-State actors could be held criminally responsible for violations of international humanitarian law and human rights crimes .  
Significantly , the Genocide Convention makes individuals liable to prosecution whether they are constitutionally responsible rulers , public officials or private individuals and it envisages the establishment of international mechanisms to enforce individual criminal responsibility for major human rights violations .  
The rationale behind the permanent International Criminal Court agreed to in Rome , designed to be complementary to the domestic legal systems of States parties , is to ensure that individual perpetrators do not escape criminal justice where the State is unwilling or unable to prosecute .  
In view of the serious financial implications of the increased and unprecedented number of ex post facto presentations by field missions , regional economic commissions and international criminal tribunals to their respective local Committees on Contracts , and , when required , to the Headquarters Committee on Contracts ( " the Committee " ) , and in order to ameliorate the adverse consequences of this improper practice , the following provisions should be implemented immediately :  
With respect to procurement by field missions , regional economic commissions and international criminal tribunals in excess of $ 50 , 000 but less than $ 200 , 000 ( or the specifically delegated monetary procurement limit , if it is less ) , any such procurement action must first be submitted to the applicable local Committee on Contracts for advice to , and , if satisfactory , approval by , the Chief Administrative Officer , the Chief of Administration or other applicable head of office .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature and are punished by penalties consistent with their grave nature .

We are happy to conclude from the Secretary-Generals report that these advances of democracy have been strengthened in spite of internal social difficulties , compounded by regional and international criminal networks .  
While the United Nations has created a judicial affairs office that deals with the court system , the prosecution service and the correctional system in Kosovo , the OSCE Rule of Law Division which is part of the Rule of Law and Human Rights Department is tasked with developing mechanisms to ensure that the police , courts , administrative structures and other judicial structures are operating in accordance with international standards of criminal justice and human rights .  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and efficient criminal justice system is at the very core of economic and social development and of human security ,  
We emphasize that effective action for crime prevention and criminal justice requires the involvement , as partners and actors , of Governments , national , regional , interregional and international institutions , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and various segments of civil society , including the mass media and the private sector , as well as the recognition of their respective roles and contributions .  
Calls upon States to consider , within their legal systems , the development of procedures to serve as alternatives to formal criminal justice proceedings and to formulate mediation and restorative justice policies , with a view to promoting a culture favourable to mediation and restorative justice among law enforcement , judicial and social authorities , as well as local communities , and to consider the provision of appropriate training for those involved in the implementation of such processes ;

Joining forces was perceived to imply not only developing innovative measures for international cooperation , but also strengthening domestic legal and criminal justice systems by adopting appropriate legislative and administrative measures and upgrading the skills of criminal justice personnel .  
However , much had already been done ( including the review of measures taken to promote gender equality , the establishment of a national centre to combat ethnic discrimination , the development of a national plan of action for disabled persons ) , and Norways labour legislation had recently been amended to make discrimination based on race , colour , nationality , ethnic origin or sexual preference , in the area of employment , a criminal offence .

Even though existing international law may be excessively rigid or full of gaps or does not lend itself to the formal definition of a criminal as a mercenary , it would be wrong to invoke the existing rules either in too restrictive a manner or in such a way as to justify mercenary acts and behaviour .  
With regard to the review and reform of criminal laws and correctional systems , UNDP reported that it has conducted a series of three regional training workshops on HIV law and law reform in Colombo , Beijing and Nadi , Fiji , and supported a meeting on the subject of law reform in the context of HIV AIDS and human rights in Bangalore , India , organized by the Indian Law Institute .

The five _ year criminal record requirement in the Czech citizenship law , inadequate efforts to publicize the possibility of a waiver , as well as discriminatory and inconsistent application of the law ' s provisions , have deprived thousands of Roma previously resident in the Czech Republic of citizenship and its attendant benefits _ holding government office , voting , obtaining social benefits _ and have exposed them to a criminal sentence of expulsion upon conviction of a crime .

In the same resolution , the Council recognized the importance of enhancing international cooperation in the enforcement of domestic and international environmental criminal laws , of promoting operational activities in that area and of protecting the environment not only at the national level but also at the international level .  
The meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m . 1 Mr . YASSIN ( Sudan ) said that his countrys constructive contributions at all the stages leading to the Conference reflected its strong support for the establishment of a permanent international criminal court whose existence would make it impossible for those who committed monstrous crimes against humanity to escape punishment . 
Mr . SLADE ( Samoa ) said that the aspiration to establish a permanent international criminal court had occupied the international community for much of the twentieth century , which had experienced the horrors of two world wars and the atrocities of countless civil conflicts . 
Mr . AL-BUSAIDY ( Oman ) said that he looked forward to the establishment of an international criminal court which would help to put an end to bloodshed and prosecute those responsible for such heinous crimes as ethnic cleansing , aggression , genocide , torture and the forcible transfer of defenceless civilians .  
In particular , he supported the creation of an effective , independent , impartial , efficient , universal international criminal court .  
Mr . LEWIS ( United Nations Childrens FundUNICEF ) said that the establishment of an effective and fair international criminal court would send the unequivocal message from the international community that heinous violations of human rights could not go unpunished .

He welcomed the plan to establish a permanent international criminal court , which should be independent , strong and impartial , and linked with the United Nations through a special agreement to guarantee its universality and authority.It should be created by means of a treaty . 
The community of nations had a fundamental interest in contributing to a more stable world by creating an international criminal court that was independent , effective and fair .  
Mr . PACE ( Observer for the World Federalist Movement on behalf of the Coalition for an International Criminal Court ) , speaking on behalf of the 800 member organizations of the Coalition , said that the establishment of an international criminal court would represent a monumental advance , acting as a deterrent and strengthening national legal systems for prosecuting crimes against humanity . 
Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public , a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstances unjustifiable , whatever the considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them ;  
States Parties shall consider taking steps to reduce to the extent possible existing social , legal , administrative or technical opportunities for criminal organizations to commit profitable crimes and to alleviate the circumstances that make socially marginalized groups vulnerable to the prospect of a criminal career .  
Moreover , the accuseds spouse , legitimate or acknowledged illegitimate forebears or descendants , legitimate collateral blood relatives up to the fourth degree or relatives by marriage up to the second degree and siblings born out of wedlock are not required to testify in a criminal case ( article 201 of the Code of Criminal Procedure ) .  
Reports mention the poor food , the sharing of cells with people who have committed criminal acts , and harsh treatment by police officers ( made all the more easy by the fact that the illegal persons status makes it more difficult for them to gain access to official legal channels ) , all of which has apparently led to the death of a number of immigrants while in detention . 
The Ministry is keen to raise the currently very low level of public awareness of commercial sexual exploitation of children as a human rights issue as well as the low priority given to such activities by the police in view of the difficulties of inadequate resources and their preoccupation with what is considered more serious criminal activity .  
This criminal military attack on peaceful regions , which follows constant military attacks by the United States and the United Kingdom on long-suffering Iraq , is indicative of an established policy of those two States designed to achieve their political objectives , their goal being to violate the sovereignty , independence and territorial integrity of Iraq .  
Encourages Governments to take effective and expeditious measures , particularly the enactment or amendment , if necessary , of domestic legislation to provide appropriate penalties , such as substantial imprisonment , fines and forfeiture , in order to combat all aspects of organized criminal activities related to trafficking at the international level in women and children ;  
Reviewing the achievements of the Committee at the current session , especially the addition of new elements to previous resolutions , he noted that , as far as the resolution on the establishment of an international criminal court was considered , there had been broad agreement on the historic significance of the adoption of the Rome Statute and on the need to embark upon the practical arrangements for the commencement of the functions of the Court .  
This criminal , unprecedented act of aggression , in clear support of separatism and terrorism , has already caused massive human losses and enormous destruction of civilian infrastructure all over Yugoslavia , thus provoking enormous humanitarian suffering .  
He noted that the recent upsurge in transnational crime had resulted in the penetration of central Asia by criminal groups and that the development of effective legislative frameworks and legal mechanisms for fighting crime had become a priority of the new sovereign States in that area .  
The Russian Federation , which was taking strong anti-crime measures at the national and international levels , had recently signed the 1990 European Convention on Laundering Search , Seizure and Confiscation of the Proceeds of Crime and had ratified European conventions on extradition and reciprocal legal assistance in criminal matters .  
Urges the Government of Cambodia to continue to take the necessary measures to develop an independent , impartial and effective judicial system , including through the early adoption of the draft statute on magistrates , a penal code and a code on criminal procedures , and the reform of the administration of justice , and appeals to the international community to assist the Government to this end ;  
Illegal trafficking in and transporting of migrants shall mean any act committed by a transnational organized criminal group for the purpose of procuring the undocumented or irregular entry of a person into a State of which the person is not a national or resident ;  
The two sides maintain that international terrorism , religious extremism and national separatism in all its forms , as well as transnational criminal activities ( such as illicit trafficking in arms , narcotic drugs and psychotropic and explosive substances , and economic offences ) have now become serious threats to the security of sovereign States and to international peace and security .

The Board took the position that issues of criminal intent or misrepresentation required judicial rather than administrative proceedings , with full due process and legal representation for the individual concerned .  
At the other end of the scale , small arms and light weapons obtained through illicit trade account for much of the political , ethnic and criminal killings and human suffering that occur in the less affluent countries of the world .  
The Convention and the two Protocols address sensitive issues and set up a complex normative system on matters such as criminal law , in which differences between national legislations make the drafting of international laws particularly difficult .

As such , the ambitions of his own country and others for the creation of an effective and transparent international criminal system in which it was not simply a case of the strong accusing the weak had been disappointed .  
Stressing that a fair , responsible , ethical and efficient criminal justice system is an important factor in the promotion of economic and social development and of human security ,  
The need for security is likely to increase as local police , advised by IPTF , have begun to undertake robust operations against local and international organized criminal groups involved in prostitution , drug trafficking and illegal migration .  
Convinced of the importance of establishing a restrictive national legislative and / or regulatory framework for , inter alia , small arms and light weapons , including criminal sanctions and effective administrative control ,  
We wish therefore to join the Secretary-General in calling for a culture of protection in our time , based on the elements he mentions in his report ( S / 2001 / 331 ) : strengthened criminal justice systems ; regional approaches to the protection of refugees and to monitoring humanitarian situations that could endanger peace ; greater guarantees of access by humanitarian organizations to the victims of conflict ; and greater participation by civil society , including the media and the private sector , in efforts to create a broad network for the protection of civilians .  
My Government , the British Government , has a simple message for terrorists and those who support terrorism : terrorism , the deliberate targeting of innocent people for political ends , is criminal , and there is no political , religious or ideological cause which can possibly justify the use of such indiscriminate violence .  
Yet it must be acknowledged that the proceedings have already been substantially transformed by the four major reforms I have just mentioned and can no longer be appreciably amended without interfering with the fundamental features of an international criminal trial as defined by the Council in the statute .  
But we have established that both the genocide in Rwanda and the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia were highly organized criminal enterprises centrally organized at the highest level , and pursued with enthusiasm at the regional and local levels .  
These developments have contributed to improving protection of individuals in all situations through , for example , the elaboration of the rules applicable in internal armed conflict , the establishment of individual criminal responsibility under international law for violations of laws applicable to all armed conflicts and the clarification of the conditions under which a State may be held responsible for acts by non-State entities .  
Objective : To strengthen international cooperation and assistance to Governments in tackling crime problems such as those posed by transnational organized crime , trafficking in persons , economic and financial crime , including money laundering , corruption , illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations , as well as to promote fair and efficient criminal justice systems .  
Following his visit to Cuba , he had addressed communications to the countries whose territories had been utilized by the individuals and organizations that , in violation of international law and their own national legislation , had planned and directed , according to the available evidence , a number of criminal acts which must not remain unpunished .  
He wished to know whether the Special Rapporteur was participating in the preparatory regional meetings for the World Conference , whether he had attended the preparatory meeting in Strasbourg and what his relations were with the Council of Europe , which was intimately concerned with issues of racism and racial discrimination .  52 .  Regarding contemporary forms of racism , he wondered whether the Special Rapporteur considered that they were linked with new forms of criminal behaviour , inter-ethnic conflict and economic discrimination .  
The Committee is similarly concerned by the different minimum legal ages for marriage , the absence of a defined minimum age of sexual consent for boys , the very high minimum age for consulting a doctor without parental consent and the extremely low minimum age of criminal responsibility - currently age seven .  
Of the 38 replies received , one , from a Member State , reported having appointed a focal point for international technical cooperation projects in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and 9 respondents ( 24 per cent ) , 8 of which were Member States , indicated that they did use the instrument distributed by the Centre .  
However , the fact that only nine responses indicated that their authors used the instrument developed by the Centre renders those responses of limited value for analytical , comparative or statistical purposes , or for the purpose of establishing a consolidated database for coordination of and information on international technical cooperation projects in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice .  
The form of the assistance included study tours and training and the fields covered were corruption , crime detection , crime prevention strategies , criminal information collection and analysis , customs , drug-related crime , economic crime , evidence-gathering , extradition , financial investigation , institutional structures , institution-building , investigation materials , international standards and human rights , juvenile justice , money-laundering investigations , mutual legal assistance and organized crime .  
The overall experience reported above by HEUNI and the very limited number of responses received by the Centre for International Crime Prevention to the questionnaire on international technical cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice suggest that the establishment of a centralized database is of very limited value and utility , in particular when one considers the overall quality and content of the responses .  
Each State Party shall adopt such measures as may be necessary , including , where appropriate , domestic legislation , to ensure that criminal acts within the scope of this Convention , are under no circumstances justifiable by considerations of a political , philosophical , ideological , racial , ethnic , religious or other similar nature .  
Each State Party shall ensure , in particular , that legal entities liable in accordance with paragraph 1 above are subject to effective , proportionate and dissuasive criminal , civil or administrative sanctions .  
The development and implementation of effective measures at the national level is essential to enable each State to combat domestic money-laundering activities , to avoid becoming a haven for money-laundering by foreign organized criminal groups and to cooperate effectively with other States in the international effort to combat money-laundering .  
Implementation of the objective will result in more effective tools to combat domestic and transnational aspects of money-laundering , with a consequent reduction of the ability of organized criminal groups to derive benefits from their proceeds and to dedicate illicit resources to further criminal activities .  
Several representatives informed the Commission of initiatives taken by their Governments to promote judicial cooperation , as an essential tool to target drug-trafficking organizations and ensure the full implementation of the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 .  [ 1 ] Several representatives referred to the bilateral and multilateral treaties and arrangements concluded by their Governments to facilitate the extradition of drug traffickers , promote mutual legal assistance in criminal matters , including the transfer of proceedings , and counter illicit traffic by sea .  
The action taken in response to that trend included the following : renewed support for law enforcement authorities in combating synthetic drugs ; the establishment of joint agency units ; specialist training for customs and police officials ; increased support for demand reduction programmes directed against ATS ; and further strengthening of treaties of mutual legal assistance to ensure successful investigation and prosecution of those engaged in such criminal activity .  
Emphasizing that at the twentieth special session of the General Assembly , devoted to countering the world drug problem together , States undertook to promote multilateral , regional , subregional , and bilateral cooperation among judicial and law enforcement authorities to deal with criminal organizations involved in drug-related offences ,  
In this context it is important to differentiate between piracy , which is an international crime under international law and can only be committed on the high seas and in the exclusive economic zone , and any other illicit acts or criminal actions committed within the jurisdiction of a State , which are therefore punishable under national law .  
Referring to State and institutional violence against children , which he understood to involve torture and maltreatment inflicted upon children by members of the police and security forces , especially during preventive detention , he appealed to States to punish those responsible for such violations and to take tangible measures to protect the rights of children suspected , accused or found guilty of violations of criminal law .  
Calls upon the Russian Federation to ensure that both civilian and military prosecutors offices undertake systematic , credible and exhaustive criminal investigations and prosecutions of all violations of international humanitarian law and human rights , in particular of those members of federal forces , federal servicemen and the personnel of law enforcement agencies against civilians allegedly implicated in war crimes and human rights violations and to pursue with rigour the cases which have been referred to them ;  
Noting with great concern that many terrorist groups are connected with other criminal organizations engaged in the illegal traffic in arms and illicit drug trafficking at the national and international levels , as well as the consequent commission of serious crimes such as murder , extortion , kidnapping , assault , taking of hostages , robbery , money laundering and rape ,  
Reaffirming that no one should be subjected to torture or to cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment , that such actions constitute a criminal attempt to destroy a fellow human being physically and mentally , which can never be justified under any circumstances , by any ideology or by any overriding interest , and convinced that a society that tolerates torture can never claim to respect human rights , * In accordance with rule 69 , paragraph 3 , of the rules of procedure of the functional commissions of the Economic and Social Council .  
Gravely concerned at the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in women and children without regard to dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards ,  
Urges the Government of Cambodia to continue to take the necessary measures to develop an independent , impartial and effective judicial system , including through the early adoption of the draft statute on magistrates , a penal code , a code on criminal procedures , a new civil code and a code of civil procedure , the reform of the administration of justice and enhancing the training of judges and lawyers , and appeals to the international community to assist the Government to this end ;  
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in species of wild flora and fauna and to illicit access to genetic resources ,  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 3 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in endangered species of wild flora and fauna ,  
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna ,  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 3 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna , in furtherance of the principles of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the bilateral , regional and multilateral legal instruments and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;  
Also requests the Secretary-General to prepare , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing the domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with illicit access to genetic resources and also the extent to which organized criminal groups are involved therein and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session .  
Aware of the adverse environmental , economic , social and scientific repercussions of transnational organized criminal activities devoted to illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna ,  
Taking into account General Assembly resolution 55 / 25 of 15 November 2000 , in which it is stated that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime [ 11 ] constitutes an effective tool and the necessary legal framework for international cooperation in combating such criminal activities as illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna , in furtherance of the principles of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ,  
Requests the Secretary-General to prepare , within existing resources or drawing upon extrabudgetary contributions , in coordination with other competent entities of the United Nations system , a report analysing domestic , bilateral , regional and multilateral legal provisions and other relevant documents , resolutions and recommendations dealing with the prevention , combating and eradication of illicit trafficking in protected species of wild flora and fauna by organized criminal groups and to present its report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its eleventh session ;

I am also concerned at the deterioration in public security , reflected in an increase in crime , in actions by armed criminal groups and in the continuing very serious threats against persons involved in criminal proceedings and intimidation of members of non-governmental human rights organizations .  
Aliens shall be equal before the courts and tribunals , and shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent , independent and impartial tribunal established by law in the determination of any criminal charge or of rights and obligations in a suit at law .  
In view of the likelihood of a hot summer resulting from the criminal actions of extremist elements opposed to increased minority returns and the reconstruction of historic religious sites , my Special Representative is engaging intensively with political , religious and community leaders and police officials to seek a substantial improvement in their mutual cooperation as an essential element in improving police performance .  
It is , moreover , well-understood that the illegal use of force in international relations will be considered under customary international law , international human rights and humanitarian law , the law of armed conflict and international criminal law .  
The mission , composed of representatives of the Department for Disarmament Affairs , the Department of Political Affairs and the UNDP Cambodia Office , visited Cambodia from 23 to 30 January 2001 and concluded that Cambodias fragile peace was indeed threatened by the uncontrolled proliferation of small arms and light weapons , which not only destabilized the countrys delicate political balance , but also contributed to a dramatic increase in criminal activity and the attendant insecurity of the population . 
Urges States to work with law enforcement agencies in designing , implementing and enforcing effective policies and programmes to prevent , detect and ensure accountability for incidents of police misconduct motivated by race or ethnic origin , to prosecute such police misconduct and to eliminate racial profiling by law enforcement officials or the use of race or ethnicity as the sole basis for determining if an individual is engaged in criminal activity ;  
For the purposes of effectively combating racism and racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance in the civil , political , economic , social and cultural fields , the World Conference recommends to all Member States that their national legislative framework in criminal , civil and administrative law should expressly and specifically prohibit discrimination on grounds of actual or presumed racial , ethnic or national origin , religion and belief and provide effective judicial and other remedies or redress , including through the designation of national , independent , specialized bodies .  
To adopt and implement , in the States that have not already done so , the necessary legislative or other measures to establish as criminal offences under their domestic law the illegal manufacture , possession , stockpiling and trade of small arms and light weapons within their areas of jurisdiction , in order to ensure that those engaged in such activities can be prosecuted under appropriate national penal codes .  
To ensure that all confiscated , seized or collected small arms and light weapons are destroyed , subject to any legal constraints associated with the preparation of criminal prosecutions , unless another form of disposition or use has been officially authorized , and provided that such weapons have been duly marked and registered .  
A monthly average of 300 crimes have been reported to the police , half of which constitute cases of theft or personal assault , in particular domestic violence , and criminal investigations have been completed in over 80 per cent of the cases .  
With greater support from the General Assembly and the Commission , the Special Rapporteur will thus be enabled to continue to investigate such phenomena as the role of mercenaries in internal or international armed conflicts affecting the right of peoples to self-determination and at the same time to consider other phenomena in which mercenaries have a criminal involvement , such as illicit trafficking , terrorism and the formation of mercenary teams by private security companies , which use them to intervene in the internal affairs of States with which the companies sign contracts .  
The problems in Africa have only worsened , particularly in the western portion of the continent , rich in high-quality diamonds and in mineral and petroleum resources , which arouse the greed of unscrupulous politicians , merchants operating in the global market and members of criminal organizations who enrich themselves by plundering and smuggling gems and precious stones . 
That being so , although at one time the definition was considered to be a first step , the current tendency is to describe it as partial , inadequate , applying only to international conflicts and inapplicable to new approaches such as the one involving the criminal responsibility of artificial persons ( private security firms ) that hire and employ mercenaries who violate human rights .
