Taiwan is still in a transitional period , moving toward a democratic progressive society . So there are still some awkward phenomena , and not only among civil servants - - the party consciousness of all people is still quite deep .

That he could return to his homeland was naturally some consolation to him in his final years , but it is still a pity that Eight Virtues Garden lost its owner and was expropriated so soon .

"  
This was a time of deep reflection . When I looked at things in worldly terms , it seemed that I lacked nothing . From a happy home , I had no problems with my studies , and in appearance and ability I was no worse off than most other people .

Here their bodies ' movements are lithe and sharp and their feet have an itch to get up and tango .  
And on sweltering summer days , people gather here to enjoy the cool shade .

The Taiwan Strait is no more than 100 meters deep at its deepest part ; if more silt is washed down from the mountains than is carried away by the sea , the surplus is deposited along the two coasts , and more is paid in than withdrawn . Thus the land spreads outwards in the same way that living cells ceaselessly grow and multiply . In this way , with the passing of the seasons , new land appeared from the sea , the western plain was formed , and the Lanyang Plain was born .

Lin Shan-le , who came to Taiwan to live with relatives , and Li Lan , a student at Hsinpu Junior College , praise " 800O miles " for its deep and fertile subject matter and for daring to tackle sensitive issues . That lover of dramas Ma Yu , on the other hand , believes that " 8000 Miles " goes too far in directly judging mainland trends and cross-strait relations . Sometimes , she says , it has a sneering or glibly debasing tone that makes it more difficult for her to accept .  
Faced with a historical and culturat situation of apparent " change and decay in all around , " his section title From Fin-de-si ? cle to Fin-de-si ? cle , and the Four Predictions which he goes so far as to put forward , are actually a sign of his deep sense of sympathy for the time and concern for his faraway country , although this is not necessarily expressed in gloomy , sorrowful language .  
And because Taiwan abounds in tea leaves and has inherited the tea-drinking traditions of Southern Fukien , interest in tea here runs wide and deep . The Taiwanese connoisseur is quite sniffy about his cup of tea .

Right now the mainland economy is heated up , and the financial market has the jitters . Of course private companies ca n't compete with state-owned enterprises which have access to deep and extensive human relations networks , " Yang Donghong observes .

But if a private business goes insolvent , the officer who sponsored the loan will almost certainly be unable to escape blame .  
But what they have in common is a deep love of the photographic image , which leads them to choose photography for their creative work . When their works appear , they almost always break with accepted ideas that a photograph creates a record , is decided in an instant , is immutable and is capable of unlimited reproduction .  
But other textbooks do give a thoroughly positive view of Emperor Yu 's achievement in taming the waters : one first-year secondary school textbook describes how through 13 years of ceaseless effort , Yu finally brought the flood waters under control , and how " while he was taming the waters , he would often pass by his own door without going in . This spirit of selflessness and working for the common good aroused people 's deep admiration . " How do textbooks from the three areas handle lessons on moral character and proper behavior ?  
Comic books are immediately accessible , because they are direct and have emotional impact . This is one of the special features of the graphic narrative .

For instance , to the sound of Chinese flute music they would walk from one end of the practice hall to the other , on the way changing themselves into a seed which pushes its way out of the ground , then sprouts and flowers ; or into a prisoner in a deep dark dungeon who slowly crawls out to see the sunlight ; or a condemned man walking to the execution ground , who is struck by a bullet and falls down , but continues to struggle forward clutching his wound .  
Or perhaps , with his keen memory , was a recollection floating to the surface of his mind , of a battlefield deep in the tropical virgin forest , permeated by gunsmoke , stray bullets flying in all directions ? China soldiers goodbyeAt first Linwang had a Burmese name which meant " King of the Jungle . "  
At that time the pop music market was dominated by Western recordings or by superficial Mandarin bubble-gum music . Yang 's appeal on behalf of " modern folk music " touched a deep chord with young intellectuals , and inspired many like-minded young people to create their own works .

One day she made the mistake of entering the realm of an evil wizard who cast a spell and turned her and her maids into swans . Day after day she led her flock of maid swans in sad wandering through the forest . Only in the deep dark night before dawn did they return to their human forms , and the only way to break the spell was to have a young man show undying love for the princess .  
Yet there is a sharp contrast . Japanese media have long been concerned about cross-strait relations , have deep understanding of the situation , and handled stories in a low-key fashion . US reports , on the other hand , tended to be more provocative and intense ; US reports also used more varied sources and had a more international perspective .  
Kris Chen of the Taipei Computer Association , who is in charge of the Industrial Technology Research and Development Office for the VR Industrial Alliance , argues that these conditions present Taiwan with an excellent opportunity . He notes that Taiwan already has a deep foundation in personal computers and integrated circuits .

Chiang Kuan-feng feels that on this occasion the issuing of invitations was " broad and deep . " Equal attention was given to the central government and the localities ; professional , religious , and social groups were all included ; and even overseas Chinese were given as fair a distribution of RSVPs as possible . As for how many people could or would come , it was hard to say . The only thing to do was keep calling the contact people for each group and ask , " What will your attendance rate be ? "

I just ignorantly followed the tide and shouted the slogans of class struggle . Hence when I was made to bow my head , I could still open my eyes to read this preposterous , realistic book and gain a deep understanding of a wrongful era , and see how it turned the noble human race into a pack of dogs with their heads drawn in and their tails tightly between their legs , pitiful housepets who feared a beating every minute .  
Yet Bo Yang , who was writing a column for the Independence Evening Post called " Dreaming from My Chair , " continued to launch his witty attacks on the government of that era , especially regarding the privileges enjoyed by the powerful and other unfair phenomena , holding that these reflected a dark streak deep within Chinese culture .

At home I also did my best to give my sons a clear knowledge of Chinese traditional festivals , their meaning and typical foods ( because my sons are big eaters ) .  
People are often bedazzled by the earth-shaking " sacrifices " of romantic love , but Ko believes that classical love , which " succeeds " by day-to-day effort , morning and night , is even more special . This is the deep and subtle spirit of " joy without excess . " Perhaps this is why in the West there is the saying , " marriage is the tomb of love , " whereas the Chinese , in a society built on the Confucian moral code , feel that " marriage is the beginning of love . "  
For example , Chef Chen reveals a dish called " Fresh Mushroom Treasure Chest " ( made from mushrooms deep fried in oil to a golden color and then wokfried with lily bulbs and the tender stalks and leaves of peas ) and another called " Splendid Jade Flute " ( made with zhusheng edible fungus , vegetarian chicken , cane shoots , and green beans ) . Neither is difficult to prepare at home .  
Many people were taken by their parents deep into the mountains to be tattooed in secret . The preconditions for having tattoos were gradually relaxed .

The age at which facial tattooing occurred was also moved forward ; many children and adolescents had facial tattoos early , according to their parents ' wishes .  
" At that time , we were only students , but living deep in the mountains , life was so hard for the Ssumakussu people .

Here in Taiwan , however , under the umbrella of the Wildlife Conservation Law , any duck hunting can only be done on the sly . But people still have a deep sense that other countries must be making a better job of things .

Also , from the Eastern Han ( 25-220 ) onward , the political center gradually moved from north China to south of the Yangtze . This geographical shift brought with it a gradual change in spatial attitudes . The limestone geology of southern China has endowed it with many deep and mysterious caves which nature has fashioned into remarkable shapes , and these constantly fired human imaginations .  
Taiwan and Silicon Valley are currently mutually dependent . But Silicon Valley , possessing such a broad , deep and up-to-date technological foundation , is the world 's technology capital . Over the last two spring vacations , Wu Se-hwa , director of Chengchi University 's Graduate Institute of Technology and Innovation Management , has taken graduate students to see Silicon Valley first hand . He reminds the local industry : " If Taiwan hopes to continue to advance , it must continue to import people and experience from Silicon Valley . "  
As well as Chinese stone lions from all over , lions from minority peoples are also here , making up for their small numbers by their distinctive appearance . A pair of lions from Yunnan , as tall as a man , have ears in curly shapes reminiscent of the stylized clouds of Chinese art , and protruding eyes more than three inches long set in deep sockets . The lioness 's long tongue lolls down against the mouth of her cub , which is stretched up on tiptoes to meet it .  
But with something as marvelously complex as the human body , there are always eventualities that can not be predicted in a living will . For instance , when a patient falls into a deep coma as a result of a stroke , the brain stem that controls cardiopulmonary functions may become completely unresponsive ( resulting in brain death ) . In such circumstances , a patient could die in a few minutes or might survive for two weeks , but death is assured .  
" People 's lives were wasted when they were imprisoned for many years here because of their beliefs and political views , " said Premier Vincent Siew , who spoke as master of ceremonies at the monument 's ground-breaking .

The bushy eyebrows are " dyed " a deep green , the large eyes are accented with a deep-blue eye shadow , the lips are painted red , and the ears are pierced .  
The process of mountain formation in Taiwan was never more violent than immediately after the collision between the two tectonic plates . Mountains rose high and fast . Sedimentary rock buried as much as ten kilometers deep buckled at first before further compression sent it deep into the earth 's crust , where a combination of high temperature and pressure turned it into metamorphic rock . It was then thrust upward to become the Central Mountain Range .  
Most earthquakes in Taiwan measuring 7 or greater on the Richter scale happen east of the island , but the destructive power of these quakes is somewhat lessened by the fact that the epicenter is generally located off the coast and deep beneath the ocean floor , where the denser Philippine plate is subducted beneath the Eurasian plate . Earthquakes in western Taiwan , on the other hand , generally occur close to the surface and cause tremendous disasters .  
The Taipei Fine Arts Museum offered visitors a peek outside the mainstream in October , exhibiting a collection of works by contemporary artists from five Central American nations .

With a tone of deep reflection , Mulroney affirms , " Because of him , we 've come to see a beautiful home that we never noticed before , and we 've become aware that it will easily be destroyed if we are n't careful , just like in Nebraska , where tens of thousands of buffalo trod the plains as far as the eye could see , and the native Americans lived by following the buffalo herds that spread out like a sea between the earth and sky .  
" The textile industry has deep roots in Taiwan , and there are many processes to be gone through from the fiber to the finished garment .

" CTI acting vice-president Wu Chung-fu observes that the advanced countries still devote substantial efforts to developing textile technologies , and naturally this is something Taiwan should not lightly give up .  
That Liu Shao-tang 's death elicited such a huge response at a time when all of Taiwan 's media are packed with electoral news in the run-up to the March presidential ballot , is not only a measure of the widespread respect which Liu earned by his lifelong professionalism and refusal to lower standards , but also shows that Taiwan is still a place with deep feelings and concern for intellectual matters .  
On the morning of May 20 , 2000 , the day of President Chen 's inauguration , outgoing premier Vincent Siew , accompanied by the members of his cabinet , formally handed his seal of office to new premier Tang Fei .

Though held late at night , it attracted thousands of devotees . Dressed in blue robes , they chanted the sect 's sutras with deep concentration .  
Pan has spent more than 1000 days in the last six years roaming through Taiwan 's mountains in pursuit of frogs . It 's not just anyone who is cut out for this pursuit , for frogs are especially active at night , when most people are in dreamland . He explores dark forests , deep valleys , and remote watercourses , searching for the 31 species of frogs and toads in Taiwan . He has become the first nature lover to make a complete record of the geographic distribution and life histories of Taiwan 's frogs .  
Ju 's determination made a deep impression on Yang , a strong believer that the mark of a true artist is not to be found in technical skill , but in a person 's attitude . In Yang 's view , an artist must be sincere and kindhearted , otherwise he is unlikely to attain artistic success . Ju ended up studying under Yang for eight years . Yang took a special interest in the country boy with no formal art education .  
I 'm more fortunate than my predecessors because I do n't have to deal with any pressure from within my own party or from powerful politicians .

An issue of due process Q : After George Chang , the DPP mayor of Tainan , was called in for questioning about the possible receipt of kickbacks , many people expressed deep disappointment , and said that the new ruling party is just as corrupt as the old one .  
As well as encouraging the local people to constantly enhance their tea growing and processing skills , he devotes even more energy to managing the " tea culture " to which tea has given rise , including by-products such as tea pastries and similar light refreshments . But far more important , is to draw deeply on Pinglin 's unique and refined qualities as a tea district and imbue the hearts and minds of local inhabitants and visitors alike with a deep appreciation of tea culture .  
The local people have formed a fish conservation team and as a result the Peishih River is now protected . Many prized species of Taiwanese fish are being propagated . In the pristine forests are ancient pine forests with species unique to Taiwan , and the deep blue skies attract waves of students to Pinglin to camp out and observe the stars .  
Niu Gur began drawing " Uncle Niu the Guerilla Fighter " in 1951 . Finding humor amidst the tragic longing for home of the many mainlanders who fled to Taiwan in 1949 and could not go back , the strip struck a deep chord with the public , and sparked a tremendous response . Subscriptions to the Central Daily News shot upward from a few thousand per month to tens of thousands , and Uncle Niu became a major figure in cultural circles .  
Many family pedigrees in the local area also provide evidence of the fearsome loss of life that occurred . The deluge even came to the attention of the emperor himself , who ordered the imperial granary to ship emergency rice supplies . It was impossible to dig separate graves for each of the victims , so they ended up laid to rest in four large pits . Expressing deep sorrow over the disaster , the emperor declared that the " spirits of the victims would all end up in heaven just like the rest of us . "

As a writer for this magazine he laid the foundations for his latter fieldwork and investigative reports .  
The average age of this group of granddads and grandmas was over 60 . With their dark , weathered complexions and cheery smiles , they vigorously set to work in the Huanshan and Lishan Roads area of Neihu , helping local residents clean out the deep layer of mud from their homes . In the evening , they bedded down on the floor in the activity center of a local middle school .  
With the depletion of sea life in the deep oceans , fries , which require the least water of any industry , are an especially important driving force in fishery . In the future , there will be a demand of US $ 2 billion for fries in the Asia-Pacific region . As a result of the collective efforts of the fishing population and agricultural agencies , fries already represent one-tenth of the annual $ 30 billion aquacultural industry .  
If the Ma amendments had gone through , although funding to localities would have increased , the deep cuts to the central government 's coffers would have meant that numerous previously approved ( or even partially built ) local projects such as sewers and rapid transit would not have been able to go forward . The impact would have been enormous .  
Compared to an intense volcanic eruption on land , when an entire mountain turns red and a huge cloud of smoke and debris rises up into the heavens , the eruptions around Penghu were much smaller . The effect was rather more like liquid flowing through cracks . The lava flowed through , covering up the area all around , forming into flat or low-gradient tablelands tens of meters deep called " mesas . "  
Not far off the east coast of Taiwan the continental shelf falls away into an ocean trench thousands of meters deep , so bluefin arriving from across the Pacific have to come close inshore to find shallow waters to spawn . Their newly hatched fry are unable to hunt or swim for themselves , so they need waters that are rich in plankton and have strong currents . The North Equatorial Current and the Kuroshio Current pass by eastern Taiwan , creating an area of high primary productivity .

Similarly , the continued existence of stocks of prohibited fissile material for the production of prohibited nuclear weapons and of the illicit traffic in weapons of mass destruction , particularly biological and chemical weapons , remains a source of deep concern and threatens the stability and security of countries and entire regions .  
The Commission noted with interest that the democratic transition process in Equatorial Guinea had led to the holding of the first multi _ party legislative elections in 1993 , the first multi _ party municipal elections in 1995 and the first multi _ candidate presidential election in February 1996 ( para . 3 ) , although it expressed its deep concern at the fact that the presidential election had not guaranteed transparency and had not allowed the proper participation of all the political forces ( para .  4 ) .  
A deep understanding of the effects on the physical , mental and psychological health of children who are the subject of commercial sexual exploitation would also underscore the importance and the desirability of preventive rather than remedial measures .  
The Special Rapporteur ventures to remind them that there can be no lasting peace in Burundi until an equitable solution is found to the crucial problem of power _ sharing between the minority and majority on a concrete and realistic basis , providing the minority with sound and genuine guarantees and ensuring that the rights of the majority are firmly respected , in order to overcome the deep _ rooted socio _ economic inequalities from which Burundi society continues to suffer .  
Disturbed by the widespread occurrence in many parts of the world of violent conflicts engendering ethnic or religious hostility , and convinced that the implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , together with other relevant instruments , is the best approach for resolving such conflicts peacefully , the Sub _ Commission in its resolution 1996 / 17 expressed its deep appreciation to the Working Group and called on the Commission to extend its mandate for another two years .  
The participants expressed deep concern at the aggravation of the situation of organized transnational crime , including illicit drug trafficking , corruption and money-laundering , experienced throughout the region and emphasized the threat posed by those forms of criminal activity to government structures and democratic institutions and to the population in general .  
It becomes more sensitive and complicated when it relates to the city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif Jerusalem which has a unique political status and represents the spiritual patrimony of three religions and is closely linked to deep religious feelings in the Islamic world .  
Costa Rica , true to the traditional principles of its foreign policy , has always expressed its firm and determined support for the peace process and , in the context of its deep feelings of friendship for and solidarity with all the peoples of that region , reiterates that peace , stability and reconciliation in the Middle East should be based on faithful compliance with the Oslo accords .  
Expresses its deep concern at the intense suffering of the victims of genocide and crimes against humanity , recognizes the ongoing suffering of their survivors , particularly the extremely high number of traumatized children and women victims of rape and sexual violence , and urges the international community to provide adequate assistance to them and to note the priorities identified by the Government of Rwanda in this area ;  
In the statement at its fifty _ second session , the Commission expressed its deep concern that the disproportionate use of force by the Russian Federation armed forces was continuing to lead to grave violations of human rights , as well as of international humanitarian law .  
Expresses its deep appreciation to the Government of Guatemala and URNG for their extraordinary efforts in concluding the Peace negotiations in 1996 , to the moderator appointed by the Secretary _ General for his invaluable contribution , to the Group of Friendly Countries for their efforts in advancing the Peace process and bringing it to a successful conclusion and to the Civil _ Society Assembly for its valuable contribution to the drawing up of the agreements signed ;  
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
To that end , two fundamental tasks will need to be carried out during the second stage , namely , the deep drilling survey , so as to gain more information about the subsoil of the deep areas of the strait , and additional studies , at the level of the detailed preliminary project , of the reconnaissance gallery envisaged in the basic option .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 10 , expressed its deep concern at the growing manifestations of racism , xenophobia and other forms of discrimination and inhuman or degrading treatment directed against migrant workers in different parts of the world and decided , in view of the scope and seriousness of the problem , to devote close attention to the protection of migrant workers and members of their families at its forty _ ninth session .  
At its forty-fourth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1992 / 29 , expressed its deep appreciation to the Special Rapporteur , Mr . Danilo T \ x { e16c } k , for his final report on the realization of economic , social and cultural rights , endorsed the recommendations contained in paragraphs 202 to 246 of that report and requested the Secretary-General to ensure the widest possible distribution of the reports of the Special Rapporteur .  
We firmly believe that the meeting of the two leaders would signal the start of the necessary process of healing the deep psychological and political trauma left by more than 20 years of bitter internal conflict .  
In closing , on a personal note , allow me not only to thank you , Mr . President , for your excellent leadership of the Council \ x { e5b8 } deliberations over the course of this busy month , but also to express my country \ x { e5b8 } deep appreciation for your extraordinary contribution to the United Nations over the five years you have represented Sweden so effectively among us .  
Essentially a product of deep social and economic underdevelopment , crises in that part of the world are aggravated by ethnic , cultural and religious factors , all deeply rooted in history .  
The role and functions of the United Nations in international economic and social cooperation , as defined in the Charter and as further elaborated in various international agreements , including in the outcomes of major United Nations conferences , range wide and deep and should be fulfilled .  
The Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the General Secretary of NLD in her compound .  
Noting with deep concern the human rights violations and breaches of international humanitarian law outlined in Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997 / 59 , including the aerial bombardment of civilians , slavery , slave trade , extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly ,  
Expresses deep concern at the serious , widespread and continuing human rights violations in the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings and summary executions ; detentions without due process ; violations of the rights of women and children ; forced displacement of persons , enforced or involuntary disappearances ; torture and other forms of cruel and unusual punishment ; slavery , practices similar to slavery and forced labour ; denial of the freedoms of expressions , association and peaceful assembly ; and discrimination based on religion ;  
The Government of Sweden warmly welcomes the draft revised basic principles and guidelines on the right to reparation for victims of [ gross ] violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and wishes to express its deep appreciation of the dedicated work performed by the former Special Rapporteur , Mr . Theo van Boven .  
Its major commercial applications included coastal zone and environmental monitoring , marine navigation , offshore oil and gas operation , natural disaster mitigation and coastal and deep ocean fishing .  
We make these appeals not as an annual ritual but because of our deep conviction that the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , will go a long way to promote international peace and security , a principal purpose for which this Organization was established .  
Like other members , I noted with particular interest that President Clinton first at the Waldorf Astoria hotel on the evening of 21 September , then the following day in this Hall forcefully and germanely stressed the need for the United Nations to ensure that the globalization of the economy does not create deep disparities between rich and poor and that it establishes innovative partnerships between the private sector , non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
We note that , unfortunately , our neighbour , Turkey , is indulging in dangerous policies that run counter to the deep historical , religious and human relations between Iraq and Turkey . Turkey has repeatedly continued to violate our sovereignty , interfere in our internal affairs and invade our territory , on the basis of flimsy pretexts .  
He also affirmed that Iraq would reciprocate each step taken by Iran in this regard by taking two balanced steps : one corresponding to the Iranian step and another in line with our deep sense of humanitarian , regional and international responsibility to encourage the taking of successive , continual steps to ensure that regional security , mutual respect and balanced interests rest firmly on their proper foundation in such a way that benefits the peoples of the region .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
When barriers are erected against immigrants , or deep cuts are made in welfare budgets , or programmes intended to encourage the social integration of minorities are dismantled , all with complete sang _ froid and disdain for the human condition , and when the most basic rights to education and health denied to the children of immigrants , as Act No . 187 of the State of California in the United States would do , these practices are becoming institutionalized .  
Expressing deep concern at the detrimental impact of unauthorized fishing in areas under national jurisdiction , where the overwhelming proportion of the global fish catch is harvested , on the sustainable development of the world 's fishery resources and on the food security and economies of many States , particularly developing States ,  
In most countries with nuclear programmes , the preferred method for the disposal of long-lived radioactive wastes is its long-term isolation in a system of multiple barriers located in deep and stable geological formations .  
Pursuant to my letter to you dated 19 January 1997 concerning the forcible transfer and deportation of the civilian population of the districts north of Kabul ( S / 1997 / 54 , annex ) , I inform you with deep sorrow that the inhuman practice of mass deportation of ethnic Tajik residing in the districts north of Kabul is being continued by the Taliban mercenaries .  
In this regard , the Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating at the end of September 1996 in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the Secretary _ General of the NLD in her compound .  
Aside from the emotional and psychological effects of deep and prolonged grief exacerbated by the continuing uncertainty over the fate of their loved ones , there are often substantial socio-economic effects borne especially by dependent women .  
In most countries with nuclear programmes , the preferred method for the disposal of long-lived radioactive waste is its long-term isolation in a system of multiple barriers located in deep and stable geological formations .  
I am delighted to see you in the Chair of this distinguished assembly , as the representative of a country with which Italy has maintained , through centuries , deep relations of cooperation and cultural exchanges of which I , myself , had the privilege , in a previous professional experience , to be a witness and a promoter . 
Expresses its deep appreciation to the Government of Guatemala and URNG for their extraordinary efforts in concluding the Peace negotiations in 1996 , to the moderator appointed by the Secretary _ General for his invaluable contribution , to the Group of Friendly Countries for their efforts in advancing the Peace process and bringing it to a successful conclusion and to the Civil _ Society Assembly for its valuable contribution to the preparation of the agreements signed ;  
Expresses its deep concern at continued serious human rights violations by the Government of the Sudan , including extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions without due process , enforced or involuntary disappearances , violations of the rights of women and children , slavery and slavery _ like practices , forced displacement of persons and systematic torture , and denial of the freedoms of religion , expression , association and peaceful assembly , and emphasizes that it is essential to put an end to violations of human rights in the Sudan ;  
The role and functions of the United Nations in international economic and social cooperation , as defined in the Charter and as further elaborated in various international agreements , including in the outcomes of major United Nations conferences , range wide and deep and should be fulfilled .  233 .  Among the key characteristics of the United Nations are its universal membership and comprehensive mandate .  
We need solutions that can be attained only with deep and enlightened research and that are based on scientific fact , solutions that aim to be balanced and that take into consideration the international economic system and the interests of the economies of the developing countries in particular .  
Expresses its deep appreciation to the Working Group on Indigenous Populations and in particular to its Chairperson _ Rapporteur , Ms . Erica _ Irene Daes , for the important and constructive work accomplished during its fifteenth session ; 2 .  Requests the Secretary _ General to transmit the report of the Working Group on its fifteenth session to indigenous organizations , Governments and intergovernmental and non _ governmental organizations concerned , as well as to all thematic rapporteurs , special representatives , independent experts and working groups ;  
The Forum recognized and endorsed the deep concerns regarding the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on rising sea levels and changing weather patterns on all Forum members , especially low-lying island nations , as recorded in the Statement on Climate Change and Sea Level Rise issued by the seventh Economic Summit of Smaller Island States Leaders held in Rarotonga on 12 and 13 September 1997 .  
The expert group expressed deep concern about the potential adverse effects of coercive economic measures on the structure of international relations , in particular in the area of trade and development .  
The Angolan economy continued to show signs of deep stagnation : foreign receipts from oil have been declining , public budget allocations have been revised downward and public domestic debt has increased .  
It also gives me pleasure to convey my warm gratitude and deep appreciation to the Secretary-General , His Excellency Mr . Boutros Boutros-Ghali , for the positions he has taken and for his constant and devoted endeavours to advance the cause of the Palestinian people and to support its strategic choice with regard to the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in our region .  
Expresses its deep concern at the prolonged political stalemate , which presents considerable risks for democracy , economic and social development and respect for human rights , and in this regard urges the authorities and political leaders to continue their efforts to resolve the crisis so that the appointment of a Prime Minister may be ratified by the Parliament without further delay ;  
In the light of the provisions and principles of the Convention , especially the principles of the best interests of the child ( art . 3 ) and the right to life , survival and development ( art . 6 ) , the Committee expressed its deep concern at the early legal minimum age of voluntary enlistment into the armed forces and recommended that the State party raise the age in the light of international human rights and humanitarian law .  
Expresses its deep concern at the lack of progress in investigating the downing of the two aircraft chartered by the United Nations and the loss under suspicious circumstances of other commercial aircraft over UNITA controlled areas , and reiterates its call upon all concerned , especially UNITA , to cooperate fully with and to facilitate an immediate and objective international investigation of these incidents ;  
Expresses its deep concern at the lack of progress in investigating the downing of the two aircraft chartered by the United Nations and the loss under suspicious circumstances of other commercial aircraft over UNITA controlled areas , and reiterates its call upon all concerned , especially UNITA , to cooperate fully with and to facilitate an immediate and objective international investigation of these incidents ;  
In fact , contrary to expectations based on previous studies , the deep drilling survey brought to light unexpected geological problems regarding the thickness of the Quaternary filling in the subsoil of the strait .  
The right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the childs physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development , and expresses deep concern about the number of children living below these standards and infant and child mortality due to preventable diseases , all over the world , in particular in the developing countries ;  
Expresses deep concern at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence , in particular against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system , essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ;  
Takes note of the encouraging signs in the struggle against impunity and for the promotion of human rights on the part of the Government of Burundi ; but expresses its deep concern at the violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , in particular reports of massacres , enforced or involuntary disappearances , and arbitrary arrests and detention ;  
Expresses deep concern at reports of arbitrary and summary executions , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and violence , in particular against women and children , and at the absence of an effective judicial system , essential to ensure the right to a fair trial in accordance with international standards ;  
The right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child 's physical , mental , spiritual , moral and social development , and expresses deep concern about the number of children living below these standards and infant and child mortality due to preventable diseases , all over the world , in particular in the developing countries ;  
This would seem to suggest that Governments may follow one of two paths to development , the first encompassing a vision of a free trade economy with heavy reliance on foreign investment and foreign technology , and the other centring on a vision of a deep and diverse industrial sector with predominantly nationally owned enterprises capable of autonomous innovation .  
They also have to overcome such institutional constraints as less liquid and deep financial markets , less developed venture capital networks , less flexible corporate structures and a higher degree of government regulation in certain areas ( such as telecommunications ) . 
The proceedings of the workshop , which contain detailed presentations on past and current environmental studies related to deep seabed mining , as well as papers and discussions on the biological , chemical and physical environment of the seabed , will be published during 1999 .  
The Advisory Group wishes to express its deep gratitude to all the entities at the multilateral and bilateral levels involved in assisting Haiti in completing its task , in particular the World Bank , the office of the representative of the Secretary-General in Haiti , and the office of the resident coordinator in Haiti .  
Similarly , the ILO / UNESCO recommendation concerning the Status of Teachers states in its Guiding Principles that education from the earliest school years should be directed to the all _ round development of the human personality and to the spiritual , moral , social , cultural and economic progress of the community , as well as to the inculcation of deep respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .  
The proceedings of the workshop , containing detailed presentations on past and current environmental studies related to deep seabed mining as well as papers and discussions on the biological , chemical and physical environment of the seabed , will be published during 1999 .  
The objective of the meeting was to formulate an environmental studies model to encourage cooperation among States , national scientific institutions , the registered pioneer investors and potential contractors in research on environmental predictions for deep seabed mining .  
Ambassador Moher arrived four years ago , at a crucial time , when the negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear test _ ban treaty were entering their final stage , and he injected into our deliberations a remarkable blend of deep knowledge of the issues under negotiation , an ingredient of iron _ clad logic and a special ability to build bridges between opposing views .  
" The Security Council expresses its deep concern at the deteriorating political , military and humanitarian situation in Angola , at the suffering of the people and at the dramatic increase in the number of internally displaced persons , which has now reached well over two-million people , not including the unknown number of internally displaced persons in areas which are currently inaccessible to humanitarian agencies .  
The Assembly expressed deep concern at the continued plight of unaccompanied minors , emphasizing the urgent need for early identification and for timely , detailed and accurate information on their number and whereabouts .  
Charg d'affaires a.i . The Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries ( CPLP ) expresses its deep appreciation for the exemplary and democratic manner in which the people of East Timor exercised their right to choose their own future through the popular consultation that took place on 30 August 1999 , the results of which have unequivocally expressed the option of this brotherly people for national independence . 
She also condemned the grave human rights violations suffered by Serbs , Roma and others , expressing deep concern over the mass exodus of 150,000 Serbs from Kosovo , who join more than half a-million Serb refugees in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina enduring deprivation and an uncertain future in Serbia .  
Expressing its deep concern at the erosion in respect for international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law and principles during armed conflict , in particular deliberate acts of violence against all those protected under such law , and expressing also its concern at the denial of safe and unimpeded access to people in need ,

Reiterating its deep concern over the continuing violations of international humanitarian law and of human rights , particularly discrimination against women and girls , and over the significant rise in the illicit production of opium , and stressing that the capture by the Taliban of the Consulate-General of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the murder of Iranian diplomats and a journalist in Mazar-e-Sharif constituted flagrant violations of established international law ,

Expresses deep concern about the reported extensive campaign of wiretapping against the independent media and opposition political figures , and calls upon the Government of the Republic of Croatia to ensure that the media and opposition political figures and parties are not harassed or hindered in their actions or intimidated by government actions and are guaranteed the same protections as representatives of the media or political establishment who are favourable to the Government ;  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
One of his Governments key priorities was to put an end to the social and economic disadvantage faced by its indigenous people and , to that end , in August 1999 Parliament had passed an historic motion of reconciliation expressing deep regret at the injustices and trauma inflicted on the indigenous people and reaffirming a commitment to reconciliation as an important national priority .  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
The Council reaffirms its resolve and determination to face the challenges and to overcome them with a deep sense of faith in God and an unshakeable confidence in the capability and potential of its people and of their union to achieve their hopes and aspirations for a resplendent future of comprehensive , sustainable development safeguarded by social justice and abounding in prosperity and growth .  
Stressing the importance of adherence to international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law in order to avert mass exoduses and to protect refugees and internally displaced persons , and expressing its deep concern at the lack of respect for those laws and principles , especially during armed conflict , including the denial of safe and unimpeded access to the displaced ,

Expresses deep concern about the reported extensive campaign of wiretapping against the independent media and opposition political figures , and calls upon the Government of the Republic of Croatia to ensure that the media and opposition political figures and parties are not harassed or hindered in their actions or intimidated by government actions and are guaranteed the same protections as representatives of the media or political establishment who are favourable to the Government ;  
Reaffirming its deep concern at the tremendous humanitarian problem caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded devices that have serious and lasting social and economic consequences for the populations of mine-infested countries and constitute an obstacle to the return of refugees and other displaced persons , to humanitarian aid operations and to reconstruction and economic development , as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions ,  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and property worldwide , in particular in vulnerable societies lacking adequate capacity to mitigate effectively long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences of natural disasters ;  
The Republic of China a democratic country concerned with safeguarding and promoting human rights , a world economic Power recognized by nations , and , last but not least , a nation that maintains trade relations through commercial delegations shares with deep conviction our common faith in the noble ideals of peace , solidarity and cooperation enshrined in the Charter .  
Because of this situation , the world has witnessed a series of deep and rapid-moving changes that have led to the emergence of many areas of political and military conflicts with dangerous consequences reflected in the human , economic and social conditions of many regions in the world .  
I have been struck by the deep historical resonances of this process , for when the United Nations was established at the end of the Second World War , part of its rationale as an organization was to have been the impartial and objective resolution of international problems , free of the old cycles of retribution through resort to aggression .  
In this respect , we wish to recall the final document adopted at the Non-Aligned Movement summit held in Durban , South Africa , which expressed deep concern over the widening of , the extraterritorial nature of the embargo against Cuba and over continuous new legislative measures geared to intensifying it .  
This shows not only our deep understanding of the importance of this Treaty , but also our desire to make a real contribution towards resolving the problems of nuclear non-proliferation , improving the ecological condition of the planet and strengthening global security and regional stability .  
The League of Arab States was a participant in regional and international preparatory meetings relating to population issues , which demonstrates our deep interest in this subject and our conviction that it is the role of mankind to work towards social development and to participate in political and national security affairs whether in our region or in the world at large .  
We must express , however , our deep concern that , while at the national level the small island developing States have seriously demonstrated their resolve to implement the Barbados Programme of Action , as they agreed to do five years ago , the adequate and predictable financial resources that the international community pledged to provide to support the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action have not been fully provided .  
The Working Group expressed its deep concern in relation to the continuing grave violations of womens human rights , including civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights , and the persistent and pervasive discrimination against women .  
As my delegation has stated on various occasions , including during the general debate in this Committee , we share the deep concern of the international community over the scourge of anti-personnel landmines , which not only inflict great suffering and death on innocent civilians , especially children , but also pose a tremendous obstacle to the economic and social development and reconstruction of affected regions .  
Mr . GOOSEN ( South Africa ) : It is obviously with deep regret that we hear today that the Conference on Disarmament , which is defined as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the international community and which has the primary role in substantive negotiations on priority questions of disarmament , remains unable to reach a consensus on the establishment of a mechanism to deliberate on the issue of nuclear disarmament .  
Takes note of the encouraging signs in the struggle against impunity and for the promotion of human rights on the part of the Government of Burundi ; but expresses its deep concern at the violations of human rights and of international humanitarian law , in particular reports of massacres , enforced or involuntary disappearances , and arbitrary arrests and detention ;  
Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , resulting in massive losses of life and long-term negative social , economic and environmental consequences on vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
Stressing the importance of adherence to international humanitarian , human rights and refugee law in order to avert mass exoduses and to protect refugees and internally displaced persons , and expressing its deep concern at the lack of respect for these laws and principles , especially during armed conflict , including the denial of safe and unimpeded access to the displaced ,  
Egypt views with grave concern and deep regret the continued reluctance among some of the adamant supporters of the Register to engage themselves in genuine and sincere efforts directed towards achieving comprehensive transparency.It is now apparent that ulterior motives and interests of certain groups are involved .  
They include improved market access , deep and broader debt relief , foreign direct investment and other capital inflows , and financial and technical support in the multilateral trading system .  
The safe , voluntary and dignified return of refugees and displaced persons is essential to reverse the consequences of ethnic cleansing and to heal , as far as possible , the deep and festering wounds that it caused during the long years of war .  
In those days of deep crisis , Pakistan extended moral , political , financial , technical and material support to the people of that country in defence of international law and morality as a sign of our solidarity with them in the hour of suffering .  
By cutting deep into all sectors of society , it undermines vital economic growth , perhaps reducing future national gross domestic product size in the region by a third over the next 20 years .  
The initial promise of deep , continuous and irreversible reductions in strategic nuclear forces held out by the positive climate of the early postcoldwar years appears to be fading fast .  
He called upon the LDCs development partners to provide substantial , unconditional and untied aid to the LDCs ( commensurate with their development needs ) and to take fast , deep and broad debt relief initiatives , including outright debt cancellation .  
The second point is that my delegation wishes to express its deep concern about the humanitarian situation that the Democratic Republic of the Congo is experiencing , particularly caused by the massive displacement of people who are fleeing violence , the interruption of traditional sources of food supplies , the systematic plundering of the countrys natural resources and the impact of the war on childrens lives , as was eloquently presented by Mr . Olara Otunnu .  
While there is now uncertainty as to how long hostilities will continue , ensuring that aid reaches civilians especially millions of women , children and the elderly , many of them trapped deep inside villages appears even more difficult than before , with both the holy month of Ramadan and the Central Asian winter fast approaching .  
I recognize that it has been very difficult for non-members of the Council to be present here today , in view of the many other activities that are taking place and of the fact that our meeting had to start much later than anticipated , since we had to have earlier consultations , the consultations having proved extremely useful on the situation in Afghanistan . I wish at this time to express my deep appreciation to the members of the Council for the considerable cooperation which the Jamaican delegation received this month .  
However , given the deep concern of the developing countries with regard to their limited capacity to participate in the global economy and consequent marginalization , one of the major challenges in the coming years would be how to ensure that the benefits of the global economy were shared by all .  
He called upon the LDCs development partners to provide substantial , unconditional and untied aid to the LDCs ( commensurate with their development needs ) and to take fast , deep and broad debt relief initiatives , including outright debt cancellation .  
The Special Representative wishes , once more , to conclude his report by urging all concerned authorities and organizations , in Africa as well as in the United Nations , to use all possible means to ensure that peace and security finally prevail and are respected throughout the Great Lakes region ; that all civilian populations in the region are fully protected ; and that their basic economic needs are fulfilled .  These are the fundamental requirements for allowing a culture of human rights to develop and to take deep root in the region .  
Express our deep concern that the socio-economic development of our continent is being hampered by widespread internal conflicts which are due , among other causes , to violations of human rights , including discrimination based on ethnic or national origin and lack of democratic , inclusive and participatory governance ;  
Expresses its deep conviction that a social order able to guarantee the full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms can only be founded on a democratic society based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political , economic and cultural system and on the peoples full participation in all aspects of their lives , and characterized by equity , social justice and non-discrimination ;  
Stresses however its deep concern about the continued repression of members of the political opposition and about the detention of dissidents and all other persons detained or imprisoned for peacefully expressing their political , religious and social views and for exercising their right to full and equal participation in public affairs , and calls upon the Government of Cuba to release all those persons ;  
The promise of deep , progressive and irreversible reductions inherent in unilateral and bilateral efforts remains to be fully implemented and may even be threatened by the unravelling of solemn agreements and treaties which served valuable stabilizing roles .  
In the context of establishing the limits of an extended continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles , the vast non-living marine resources that are known to occur on and beneath the deep seabed of the Pacific Ocean provide further opportunities that could provide the Pacific Island Forum States with an additional measure of economic independence .  
The objectives of the workshop were to provide information on the occurrence , technical parameters , economic interest and potential resources contained in mineral resources other than polymetallic nodules , to identify existing institutional factors that have contributed to the discovery of such resources and continuing research on them and to provide information which would assist in drafting rules , regulations and procedures for prospecting and exploration for these mineral deposits , in particular deep sea polymetallic sulphide deposits and cobalt crusts .  
These assumptions related to the prices of the metals contained in polymetallic nodules , the technical feasibility of mining operations and the need to ensure an adequate rate of return on investment in deep seabed mining and resulted in a model which required each mine site to be capable of sustaining an annual commercial production of 3-million tonnes of dry nodules per year over a period of 20 years . 
In light of these and other available reports , the Committee reiterates its deep concern over accounts that Israels recent actions in the occupied territories in violation of international human rights law and humanitarian law have resulted in gross violations of the economic , social and cultural rights of Palestinians .  
The need for reliable early-warning information and a deep and careful understanding of local circumstances and traditions is therefore of great importance , and the fundamental inequities need to be identified and addressed in development planning and programming .

When we met during the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly , held only four months ago , we all expressed our deep concern that , compared to 1992 , the overall trend regarding sustainable development in developing countries is worse today .  
I should like to conclude my remarks by expressing the Government of Japan \ x { e5b8 } deep appreciation to all the countries and international institutions that are engaged in the noble and difficult tasks , both civilian and military , that are required for the implementation of the Peace Agreement .  
Similarly , the continued existence of stocks of prohibited fissile material for the production of prohibited nuclear weapons and of the illicit traffic in weapons of mass destruction , particularly biological and chemical weapons , remains a source of deep concern and threatens the stability and security of countries and entire regions .  
The Commission noted with interest that the democratic transition process in Equatorial Guinea had led to the holding of the first multi _ party legislative elections in 1993 , the first multi _ party municipal elections in 1995 and the first multi _ candidate presidential election in February 1996 ( para . 3 ) , although it expressed its deep concern at the fact that the presidential election had not guaranteed transparency and had not allowed the proper participation of all the political forces ( para .  4 ) .  
A deep understanding of the effects on the physical , mental and psychological health of children who are the subject of commercial sexual exploitation would also underscore the importance and the desirability of preventive rather than remedial measures .  
The Special Rapporteur ventures to remind them that there can be no lasting peace in Burundi until an equitable solution is found to the crucial problem of power _ sharing between the minority and majority on a concrete and realistic basis , providing the minority with sound and genuine guarantees and ensuring that the rights of the majority are firmly respected , in order to overcome the deep _ rooted socio _ economic inequalities from which Burundi society continues to suffer .  
Disturbed by the widespread occurrence in many parts of the world of violent conflicts engendering ethnic or religious hostility , and convinced that the implementation of the Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or Ethnic , Religious and Linguistic Minorities , together with other relevant instruments , is the best approach for resolving such conflicts peacefully , the Sub _ Commission in its resolution 1996 / 17 expressed its deep appreciation to the Working Group and called on the Commission to extend its mandate for another two years .  
The participants expressed deep concern at the aggravation of the situation of organized transnational crime , including illicit drug trafficking , corruption and money-laundering , experienced throughout the region and emphasized the threat posed by those forms of criminal activity to government structures and democratic institutions and to the population in general .  
It becomes more sensitive and complicated when it relates to the city of Al-Quds Al-Sharif Jerusalem which has a unique political status and represents the spiritual patrimony of three religions and is closely linked to deep religious feelings in the Islamic world .  
Costa Rica , true to the traditional principles of its foreign policy , has always expressed its firm and determined support for the peace process and , in the context of its deep feelings of friendship for and solidarity with all the peoples of that region , reiterates that peace , stability and reconciliation in the Middle East should be based on faithful compliance with the Oslo accords .

To that end , two fundamental tasks will need to be carried out during the second stage , namely , the deep drilling survey , so as to gain more information about the subsoil of the deep areas of the strait , and additional studies , at the level of the detailed preliminary project , of the reconnaissance gallery envisaged in the basic option .  
At its forty _ eighth session , the Sub-Commission , in its resolution 1996 / 10 , expressed its deep concern at the growing manifestations of racism , xenophobia and other forms of discrimination and inhuman or degrading treatment directed against migrant workers in different parts of the world and decided , in view of the scope and seriousness of the problem , to devote close attention to the protection of migrant workers and members of their families at its forty _ ninth session .

We firmly believe that the meeting of the two leaders would signal the start of the necessary process of healing the deep psychological and political trauma left by more than 20 years of bitter internal conflict .  
In closing , on a personal note , allow me not only to thank you , Mr . President , for your excellent leadership of the Council \ x { e5b8 } deliberations over the course of this busy month , but also to express my country \ x { e5b8 } deep appreciation for your extraordinary contribution to the United Nations over the five years you have represented Sweden so effectively among us .  
Essentially a product of deep social and economic underdevelopment , crises in that part of the world are aggravated by ethnic , cultural and religious factors , all deeply rooted in history .

We make these appeals not as an annual ritual but because of our deep conviction that the elimination of weapons of mass destruction , including nuclear , chemical and biological weapons , will go a long way to promote international peace and security , a principal purpose for which this Organization was established .  
Like other members , I noted with particular interest that President Clinton first at the Waldorf Astoria hotel on the evening of 21 September , then the following day in this Hall forcefully and germanely stressed the need for the United Nations to ensure that the globalization of the economy does not create deep disparities between rich and poor and that it establishes innovative partnerships between the private sector , non-governmental organizations and international financial institutions .  
We note that , unfortunately , our neighbour , Turkey , is indulging in dangerous policies that run counter to the deep historical , religious and human relations between Iraq and Turkey . Turkey has repeatedly continued to violate our sovereignty , interfere in our internal affairs and invade our territory , on the basis of flimsy pretexts .  
He also affirmed that Iraq would reciprocate each step taken by Iran in this regard by taking two balanced steps : one corresponding to the Iranian step and another in line with our deep sense of humanitarian , regional and international responsibility to encourage the taking of successive , continual steps to ensure that regional security , mutual respect and balanced interests rest firmly on their proper foundation in such a way that benefits the peoples of the region .  
These should be followed by concrete measures of nuclear disarmament , such as the initiation of negotiations for further deep reductions in strategic nuclear forces , which could be undertaken in a series of phased actions ; dismantlement of weapons that are withdrawn by States and an undertaking not to modernize their weapons ; genuine build-down of nuclear arsenals , an essential component of which would be multilateral monitoring of existing stocks of nuclear warheads ; reduction of operationally deployed nuclear weapons and handing over of the fissile material to multilaterally supervised storage .  
When barriers are erected against immigrants , or deep cuts are made in welfare budgets , or programmes intended to encourage the social integration of minorities are dismantled , all with complete sang _ froid and disdain for the human condition , and when the most basic rights to education and health denied to the children of immigrants , as Act No . 187 of the State of California in the United States would do , these practices are becoming institutionalized .

Pursuant to my letter to you dated 19 January 1997 concerning the forcible transfer and deportation of the civilian population of the districts north of Kabul ( S / 1997 / 54 , annex ) , I inform you with deep sorrow that the inhuman practice of mass deportation of ethnic Tajik residing in the districts north of Kabul is being continued by the Taliban mercenaries .  
In this regard , the Special Rapporteur expresses his deep concern at the continued detention of many political prisoners , in particular elected representatives , and the recent arrests and harassment of other supporters of democratic groups in Myanmar , culminating at the end of September 1996 in the massive arrests of NLD supporters and the virtual blockade of the Secretary _ General of the NLD in her compound .  
Aside from the emotional and psychological effects of deep and prolonged grief exacerbated by the continuing uncertainty over the fate of their loved ones , there are often substantial socio-economic effects borne especially by dependent women .  
In most countries with nuclear programmes , the preferred method for the disposal of long-lived radioactive waste is its long-term isolation in a system of multiple barriers located in deep and stable geological formations .

This would seem to suggest that Governments may follow one of two paths to development , the first encompassing a vision of a free trade economy with heavy reliance on foreign investment and foreign technology , and the other centring on a vision of a deep and diverse industrial sector with predominantly nationally owned enterprises capable of autonomous innovation .  
They also have to overcome such institutional constraints as less liquid and deep financial markets , less developed venture capital networks , less flexible corporate structures and a higher degree of government regulation in certain areas ( such as telecommunications ) .

Mr . GOOSEN ( South Africa ) : It is obviously with deep regret that we hear today that the Conference on Disarmament , which is defined as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the international community and which has the primary role in substantive negotiations on priority questions of disarmament , remains unable to reach a consensus on the establishment of a mechanism to deliberate on the issue of nuclear disarmament .

Olara Otunnu .  
While there is now uncertainty as to how long hostilities will continue , ensuring that aid reaches civilians especially millions of women , children and the elderly , many of them trapped deep inside villages appears even more difficult than before , with both the holy month of Ramadan and the Central Asian winter fast approaching .  
I recognize that it has been very difficult for non-members of the Council to be present here today , in view of the many other activities that are taking place and of the fact that our meeting had to start much later than anticipated , since we had to have earlier consultations , the consultations having proved extremely useful on the situation in Afghanistan . I wish at this time to express my deep appreciation to the members of the Council for the considerable cooperation which the Jamaican delegation received this month .  
However , given the deep concern of the developing countries with regard to their limited capacity to participate in the global economy and consequent marginalization , one of the major challenges in the coming years would be how to ensure that the benefits of the global economy were shared by all .

The objectives of the workshop were to provide information on the occurrence , technical parameters , economic interest and potential resources contained in mineral resources other than polymetallic nodules , to identify existing institutional factors that have contributed to the discovery of such resources and continuing research on them and to provide information which would assist in drafting rules , regulations and procedures for prospecting and exploration for these mineral deposits , in particular deep sea polymetallic sulphide deposits and cobalt crusts .  
These assumptions related to the prices of the metals contained in polymetallic nodules , the technical feasibility of mining operations and the need to ensure an adequate rate of return on investment in deep seabed mining and resulted in a model which required each mine site to be capable of sustaining an annual commercial production of 3-million tonnes of dry nodules per year over a period of 20 years . 
In light of these and other available reports , the Committee reiterates its deep concern over accounts that Israels recent actions in the occupied territories in violation of international human rights law and humanitarian law have resulted in gross violations of the economic , social and cultural rights of Palestinians .  
The need for reliable early-warning information and a deep and careful understanding of local circumstances and traditions is therefore of great importance , and the fundamental inequities need to be identified and addressed in development planning and programming .  
In resolution 1999 / 26 of 26 August 1999 , the Sub-Commission expressed its deep appreciation and thanks to the Special Rapporteur for her excellent and comprehensive preliminary report and requested the Secretary-General to transmit this report to Governments , specialized agencies and concerned intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations with the request that they submit to the Special Rapporteur as soon as possible comments , information and data relating to the study on terrorism and human rights .

Expresses deep concern at the increasing number and scale of natural disasters , which have resulted in massive losses of life and long term negative social , economic and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies worldwide , in particular in developing countries ;  
However , it must always be borne in mind that the task is complicated by the fact that it is not merely a question of combating laws , regulations and policies , but also of combating cultural practices that are rooted in collective memory and in the deep ancestral beliefs of people , including women themselves , and that , sometimes these harmful practices , although often contrary to religions , are perpetuated in the name of religion , or imputed to religion .  
It also noted with deep concern the continuing pattern of human rights violations in Afghanistan and the continuation of armed hostilities and the complex nature of the conflict , including its ethnic , religious and political aspects , which had resulted in extensive human suffering and forced displacement .  
He also stressed that the technology transfer provisions analysed in the secretariat = s issues note related to specific circumstances , as indicated in the note , where a common good was at stake ( such as the global ozone layer in the Montreal Protocol and the deep sea-bed in UNCLOS ) and it was only to this extent that there was a politically and legally persuasive case for asking developed country addressees to give additional incentives for transfer of technology .  
Recalling also Commission resolution 2001 / 31 on human rights and extreme poverty , in which the Commission expressed its deep concern that 53 years after the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , extreme poverty continued to spread in all countries of the world , regardless of their economic , social and cultural situation , and that its extent and manifestations , such as hunger , disease , lack of adequate shelter , illiteracy and hopelessness were particularly severe in developing countries , while acknowledging the achievements made in many parts of the world ,
