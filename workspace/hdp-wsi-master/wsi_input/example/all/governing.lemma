It has further pointed out the direction of party building in the new period and has a high theoretical and ideological level and a guiding function .  
In the march toward the new century , in order to conscientiously implement Comrade Jiang Zemin 's requirement on the " three represents " and " comprehensively advance party building around the two major historical topics , that is , constantly raising our leading and governing ability and improving our ability to guard against corruption and degeneration and withstand risks , " it is necessary to thoroughly implement the principle of strictly administering the party and satisfactorily resolve the ideological , organizational , and work style problems that exist in our party .

During the process of deepening reforms , we must not waver in upholding all the basic rules governing the party 's absolute leadership over the armed forces - - such as the rules on the division of military leaders ' responsibilities and the establishment of political leaders and political bodies in the armed forces - - or rules that the supreme leadership and commanding authority belong to the collective leadership of the party Central Committee , the Central Military Commission , and party committees ( party branches ) .

Nonetheless , under the conditions of the socialist market economy and along with the gradual deepening of our country 's political or economic structural reform as well as the in-depth development of our army building , our present enlistment system governing officers in active service has turned incompatible with the needs of a new situation or a new task in certain aspects , and it is thereby imperative to replenish or amend the " Regulations " in an appropriate way .  
On the basis of extensively soliciting opinions from all parties concerned and conducting sufficient study or demonstrations , the General Political Department has formulated a draft amendment to our existing enlistment regulations governing officers in active service , and the draft amendment has been approved by an executive meeting of the State Council and an executive meeting of the Central Military Commission respectively .

We propose : Sino-US ties should be dealt with from a strategic and long-term perspective , and the differences between the two countries handled in a proper way .

Zhu Bangzao said a small number of anti-China congressmen of the United States have obstinately clung to the " Cold War " mentality and they are filled with bias and hostility toward China . They have ignored basic facts and China 's tremendous efforts to prevent proliferation , wantonly violated the basic principles governing state-to-state relations , and attempted to promote the adoption of the " China Nonproliferation Law " bill as a law to undermine the improvement and development of Sino-US relations .  Their intention is quite vicious .  
Qian Qichen pointed out : During our talks with Albright , we stressed that whether Sino-US relations can be improved and developed and whether China and the United States can establish their constructive strategic partnership is determined by whether the United States follows the basic norms governing the international law of respecting other countries ' state sovereignty and territorial integrity , refrains from interfering in other countries ' internal affairs and truly sticks to the " one China " principle in its acts .  
These principles have been commonly accepted as the norms governing state-to-state relations , and they have played a positive role in the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems and in the promotion of friendship and cooperation among developing countries .  They have also already played and will continue to play a significant role in promoting the establishment of a new international political and economic order that is fair and rational .

Of course , if the targets for expansion of the wild salmon population are reached , there are regulations governing the raising of animals which , strictly applied , should prevent artificially propagated animals from getting mixed into the species in the wild .

For instance , some concepts governing the traditional use of herbal medicines , such as Chinese medical differentiation between " hot " and " cold " ingredients , are hard to verify with modern scientific instruments .  
There are also detailed descriptions of the SEF 's legal , trade and cultural services . The Mainland Affairs section presents the current state of cross-strait exchanges , and regulations governing cross-strait news reporting , publishing and electronic media work . All this information should provide a valuable reference resource for Taiwanese firms investing in the mainland , and for people both inside and outside the ROC who are engaged in cross-strait business or other affairs .  
Meanwhile , the main regulations governing Taiwan 's relations with Hong Kong have been largely completed . July 1997 will not merely be a starting point for Tung and the people of Hong Kong .

An official at the Council of Agriculture , the governing body for wildlife protection , notes that " the Wildlife Conservation Law was targeted at the needs of a specific moment . All law is open to change , and in the future we might permit planned hunting , and also trade in game .

Scholars have stated that the 2000 election in Taiwan has three special characteristics : For one thing , this is the first time the opposition has a very real possibility of taking the reins of government . Secondly , the three leading candidates are so close it is impossible to tell who will win . And third , whatever the outcome , this is the beginning of Taiwan 's post-strongman era .  
Legal restraint involves legislation and enforcement . We must first undertake the appropriate legislative tasks , and amend laws governing political contributions , lobbying , political parties , compulsory trusts , and election rules .

In imposing its rule over Taiwan , Japan deliberately gave concrete forms to its imperial authority , as we can see from many historical documents . For example , there were precise rules governing the number of buttons , the weapons , and the shoes of ordinary policemen . With the adoption of such detailed forms , throughout society a new body language took shape that expressed degrees of authority . You can still see this in the body language of older people .

Dai Jingzhang , medical director of the TCM Clinic , says that Germany has very stringent standards governing the inspection of Chinese herbal medicines .

Indeed , in such cases the legal rules governing jurisdiction would not be applicable , the criminal laws of the State that would normally have jurisdiction might be inadequate or there might be particular circumstances on the ground ( disorganization of the judicial apparatus , partiality of the courts because of internal or external conflict , a deliberate refusal to prosecute or extradite ) impeding the administration of justice .

Through its current operation Israel has demonstrated once again its utter contempt for Security Council resolution 425 ( 1978 ) , as well the Charter provisions and principles of international law governing relations between States .

For this reason , until the new concepts governing economic relations among countries today and democracy throughout the continent are accompanied by investment in social sectors and a genuine modernization of education to help close the gap , the sectors of the population affected by poverty will ultimately reject what we here today quite rightly think should be permanent values of modern societies .

Its formulation of the legal aspects related to the application of the principle that the exploration and utilization of outer space should be carried out for the benefit and in the interests of all States , taking into particular account the needs of developing countries , should consist of a set of legally binding principles governing international cooperation in those areas , rather than be a mere declaration having only political and moral force .  
TAKASU ( Controller ) emphasized that the proposals contained in the report of the Secretary-General ( A / C . 5 / 50 / 30 ) were not intended to change the procedures governing the financing of unforeseen and extraordinary expenses , but rather the aim was simply to increase the annual limit of $ 5 million established by General Assembly resolutions 48 / 229 and 50 / 217 .

In essence , the assumption of all governmental powers by SLORC in 1988 constituted , as mentioned earlier , a break from constitutionality and legal continuity and further constituted a departure from the norms governing the enjoyment of political rights proclaimed in article 21 of the Universal Declaration . There could , arguably , have been some legitimacy in the assumption of power by SLORC , without the consent of the people , in circumstances which could be said to have amounted to a state of public emergency threatening the life of the nation .  
Social consensus and ongoing dialogue are the basic rules governing relations between all the political , economic and social partners , reflecting the recognition that comprehensive development can not be fully achieved until the impoverished have gained access to the essential attributes of dignity ; a goal that can be achieved only by combatting all forms of destitution and marginalization and making enhanced solidarity among all members of the national community an essential basis for all the reforms introduced .  II .  
The revision of this legislation has introduced an essential flexibility in the conditions governing the establishment of associations by replacing the rather strict requirement of prior authorization by a much more flexible and basically more favourable requirement of a simple declaration to the authorities , by virtue of which the association is deemed constituted unless the authorities object within the period of 46 days specified by the Act of 2 April 1992 .  
In addition to the relaxation of the regulations governing the establishment of associations , which has worked greatly to the benefit of learned societies - present in vast numbers in the early 1990s - the State has also encouraged learned societies both by contributing to their annual budgets and by supporting the scientific events which they organize .
