To accelerate the achievement of national modernization , to strengthen comprehensive national capability and international competitiveness , and to meet the opportunities and challenges presented by the new century , it is imperative to earnestly implement the CPC 's education policy , to vigorously develop education , to comprehensively advance personal quality education , and to promote the comprehensive development of children and youths , in an effort to train high quality workers and specialized personnel of various levels and fields meeting the requirements of modernization construction .  
To carry out personal quality education is to rectify such one-sided understandings and practices , so as to train " idealistic , moral , educated , and disciplined " socialist builders and successors who are comprehensively developed ethically , intellectually , physically , and aesthetically .  
Have personal quality education permeate all such stages as preschool education , elementary and secondary school education , vocational education , adult education , and higher education as well as all categories of education , and all such aspects as school education , family education , and social education , so that the different stages and aspects have different contents and emphases but are also closely linked to each other and in mutual cooperation , advancing as an integral whole .  
Beijing has become not only the largest education base nationwide , but also a renowned international education center in the Asia-Pacific region , thereby laying a good foundation for deepening education reform and comprehensively carrying out personal quality education .  
It is necessary , on the basis of centering on personal quality education , to intensify the reform of the school-running system and to encourage social forces to operate schools , so as to meet the need of economic development and comprehensive social progress for diverse personnel and to meet needs of the capital city 's reform , opening , and modernization construction .

Through such education , people should profoundly understand that communism and socialism is a just , inevitable , and arduous cause , understand that the cause of communism and socialism is noble and beautiful .

In Russians , he has left the impressions of a person who " is steady , " " does solid work , " " has an iron hand , " " is healthy , " and " is bold but cautious . "  His election as president of the new century by the common people showed that the common people have great expectations for him , and hope he will lead Russia to a prosperous , stable , and strong tomorrow .  
Various news propaganda units should seize opportunities , and strive to explore and establish work mechanisms which are conducive for us to uphold the party 's basic principle and fundamental nature governing journalistic work , and which suit the market economy .

The party committee of this brigade learned from its investigations that alongside the deepening and development of reform and opening up , some cadres and soldiers were lacking in a necessary mental preparation for the impacts that had been exerted on their personal interests by certain reform polices of the state and the army ; and when faced with practical problems , such as the layoff of their family members and an increasingly difficult situation in the resettlement of demobilized armymen , these cadres and soldiers would usually feel puzzled and would develop doubts and misgivings .  
Luo Dahua , professor of psychology of China Politics and Law University , said : In foreign countries , the main purpose of their psychologists ' visits to prisons is to cure criminals with fairly evident psychological disease , but in China , our psychological treatment for criminals is aimed at transforming them in line with the criminals ' personal characteristics and raising the psychological quality of the entire group of prisoners .  
Analyzing the distribution of increased loans , we can see that those loans have not only satisfied the need of state key construction projects , infrastructure construction and the reasonable funds requirement of large and medium sized enterprises , but also supported the development of medium and small enterprises and non-public sectors of the economy as well as the personal consumption needs .  Those loans have played an important role in expanding domestic consumption and promoting economic development .  
Cult leaders accumulated wealth unlawfully and in a big way , and organised their followers to besiege media units , schools , scientific research institutes critical of the sect , seriously disturbing the public order , infringing upon human rights , and endangering other people 's personal safety .  
However , a handful of leading cadres have actually failed to withstand the tests and therefore swerved their ideals and belief , lost their revolutionary integrity , abused power for personal gain , accepted bribes in violation of laws , and become corrupt and degenerate .  
The General Staff , Political , and Logistics Departments and major military units held party committee and standing committee meetings on numerous occasions to study and grasp the important thinking .  The principal leaders of these departments and units were personally involved in the mobilization efforts and took the lead in discussing their personal experience and in attending lectures .  
Leading cadres should take the lead in studying the " Three Represents " , should publicize and disseminate the " Three Represents " through their personal fruitful experiences , and should go deep down to the grassroots units , instructing them face to face , explaining the difficult points and unclear points , inspiring and guiding them , and assisting the Party members and broad numbers of officers and soldiers in grassroots units in their effectively studying and satisfactorily carrying out the important thinking of the " Three Represents " .  
They do not manage nor bother to know those issues affecting the personal interests and feelings of the masses and do not conduct patient and meticulous ideological and political work for giving timely guidance .  Some grass-roots party organizations are in a weak and slack state and do not display the roles they should in the ideological and political work .  
Only by paying close attention to building a contingent of qualified personal as a fundamental task will it be possible for us to implement the grand strategy of strengthening our armed forces through science and technology .  
The people are now seeking the enhancement of their life quality after they achieved quantitative satisfaction .  The broad masses have truly feel the great superiority of socialism from their personal experience in the great enhancement of their own living standards , and support socialism from the bottom of their hearts .  Socialism has won an extensive and profound mass foundation in China .  
Dependents of military cadres are a special occupational group .  Realizing the objective of " people having jobs and jobs being profitable " depends first on favorable policies and second on personal quality .  The latter is more important .  
For military cadres ' families who can not find employment for reasons other than personal one , labor and social security departments can allow them to pay , on a voluntary basis , basic pension insurance fees in accordance with a ratio based on local average wage .  Their pension insurance records can be kept at local employment service organizations .  In addition , they can enjoy exemption or reduction of various management fees .  
Comrade Geng Biao upheld the policy of practicing economy while conducting diplomatic activities .  He was strict with himself and never gave any thought about personal fame and wealth .  He sought no privilege for himself and always maintained the distinctive political character of plain living and hard struggle .  
It is obviously improper to allow the adoption of a punishment measure resulting in depriving people of personal freedom in such a simple and easy way.Because there is no strict and fair procedures for sending a person to labor reeducation , citizens may be unfairly treated .  At the same time , as there is no strictly defined standards for labor reeducation , some people who should not have been sent to receive labor reeducation were also punished in this way .  
Thanks to the extensive application of such high-tech research achievements as satellite positioning systems , expert diagnostic systems , and distance support maintenance systems , the space of vast battlefields has been condensed in a tiny screen , in which equipment commanders assumed personal command in a " central command tent " and had the situation of the entire battlefields well in hand without going out , and they were moving units on the Web .  
All in all , to continuously accelerate reform and construction in the military and fulfill the sacred mission , the military must vigorously promote the spirit of emancipating their thinking and seeking truth from facts , the spirit of closely following the development of the era and innovating courageously , the spirit of unswervingly marching forward despite difficulties , the spirit of struggling with painstaking efforts and pursuing effectiveness , and the spirit of disregarding personal fame and interests , being unselfish and dedicating oneself .  
However , the minority work in a bureaucratic and formalistic manner .  They work in a perfunctory , over-ambitious and unrealistic manner .  They are keen on pursuing personal fame and their own interests and forcing others with grandiose items .  
They say the current society and laws must first be destroyed before they can preach their teachings .  On several occasions , Li Hongzhi issued " personal instructions " to practitioners , ordered them to lay siege to government organs and newspaper offices , engaged in illegal gathering and anti-government activities , and served as a pawn for foreign anti-China forces in a vain attempt to play a role that the western anti-China forces have failed to do .  
It is a fact that comrades of every line gave priority to overall situation interests , disregarded personal gains and losses , and worked in a diligent , united and cooperative manner .  That enabled us to create miracles in our scientific and technological projects within a relatively short period of time and with relatively small investments .  
Vigorously disseminating and promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is very important for us to live through the rigid test of reform , opening up and developing the socialist market economy and continuously advancing the current great project .  
Through the long-term revolution and construction , our Party and military have been adhering to their lofty ambitions despite miseries .  They have upheld their great righteousness despite dangers and difficulties and have continuously maintained their mighty strength to unite and fight .  An important part of this is that countless Party members and revolutionary military professionals have been indifferent to personal interests and fame as if they were tasteless boiled water while regarding their careers as being as weighty as a mountain .  
The spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is incompatible with those corrupt ideas by nature .  Vigorously promoting this spirit can effectively sweep away such corruption and enable us to maintain a strong will to fight , to maintain lofty ideas , firm stances and the correct direction so as to formulate spiritual strengths , values and public opinions beneficial to the reform and construction .  
In light of this principle , vigorously promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is not harmful to the socialist economic situation and the development of the socialist market economy - - it is beneficial to the development of the socialist market economy and the consolidation of the socialist economic base .  
They should spend more time on studying than entertaining for social purposes , and should pay more attention to making contributions than considering their personal gains .  Each of them should strive to be a person who is pure , lofty , moral , free from vulgar interests and beneficial to the people .  
The new situation and arduous tasks require that we must regard vigorously disseminating and promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career as an important task of the current ideological and political construction , and devote efforts to carrying out this task in a persistent and effective manner .  
We must persist in the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences and being understanding and tolerant , we can not regard personal problems as organizational issues , we can not treat cognitive issues as political issues , and we should not create a tense atmosphere only because certain isolated cases of erroneous ideological and political views arise .  
The majority of retired military cadres should maintain and carry forward the excellent traditions of our military , conscientiously be considerate of difficulties faced by governments at all levels , align personal interests with overall ones , embrace and support reform in ones behavior and make new contributions to strengthening the country and revitalizing the Chinese nation .  
To continuously advance military construction and reform , fulfill the sacred mission placed on the shoulders of our military , we must carry forward the spirit of emancipating thinking and seeking truth from facts , the spirit of keeping up with the times and courageously innovating , the spirit of marching forward despite difficulties and advancing with an indomitable will , the spirit of struggling with painstaking efforts and pursuing effectiveness and the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career .  
To be more specific , the interaction between these diverse values and theories - - liberalists ' pursuit of democracy , personal freedom and enlightenment ; neo-conservatives ' affirmation of the need for political order and stability in the course of modernization and development ; and the New Left 's concern for the interests of the disadvantaged at the grassroots - - plays a positive practical role in safeguarding the sound and rational development of a society and in bringing about a more balanced society through checks and balances .  
However , a small number of rural grass-roots cadres have a poor understanding of their mission to wholeheartedly serve the people .  The work style of these cadres is not down-to-earth , their work approach is simple and rude , they do not feel settled in working at the grassroots , and some of them even seek personal profits abusing their powers and encroach on the masses ' interests .  These problems urgently need to be solved .  
In some places , there are activities of using smuggling and producing fake products as a way to become rich and the dangerous situation of linking crimes of smuggling and manufacturing fake products with local and personal interests .  Some people even protect those who have been engaged in smuggling or producing fake products and create artificial obstacles to " cracking down on smuggling and manufacturing fake products " at the cost of state and overall interests .  
Deputy Chief of General Staff Wu Quanxu , who instructed the drill , claimed that to protect the people 's personal and property safety and to minimize the loss from the possible nuclear accidents , the PLA has established and perfected the rescue and commanding system , whereby the servicemen are combined with the people , the peacetime need is combined with the wartime need , and the three armed services are integrated , and has already possessed the capabilities of providing rapid rescue to all sorts of nuclear accidents .  
Under new circumstances , the political struggles and tests facing officers and men are mainly tasks in daily life , and they rarely experience major personal struggles .  Consequently , some comrades may easily become less politically aware , fail to notice disturbances in their peaceful life , and not be politically vigilant against infiltration of hostile forces .  
Those who deviate from the party 's basic line and behave in a double-dealing manner , those who fail to stand tests at critical moments of the political struggle or hold an ambiguous attitude in an attempt to dodge the struggle , those who disregard the interests of the party and the people and are only keen on seeking personal fame and power through getting official positions by means of bribery or currying favor with influential people or playing defrauds must not be allowed to enter leading bodies .  
We should correct the guiding principle of our tasks , make great efforts to eradicate unhealthy workings styles like bureaucracy , characterized by staying high above reality and soldiers , and formalism , characterized by pursuing unrealistic personal fame and working in a perfunctory manner , so as to improve the comprehensive quality of officers .  
They should also emulate Wang Wei 's lofty ideological character of making selfless dedication , loving and respecting his work , disregarding personal gains and loses , and being indifferent to fame and profit so that they will be able to take the initiative to subordinate themselves to and serve the cardinal needs of reform and construction , cultivate a fine moral character , establish a lofty goal of life , and maintain the unchangeable integrity of revolutionary military personnel .  
It urged them to learn from Wang Wei 's lofty thinking and character of selflessly dedicating himself , devoting himself to his assignment , not being concerned for personal gains and losses , and not being moved by fame and money ; and to self-consciously subject themselves to and serve the general interests of reform and construction , nurture good morality and sentiment , establish lofty goals , and maintain the steadfastness , faithfulness , and moral integrity of a revolutionary soldier .  
His violations of law and disciple are serious and disgusting and have given the public a very bad impression .  This is a typical case of a leading cadre of a law-enforcement department bending the law to serve personal interests and abusing official power for selfish ends .  A severe punishment is absolutely necessary .  
The revised Marriage Law , with the Constitution as the basis , has intensified the legal readjustment to marriage relations and added some provisions regarding the specific issues on personal and property relations in marriage and family spheres .  Meanwhile , it is compatible with China 's national situation , has reflected the aspirations of the broad masses of the people , and is a vital achievement in building our marriage and family laws and systems .  
Among the prohibitive clauses , the revised law has added the stipulations of prohibiting the married people from cohabiting with the persons other than their spouses and prohibiting domestic violence .  This has enhanced , in legislation , the dynamics of safeguarding monogamy and protecting the personal rights of family members .  This has also provided a basis in basic law for stemming unlawful behaviors of this kind through other legal means .

Local governments and masses have taken great pains to persuade and educate them ; and have tried hard to awaken their conscience with love , warm their hearts with deep concern , convert their stubborn beliefs with tolerance , and dispel their superstitious ideas with scientific knowledge .  In the end , they have finally recognized the true colors and the harms of the evil cult , made a clean break from Li Hongzhi , and exposed and condemned the various crimes committed by the " Falungong " with their own personal experiences .  
The basis for the economic expert 's judgment is that the principal administrator is formulating policies on " political correctness . "  As a result , professional bureaucrats have lost their functions , the capable people have remained silent , and those who curry favor with the authorities for personal gain have followed the direction where the wind blows , thus resulting in corrupt political practice .  
They should stick to a lofty moral standard and the revolutionary spirit , keep the masses firmly in mind , struggle with painstaking efforts , align their personal interests with public interests , be concerned about and protect the interests of officers and soldiers and make great efforts to realize the Party 's aim of serving the people wholeheartedly .  
Fei Xiaotong , honorary chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Democratic League and a famous socialist , made a speech at the meeting .

Failure to repay money borrowed from colleague and relatives is ruinous to personal relationships , and people have gone to ground to avoid their debts . Those with more savvy have managed to shift their own losses onto their firm , while others have been lucky in that their firm has accepted responsibility for their own debt - - securities firms are keen to maintain an immaculate record to qualify under the Ministry of Finance 's recent arrangements for the financial investment and securities industry .  
New Environment Foundation founder Prof . Ch'ai Sung-lin , who has written on Taiwan folk beliefs , maintains the popularity of divination reflects modern man 's inner uncertainty and helplessness in the face of rapid social changes and confused values . Apparent social injustices , such as businessmen profiting by exploiting legal loopholes , or lackluster politicians getting to the top , have led people to conclude that success depends more on good luck than personal effort . This explains why so many people resort to casting fortunes and interpreting horoscopes .  
In traditional China there was a strong emphasis on the here and now , and among the upper classes ancestor worship tended to be functional rather than religious in nature . The same naturally held true among the lower classes , where for ordinary people with little familiarity with classical writings ancestor worship was seen in terms of personal gain .  
I would like to express my personal appreciation of the two books I requested when subscribing to the magazine , In search of Photo Past ( , ) which offer the western reader beautiful , realistic and moving pictures of Taiwan life , the quality of which has seldom been equaled in photographic publications .  
Hung Chia-li , a matchmaker at the I Hsuan Agency , says that some women deliberately " downgrade " themselves on their personal information cards , changing a master 's degree to a bachelor 's degree or a bureau chief position to a section head , because they 're afraid of scaring men off . Statistics show that more than half of all women with a college education or higher have married husbands less well educated than they are .  
The faculty report issued under Day thus stated that the purpose of the university " is not to teach that which is peculiar to any one of our professions , but to lay the foundation which is common to them all . . . . The advantages furnished by residence in college can do little more than stimulate and aid the personal efforts " of the individual student . The report remained influential through the Civil War , and moderated the speed of the introduction of a utilitarian curriculum into US universities .  
Since we have come to understand more about the Japanese , We have discovered that generally they are embarrassed about beliefs that might sound unscientific . On the other hand , they are quite open and brash about things that Americans consider to be private , such as personal finance and sexual experience - - especially the men .  
" Star " level personalities with attractive faces and sleek bodies would cooperate with a professional photographer to produce a series of carefully calculated shots . These would be published as " personal albums " wrapped in clear plastic ( they could only be thumbed through after purchase ) , and provided as products for the enjoyment of movie stars ' and singers ' fans .  
Since the 1960s women in Taiwan have been entering the labor market in droves , making a major contribution to the island 's economic miracle . There are equal educational opportunities , greater opportunities in the work place , and an ever more diverse society . . . . These have allowed Taiwanese women to break through the historical Chinese mold for women as weak , dependent and subservient , revealing active , independent and self-motivated women striving for personal achievement .  
Environmental environment needs upgrading : Environmentally friendly products are the wave of the future . For example , Acer , which already has a sound foundation in Germany and Holland , in order to meet European environmental regulations , began a year and a half ago to offer a personal computer which " does n't use a single screw , " but is fit together out of molded parts .  
And they ca n't refuse these evenings out but must attend to them like their regular duties in the office . " At the same time as paying close attention to the course of the conversation between the two main parties , they also force themselves to try to be witty and interesting , so as to make the scene more festive , " says Li Tao , director of external affairs at Ford Lio Ho Motors , speaking from personal experience .  
Entertaining at home will become more and more common in Taiwan in the future , " says Li Tao , the director of external affairs at Ford Lio Ho Motors , who will occasionally whip up a few steaks for special guests . The is play of personal care , the warm atmosphere and the savings all make entertaining at home a good choice .  
Passports are intended to serve as personal documents to use abroad for identification and proof of nationality . But because of unusual circumstances in the nation 's foreign relations , the history of the ROC passport over the last 40 years sets it apart . Now the document , worth tens of thousands of US dollars , is coveted by international thieves .  
Never mind the boss wife 's beautiful , fresh outward appearance that makes her seem so intelligent and capable . Actually , her self image and sense of personal worth may very well be stunted by the view she has long fostered that she must always look after others and not care for herself , " Wu Cheng-tien explains . When it comes to having the boss wife give over all her professional obligations to someone else , there usually is an ineffable feeling of loss .  
If it is true that in popular fashion " there is no such thing as absolute rebellion or subversion " and that anti-social and counter-cultural behavior will ultimately be co-opted by the mainstream , then flashy protest can only bring fleeting personal pleasure and has no real function in terms of bringing about social change . Moreover , gender performance can only be done for performance 's sake .  
He believed that a nation 's musical roots are to be found in its folk songs , and so he went among the people to collect this music , which reflects the life of the great majority - - the lowest level in Huang You-li 's pyramid . After sorting the wheat from the chaff , Bartok incorporated the folk songs into his own works , thus not only creating a unique personal style , but also preserving folk music and raising it to a higher artistic level .  
Ho Te-lai , born ten years after Liu , resisted the formulaic paintings of the competitions and for the greater part of his life shut himself up in Japan , where he joined the Shinkozo-Sha ( the " New Structure Society " ) school characterized by freedom and unrestricted direction . He remained faithful to his own thoughts , and to his personal creative device of inserting words into his paintings .  
With regard to this , some scholars early on suggested that medical histories , being a precious medical resource and crucial to human life , should be transferred along with the person , and should not be locked within the hospital . Ideal as this suggestion may sound , medical centers maintain the hesitant mentality of " if personal medical history is really opened up , wo n't there be endless medical controversies ? "  
In the past , depictions of nature often stopped short at the level of hypochondriac moaning . Today we should write slowly and deliberately about our personal , genuine environment , about the full range of phenomena , and we should employ all the different forms of literature . Good works , even works of complete philosophical reflection , will then arise .  
Nevertheless , according to Chang Le-chi 's description , NGOs always want to keep their image of " being afraid of becoming politically sullied . " They stand somewhat aloof from authorities . They even purposefully maintain a safe distance from political figures with similar ideas , and they forbid currently unployed essential staff from running for public office , to prevent opportunists from turning social activism into a springboard for amassing personal political resources . "  
The cat 's owner wanted to invoke the " vicious dog law " to have Lucy destroyed , but Lucy 's owner held that the law was intended to punish dogs whose bad deeds had hurt humans , and was not applicable to conflicts between animals . Fur Ball 's owner , however , claimed personal suffering as the result of Fur Ball 's cruel death , and thus argued that Lucy had caused injury to a person , making the vicious dog law applicable to this case .  
Peng Yung-kuan says that the people who are really in pressing need of daycare are disabled and infirm old people who need personal care , and not the people that daycare services are currently geared towards : mobile , healthy senior citizens who are capable of taking care of themselves .  
The most striking of these featured Chinese figures and buildings in bright colors and gold , excessively stretched and distorted according to the shape of the object . They revealed the designer 's powerfully individual style and imaginative personal vision of the paradise of China .  
" In the past , society was very closed , and it was hard to get information , so people really respected their professors , " says Lin Chin-chuan . Now we live amidst an information explosion , with rapid development of all forms of media . Teachers are no longer the only source of knowledge . Naturally the paternalistic , god-like authority they enjoyed in the past has declined , and it has become necessary for them relate to students on a more personal level .  
Interestingly , the staff that had been brought up on Lisa Kuan 's strict demands at first found it a bit difficult to adjust to Wang , who is relaxed , has a lively sense of humor , and is warm and genteel in her personal relations . Sunny Hsiao said it well with a metaphor from ROC history : " It was like going from the period of tutelary authoritarianism to that of constitutional democracy . "  
Traditional Chinese placed great emphasis on proper rituals or patterns of behavior , and failure to observe these was deemed to be criminal . For example , these days a lack of filial piety is considered to be a personal moral problem , in which outsiders should not get too involved . But in the past it was a serious offense . Not only could the individual be punished through the state legal system , family law was even more rigorous and inescapable , and violators were expelled from the clan .  
Kris Chen of the Taipei Computer Association , who is in charge of the Industrial Technology Research and Development Office for the VR Industrial Alliance , argues that these conditions present Taiwan with an excellent opportunity . He notes that Taiwan already has a deep foundation in personal computers and integrated circuits . Thus , if VR core technology and peripheral equipment can be developed in time , not only will this spur industrial upgrading in Taiwan , it can reduce current high production costs through mass production .  
The aim of educational reform is to put into practice a concept of education that imparts happiness , contentment , pluralism and mutual respect . Such education is designed to develop potentialities , respect individualism , promote humanism , and encourage creativity . All unreasonable restrictions will be removed to allow the emergence of a system of life-long learning . Ample room will be reserved for individual originality and personal traits to ensure the continued pursuit of self-growth and self-realization .  
But in the view of the institute 's director Chen San-ching , since Liu Shao-tang began the magazine thirty-odd years ago , although his work can not be said to follow the traditional methods of academic research , his contribution to Chinese contemporary history has been incomparable , for he has rescued countless quantities of first-hand material including manuscripts , photographs , documents and personal memoirs , and has inspired many people who then participated actively in research and writing .  
I feel like a late 20th century George Catlin , who traveled the American West painting portraits of native Americans . Armed with a camera rather than a paintbrush , I have the chance to capture Yunnan 's minorities in all their happy glory , while they still feel content within their ancient cultural perimeters . What began as a documentary exercise evolved into something more personal .  
But it was not only deep in the mountains that one could see the spirit of thatched-cottage living among ancient literati . Even in the busy urban centers , some high officials , tired of extravagance and luxury , embellished their personal gardens with rustic thatched structures .  
In the last few decades , the structure of the joint entrance examination has been generally very fair . Just like the civil service examination system of ancient times , it is not based upon one 's personal background ; everyone is given an equal opportunity . This has had a certain benefit for mobility between social classes .  
Other topics include " loving a younger man " - is it shameful for a female student to become involved with a boy who is her academic junior ? - and , how to define " best friends of the opposite sex ? " The true stories that emerge through these discussions touch on the personal concerns of the participants .  
Whether concerned about knowing love at least once , or about attaining everlasting love , the true meaning of " free love " is listening to your own genuine needs and making responsible choices . The same is also true of Sun Chung-hsing 's personal mission in the " cause " of love .  
Lin feels that this is the unfair result of women 's Catch-22 position in society . At any rate , Lin believes that buddying around with the police , having a broad set of personal connections , and being familiar with a lot of bizarre criminal tactics are n't really directly relevant to whether or not a person can direct a case .  
From the literature , he categorized six types of intelligence which are attributable to neurobiology : linguistic , musical , logical / mathematical , spatial , bodily kinesthetic and personal .  
As an example of the diversity of intellectual abilities , Chung recalls the famous Harvard psychologist Howard Gardner who did research on intelligence in 1983 , differentiating seven different categories of intellectual abilities-linguistic , logical / mathematical , spatial , bodily kinesthetic , personal and introspective .  
Second , Lu Hsiu-lien offered strong personal credentials : a strong academic record , a clean and fresh image , a background as a leader in the women 's movement , and her imprisonment as an early democratic activist back in the early 1980s . She also showed a far-reaching boldness for running the county for " four years and nine months " ( i.e . the nine-month replacement term plus an expected victory in the regular year-end contest ) .  
" It is really wonderful that such a rich , perfect thing can appear before all our eyes through the meticulous process of organizing , recording and production . And this clarity is not just a clarity of theory , but also an emotional clarity , between just this person and just this piece of music , here and now . Even in the present age , when tradition is in decline , a concerned person wo n't be lonely at all , but will rejoice at his or her own personal good fortune . "  
Taiwan 's conception of personal finance has changed a lot . Chang Shui-chiang , editor-in-chief of the Commercial Times , said when he was a guest on the program that during the " golden age " of the last decade , the middle class has risen , government restrictions have been relaxed , and there have been ample business opportunities . A conception of personal finance has become one of the foundations of economic life .  
Most may remember how , wherever Chiang went , he was always accompanied by burly individuals in casual dress or suits , with short , neatly groomed hair and stern expressions . These were the men everyone referred to simply as the " Chihais , " and their main mission was to assure the personal safety of the head of state 24 hours a day .  
One way , reveals a veterinarian , is that many people whose pets become seriously ill just abandon them at the animal hospital , never returning to pick them up . There is no system in place in Taiwan to take in stray animals . Given operational constraints on a hospital , the only thing a vet can do is to set these unhealthy animals free in the wild . But this turns the problem from being an implicitly contractual one ( between owner and vet ) , or personal moral one , into one foisted on society .  
Sandee Chen , who has been performing for three years , mainly has used her personal life as the subject of her songs before . Her latest album which came out last year , " Before a Bad Person Becomes Bad , " had an urban folk style and clearly expressed her views on society-satirizing the paparazzi , commemorating Peng Wan-ju , complaining about the refuse collection regulations and reflecting on the Chen Chin-hsing incident .  
Huang Hsiao-tsui , who works in the guide office , remembers that the year before last guides asked those who were going on the Chingtienkang Nature Walk to wear straw shoes and use a shoulder pole to carry their personal articles . They then set out along the old " Fish Road , " gaining an understanding of what the people of earlier generations had to go through . After walking the route , an old woman in her eighties said that she had never been so happy in her life , which greatly moved the activity organizers .  
" He has melded cultural affirmation and ethnic self-respect with literary practice to create a purely Chinese literary form , " says Ng Kim Chew . " This provides solace to his personal sensibilities , both literary and ethnic . " There are few who can compare to ECM writers living in Taiwan in terms of how hard they work , either . Li Yung-ping was once an assistant professor in the department of foreign languages and literatures at National Sun Yat-sen University .  
Liu Tseng-kui , a research associate at the Academia Sinica 's Institute of History and Philology , created History Links ' basic structure out of his personal collection of website bookmarks , accumulated over years of combing overseas websites for historical data for his research . In the course of his research , Liu discovered that while there was no dearth of literary and historical websites in Taiwan , there were few online collections of links to such sites . He therefore assembled his own site last year , dividing his vast collection of bookmarks into categories .  
Professor Rolf Trauzettel of the University of Bonn also observes that the ideas of Confucianists of different historical periods were not entirely the same , and that these ideas were often encumbered with political aims and made into instruments of rule by those in power . Early Confucianist thinking was basically constructed on the level of morality and personal integrity , so it is unlikely to have had either a positive or a negative influence on China 's modernization and economic development .  
During Premier Siew 's visit to Belize however , many overseas Chinese reported threats to their personal safety and property , or discrimination when passing through immigration . Premier Siew reported this to Prime Minister Musa , and instructed the ROC embassy to take care of local overseas Chinese . At the same time he emphasized that all embassies and consulates should give equal treatment to Chinese from the mainland in those countries with diplomatic ties to the ROC .  
Besides showing earning potential , responsibility , and trust , they say , the ideal male would also be emotionally honest , interested in life , understanding of others , open to continued personal growth , and always considerate of the woman 's feelings .  
Li argues : " Because traditional fathers were busy working , they were often absent from family life . Taiwan men have grown up without positive male role models . As a result , unless they have simply fit themselves into the traditional mold , they experience personal confusion , and can not find their own personalities . " In the long run , the inner life of men in this situation becomes stagnant , and they close themselves off .  
Lee has been steeped all his life in traditional Chinese morality , and has always sought to inject his personal ideas into his movies , " teaching a moral lesson in a fun way , " as the old Chinese saying goes . Many commentators have criticized Lee for being preachy , doctrinaire , and relying too much on stage techniques in his movies . Some even accuse him of sensationalism . Lee answers with a disarming , " That 's me , alright !  
While other painters created in their personal studios , she was usually at one hospital or another personally looking after her eldest son who was often on the edge of death . Wang would use her free moments to paint on hospital rags , towels , or cloth that she brought with her . Her paintings were nevertheless serene and joyful , like a rainbow reflecting off a cloud , and filled the room with the freshness of a spring breeze . You could say that she is Taiwan 's most legendary brush and ink artist .  
There 's a final point worth reflecting on : This is only the second direct election for the president in the history of the ROC . Yet the personal characters of the candidates and those around them have already become the main focus of public attention . There 's little discussion of public policy . For example , there 's been virtually no response to the white papers on China policy and constitutional reform issued by Chen Shui-bian .  
According to Zhang Weining , producer for the popular mainland singer Tian Zhen , " A-Mei 's performance style is suited to the outgoing , unrestrained character of the northern Chinese . " He feels that A-Mei is one of the few performers in pop music with a distinctive personal style .  
As such , he proposes that both Taiwan and the mainland issue a yearly white paper on human rights to review fishing disputes , cross-strait marriage and residency , and other human rights issues generated by contact between people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait . The ultimate objective in so doing would be to build up mutual trust by encouraging real interaction at the personal level .  
With such a vigorous network of local volunteers already in place , TCAC was prepared to act quickly when the earthquake hit central Taiwan last September . After zeroing in on Shihkang as the beneficiary of its assistance , TCAC wasted no time in sending relief supplies , establishing a newsletter , and building prefab shelters . In working together on the recovery effort , the people of Peipu and Shihkang have built up close personal ties .  
This system lasted for centuries , until , in the late Qing dynasty , reformers finally abandoned the imperial exam system . But the Four Books remained for many Chinese families a handbook for personal and family life . In Taiwan , even in the Japanese occupation era , education based on the Four Books was never wholly interrupted . And today , in basic textbooks on Chinese culture for middle-school students , not only is a great deal of the material drawn from the Four Books , but the interpretation basically follows that of Zhu Xi .  
Long-term efforts by women 's groups , plus the personal crusades of Yeh and New Party legislator Hsieh Chi-ta , ultimately built momentum in the Legislative Yuan . Finally , after exhaustive lobbying of the Executive Yuan , the Legislative Yuan passed the revision of certain provisions of the family dependents ' section of the civil law in 1996 , providing safeguards for Taiwanese women 's prenuptial property rights and child custody rights . This proved to be the first major step for equal rights between the sexes under law .  
In the future , when everything is connected , information technology will be an inescapable part of daily life . Your personal information will be included in various government or private databanks , to be monitored and processed by those who control these databanks . At the same time , each individual can build a little private Internet of their own , and put everything about themselves in for ease of management .  
When these become common , you will be able to go online through television , wireless application protocol ( WAP ) - standard phones , personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) , and even digital watches . Moreover , you 'll be able to stay connected 24 hours a day . It will be just like TV today-flip it on and you are ready to go .  
His disciples have written over a dozen works of their " personal testaments , " all telling of miracles : being brought back from the brink of death or saved from some calamity . Now that Lee 's organization is gaining more adherents in the Taipei metropolitan area , he has become a somewhat legendary figure . Below is an edited version of our interview with him .  
I wanted to stand up and testify in my personal status-as a writer who was imprisoned , shackled , and beaten because I insisted on freedom of speech and refused to bow down before authoritarianism ; and as a " thought criminal " for whom a military court sought the death penalty-to the fact that the dark ages are over in Taiwan , and that mothers will no longer have to cry for political reasons .  
The growing number of leadership training activities sponsored by Taiwan NGOs mix personal development with professional skills enhancement , religious training , volunteerism and political reform . These programs can help charismatic leaders who are both politically involved and morally upstanding to become greater forces for good . Amid growing cultural diversity , only a new kind of leader with broader , more holistic values will be able to create frameworks suitable to the new era .  
With simple common sense , a basic level of awareness and proper personal hygiene , the public has very little to fear from infectious diseases .  
Like most young people , Robert Huang did n't figure he 'd be making it monstrously big in business , but opportunity came knocking when a group of friends from the Tunghai University department of architecture decided to found an architecture firm and build a residential division where people would be able to establish the close personal ties typical of traditional rural communities while still enjoying all the conveniences of modern apartment life .  
A lot of people in my business have also attended these spiritual growth classes , hoping to break through their personal difficulties , have more harmonious personal relationships , and progress to a higher level at work , " says Chen Tsu-yin . Chen recently entered the insurance business , and this year , despite her great terror about meeting people , won the annual best individual achievement prize given by her company 's customer service department .  
To modern people , divorced from sacred experience and cut off from traditional rituals , Liuh suggests that you can reconstruct your own personal altar , a corner where you can find peace and quiet , undisturbed , where you can listen to your own spirit and connect with the universe , a place where you belong and can always return on your journey through life .  
Courageously facing marriage As a sociologist well aware of the rising divorce rate and the unwillingness of young people to even get hitched because they have seen too many unhappy couples , Hsueh gives some practical advice . While people should make as serious a commitment to marriage as they do to a career , as in a career one can change course or start again . When a marriage really can not be xxxxsustained , divorce should be a socially acceptable alternative , and does not symbolize personal failure or moral bankruptcy .  
Liao Ching-pi , an associate professor of social work at Soochow University and director of the Yoyuen Social Work Foundation , holds strongly to the newer view . Studies done overseas , says Liao , " show that affairs are most likely to happen with men who are unsuccessful in their careers , suffering from sexual dysfunction , or faced with problems in their family or personal relationships that they ca n't handle . "  
Liu was originally trained as an electrical engineer , and in fact served as such for the greater part of his life . He took up the brush during middle age and went on to develop a highly personal style . Later in life , Liu crossed the border into the field of anthropology , making bold expeditions to Africa , Borneo , Latin America , and Oceania . He bounced back and forth between myriad pursuits , and was able to achieve impressive results in each field .  
And an LNG procurement worth several hundred billion New Taiwan dollars is an affair which can be carried out only through a public bidding process in conformance with the WTO spirit of free competition , not one which can be decided by anyone 's personal say-so . Such issues must , as ever , be handled in accordance with legal procedure together with consideration of the national interest .  
In the past , except for special industry databases , sources such as online news sites and all kinds of personal web pages provided an endless wealth of freely accessible information for people browsing the web , leaving little room for the survival of commercial web sites . Even portal sites such as Yam , and Yahoo 's Taiwan subsidiary Kimo , which claimed to have millions of subscribers , were frustrated by their lack of an " excuse " to charge fees .  
And can one who is so in tune with the beat of the universe be equally engaged on a personal level with those about her ? When talk turns to love and friendship , Flor de Loto is unreserved as usual . Popular as a child , she was the object of no little admiration after going to Spain . But her full social life simply enabled her to pour all the more energy into her dancing , without feeling as though she were missing out in other areas of life .  
The draft bill included specific provisions defining political contributions as the outright gift of personal property or real estate , or the provision of other economic benefits , to a person or group participating in an election campaign or otherwise engaged in political activities .  
In Nigeria , Kay actively strove to understand the nation 's medical and healthcare situation . Moreover , he went out on a limb , as a foreigner amid the authoritarian political atmosphere of Nigeria at the time , to write a paper expressing his personal opinions about medicine and education . The paper caused a lot of discussion , with impassioned arguments for and against that really stirred up the local government . He started out excited but ended up alarmed , not knowing if he was bringing good fortune or disaster upon himself .  
The Cultural Bureau of Taichung County last year organized the teachers ' pilgrimage group so as to disseminate understanding of the religious meaning of the pilgrimage and its transforming spiritual power . This year it added groups of volunteers who explained the cultural and historical significance of the festival and recounted their personal experiences with the majesty and power of the tradition .  
From my personal perspective as someone involved in many different fields , and also from the East Asian perspective , this is a good thing . Classical Western art is very structured , and over the centuries has built up a formidable degree of internal consistency . But it is this very internal consistency that turns Western art into a closed system . When art evolves to a certain point , it becomes what is known in Buddhism as " worldly wisdom , " which means to regard " the seeming " as real .  
Public health workers , originally at the frontline of community epidemic prevention , ended up performing menial tasks like delivering lunches and emptying garbage cans . For many people , this was an incredible turn of events . A glance at the history of Taiwan 's public health system showed these workers , deployed at the grassroots level , had a vast reservoir of personal experience and had constituted the primary force in fighting epidemics .  
Who can avoid the reach of multi-media consortiums , with their tremendous financial resources and influence ? They can take in politicians who are down on their luck ; and even those who want to get public exposure to express their own ideas end up surrendering to the media . The result is that no one-neither the idealistic politician nor the deep thinker-ends up staying true to personal principles .  
But it 's a model suitable only to authors willing to demean themselves . As a whole , mainland writers are either concerned with popular urban lit or more focused on their own high personal expectations about their work . Few are candidates to write popular motivational books , let alone take long tours around the country to publicize these books .  
Because of my personal interest in collecting , I 've spent over 20 years doing field research . I 've come in contact with a lot of extremely valuable first-hand materials and seen many aspects of our past that do n't get mentioned in formal historiography . As a result , I 've come to feel strongly that history does n't really come alive unless you approach it from a lot of different angles and look at historical development as something pushed forward by an entire people .  
Asked what areas of personal concern they feel they most need to address , respondents answered , in order of priority : job skills or professional abilities and knowledge ( 30.1% ) ; personal economic or financial situation ( 21.5% ) ; foreign language ability ( 11.2% ) ; level of academic achievement ( 9.6% ) ; quality of life or place of residence ( 5.2% ) ; and religious or spiritual growth ( 2.6% ) .  
Looking at the question from the " support " side , elderly people have more financial and physical ability to look after themselves , so aged parents no longer need to rely on their children . Also , young people are now putting off marriage until much later , so they have much more time under their personal control . Finally , young people have their own marketable skills and incomes , so they do n't need to be under the thumb of their parents . For all these reasons , a carefree life seems a good choice .  
Looking at things from a broader perspective , in terms of societal rather than personal development , the same process seems to happen to the dreams of societies themselves . You could consider the developing nations of the world to be the global equivalent of elementary school students ; as they work toward modernization some make rapid progress , while others creep forward slowly . Both groups , though , keep working toward their goals of modernization , hoping to one day reach the same level of prosperity as their developed brethren .  
In his third year of senior high , in connection with the inauguration of the president of Costa Rica , Wu accepted an invitation to put on a personal exhibit in Central America , but he promised to go only after the school granted him leave . While he was preparing that same academic year for graduation and the equivalency exam , his father fell seriously ill and had to go into the hospital . While at the hospital caring for his father , Wu kept worrying about failing the equivalency exam .  
From finding a " mother structure " of artistic technique close to his own personal tendencies , to overcoming the staid or bewildered aspects of his art and nurturing a " child structure " opposite to his own basic character , Chou 's own perspective on life has changed , so that he has become smoother in the way he deals with people .  
" Exploration is a scientific endeavor , " he says . Aside from fostering personal courage , the ability to conquer fear , and other valuable characteristics , exploring can refine the skills needed for various outdoor activities and help foster discipline and self-improvement . " As a result , I can pass on the techniques I have learned to even more people . This is the main purpose of exploration , " Chen stresses .  
In mid-June , Taipei City Councilor Liu Yao-jen declared at a press conference that he had bought on the Internet personal information on 1,200 primary and middle school students at NT $ 1 a pop from a " name list seller . " All of this data , most of which was on students in the final years of primary school in Sungshan and Hsinyi districts , had been burned onto a CD-ROM , and included the names of the students and their family members , their grade , telephone number , and address .  
Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan has declared that individuals who have suffered losses because government employees leaked their personal information are entitled to seek compensation from the government . According to existing regulations , the maximum aggregate compensation for a single personal information leak case is only NT $ 20 million . The Ministry of Justice is currently rewriting the law to raise this amount to NT $ 50 million . Department stores and major retailers will also fall under the LPCMPI .  
Tang Yaw-chung , professor in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering , National Taiwan University , says that modern technology makes it very easy to copy sound and image data . The more personal data criminals are able to lay their hands on , the harder it is for ordinary people to differentiate between the genuine and the bogus , and the easier it is for them to be taken in .  
At my children 's school , too , there are many truly dedicated teachers who put a lot of effort into running more flexible classes and communicating with parents , making them a part of their children 's education . These teachers have a four-pronged goal for their students : emotional development , life skills , personal growth , and fundamental academic knowledge .

To accelerate the achievement of national modernization , to strengthen comprehensive national capability and international competitiveness , and to meet the opportunities and challenges presented by the new century , it is imperative to earnestly implement the CPC 's education policy , to vigorously develop education , to comprehensively advance personal quality education , and to promote the comprehensive development of children and youths , in an effort to train high quality workers and specialized personnel of various levels and fields meeting the requirements of modernization construction .  
To carry out personal quality education is to rectify such one-sided understandings and practices , so as to train " idealistic , moral , educated , and disciplined " socialist builders and successors who are comprehensively developed ethically , intellectually , physically , and aesthetically .  
Have personal quality education permeate all such stages as preschool education , elementary and secondary school education , vocational education , adult education , and higher education as well as all categories of education , and all such aspects as school education , family education , and social education , so that the different stages and aspects have different contents and emphases but are also closely linked to each other and in mutual cooperation , advancing as an integral whole .

The party committee of this brigade learned from its investigations that alongside the deepening and development of reform and opening up , some cadres and soldiers were lacking in a necessary mental preparation for the impacts that had been exerted on their personal interests by certain reform polices of the state and the army ; and when faced with practical problems , such as the layoff of their family members and an increasingly difficult situation in the resettlement of demobilized armymen , these cadres and soldiers would usually feel puzzled and would develop doubts and misgivings .  
Luo Dahua , professor of psychology of China Politics and Law University , said : In foreign countries , the main purpose of their psychologists ' visits to prisons is to cure criminals with fairly evident psychological disease , but in China , our psychological treatment for criminals is aimed at transforming them in line with the criminals ' personal characteristics and raising the psychological quality of the entire group of prisoners .  
Analyzing the distribution of increased loans , we can see that those loans have not only satisfied the need of state key construction projects , infrastructure construction and the reasonable funds requirement of large and medium sized enterprises , but also supported the development of medium and small enterprises and non-public sectors of the economy as well as the personal consumption needs .  Those loans have played an important role in expanding domestic consumption and promoting economic development .  
Cult leaders accumulated wealth unlawfully and in a big way , and organised their followers to besiege media units , schools , scientific research institutes critical of the sect , seriously disturbing the public order , infringing upon human rights , and endangering other people 's personal safety .  
However , a handful of leading cadres have actually failed to withstand the tests and therefore swerved their ideals and belief , lost their revolutionary integrity , abused power for personal gain , accepted bribes in violation of laws , and become corrupt and degenerate .  
The General Staff , Political , and Logistics Departments and major military units held party committee and standing committee meetings on numerous occasions to study and grasp the important thinking .  The principal leaders of these departments and units were personally involved in the mobilization efforts and took the lead in discussing their personal experience and in attending lectures .  
Leading cadres should take the lead in studying the " Three Represents " , should publicize and disseminate the " Three Represents " through their personal fruitful experiences , and should go deep down to the grassroots units , instructing them face to face , explaining the difficult points and unclear points , inspiring and guiding them , and assisting the Party members and broad numbers of officers and soldiers in grassroots units in their effectively studying and satisfactorily carrying out the important thinking of the " Three Represents " .  
They do not manage nor bother to know those issues affecting the personal interests and feelings of the masses and do not conduct patient and meticulous ideological and political work for giving timely guidance .  Some grass-roots party organizations are in a weak and slack state and do not display the roles they should in the ideological and political work .

Socialism has won an extensive and profound mass foundation in China .  
Dependents of military cadres are a special occupational group .  Realizing the objective of " people having jobs and jobs being profitable " depends first on favorable policies and second on personal quality .  The latter is more important .  
For military cadres ' families who can not find employment for reasons other than personal one , labor and social security departments can allow them to pay , on a voluntary basis , basic pension insurance fees in accordance with a ratio based on local average wage .  Their pension insurance records can be kept at local employment service organizations .  In addition , they can enjoy exemption or reduction of various management fees .  
Comrade Geng Biao upheld the policy of practicing economy while conducting diplomatic activities .  He was strict with himself and never gave any thought about personal fame and wealth .

It is obviously improper to allow the adoption of a punishment measure resulting in depriving people of personal freedom in such a simple and easy way.Because there is no strict and fair procedures for sending a person to labor reeducation , citizens may be unfairly treated .  At the same time , as there is no strictly defined standards for labor reeducation , some people who should not have been sent to receive labor reeducation were also punished in this way .

All in all , to continuously accelerate reform and construction in the military and fulfill the sacred mission , the military must vigorously promote the spirit of emancipating their thinking and seeking truth from facts , the spirit of closely following the development of the era and innovating courageously , the spirit of unswervingly marching forward despite difficulties , the spirit of struggling with painstaking efforts and pursuing effectiveness , and the spirit of disregarding personal fame and interests , being unselfish and dedicating oneself .  
However , the minority work in a bureaucratic and formalistic manner .  They work in a perfunctory , over-ambitious and unrealistic manner .  They are keen on pursuing personal fame and their own interests and forcing others with grandiose items .  
They say the current society and laws must first be destroyed before they can preach their teachings .  On several occasions , Li Hongzhi issued " personal instructions " to practitioners , ordered them to lay siege to government organs and newspaper offices , engaged in illegal gathering and anti-government activities , and served as a pawn for foreign anti-China forces in a vain attempt to play a role that the western anti-China forces have failed to do .  
It is a fact that comrades of every line gave priority to overall situation interests , disregarded personal gains and losses , and worked in a diligent , united and cooperative manner .  That enabled us to create miracles in our scientific and technological projects within a relatively short period of time and with relatively small investments .  
Vigorously disseminating and promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is very important for us to live through the rigid test of reform , opening up and developing the socialist market economy and continuously advancing the current great project .  
Through the long-term revolution and construction , our Party and military have been adhering to their lofty ambitions despite miseries .  They have upheld their great righteousness despite dangers and difficulties and have continuously maintained their mighty strength to unite and fight .  An important part of this is that countless Party members and revolutionary military professionals have been indifferent to personal interests and fame as if they were tasteless boiled water while regarding their careers as being as weighty as a mountain .  
The spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is incompatible with those corrupt ideas by nature .  Vigorously promoting this spirit can effectively sweep away such corruption and enable us to maintain a strong will to fight , to maintain lofty ideas , firm stances and the correct direction so as to formulate spiritual strengths , values and public opinions beneficial to the reform and construction .  
In light of this principle , vigorously promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career is not harmful to the socialist economic situation and the development of the socialist market economy - - it is beneficial to the development of the socialist market economy and the consolidation of the socialist economic base .  
They should spend more time on studying than entertaining for social purposes , and should pay more attention to making contributions than considering their personal gains .  Each of them should strive to be a person who is pure , lofty , moral , free from vulgar interests and beneficial to the people .  
The new situation and arduous tasks require that we must regard vigorously disseminating and promoting the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career as an important task of the current ideological and political construction , and devote efforts to carrying out this task in a persistent and effective manner .  
We must persist in the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences and being understanding and tolerant , we can not regard personal problems as organizational issues , we can not treat cognitive issues as political issues , and we should not create a tense atmosphere only because certain isolated cases of erroneous ideological and political views arise .  
The majority of retired military cadres should maintain and carry forward the excellent traditions of our military , conscientiously be considerate of difficulties faced by governments at all levels , align personal interests with overall ones , embrace and support reform in ones behavior and make new contributions to strengthening the country and revitalizing the Chinese nation .  
To continuously advance military construction and reform , fulfill the sacred mission placed on the shoulders of our military , we must carry forward the spirit of emancipating thinking and seeking truth from facts , the spirit of keeping up with the times and courageously innovating , the spirit of marching forward despite difficulties and advancing with an indomitable will , the spirit of struggling with painstaking efforts and pursuing effectiveness and the spirit of being indifferent to personal fame and interests and dedicating oneself to one 's career .  
To be more specific , the interaction between these diverse values and theories - - liberalists ' pursuit of democracy , personal freedom and enlightenment ; neo-conservatives ' affirmation of the need for political order and stability in the course of modernization and development ; and the New Left 's concern for the interests of the disadvantaged at the grassroots - - plays a positive practical role in safeguarding the sound and rational development of a society and in bringing about a more balanced society through checks and balances .  
However , a small number of rural grass-roots cadres have a poor understanding of their mission to wholeheartedly serve the people .  The work style of these cadres is not down-to-earth , their work approach is simple and rude , they do not feel settled in working at the grassroots , and some of them even seek personal profits abusing their powers and encroach on the masses ' interests .  These problems urgently need to be solved .  
In some places , there are activities of using smuggling and producing fake products as a way to become rich and the dangerous situation of linking crimes of smuggling and manufacturing fake products with local and personal interests .  Some people even protect those who have been engaged in smuggling or producing fake products and create artificial obstacles to " cracking down on smuggling and manufacturing fake products " at the cost of state and overall interests .  
Deputy Chief of General Staff Wu Quanxu , who instructed the drill , claimed that to protect the people 's personal and property safety and to minimize the loss from the possible nuclear accidents , the PLA has established and perfected the rescue and commanding system , whereby the servicemen are combined with the people , the peacetime need is combined with the wartime need , and the three armed services are integrated , and has already possessed the capabilities of providing rapid rescue to all sorts of nuclear accidents .  
Under new circumstances , the political struggles and tests facing officers and men are mainly tasks in daily life , and they rarely experience major personal struggles .  Consequently , some comrades may easily become less politically aware , fail to notice disturbances in their peaceful life , and not be politically vigilant against infiltration of hostile forces .  
Those who deviate from the party 's basic line and behave in a double-dealing manner , those who fail to stand tests at critical moments of the political struggle or hold an ambiguous attitude in an attempt to dodge the struggle , those who disregard the interests of the party and the people and are only keen on seeking personal fame and power through getting official positions by means of bribery or currying favor with influential people or playing defrauds must not be allowed to enter leading bodies .  
We should correct the guiding principle of our tasks , make great efforts to eradicate unhealthy workings styles like bureaucracy , characterized by staying high above reality and soldiers , and formalism , characterized by pursuing unrealistic personal fame and working in a perfunctory manner , so as to improve the comprehensive quality of officers .  
They should also emulate Wang Wei 's lofty ideological character of making selfless dedication , loving and respecting his work , disregarding personal gains and loses , and being indifferent to fame and profit so that they will be able to take the initiative to subordinate themselves to and serve the cardinal needs of reform and construction , cultivate a fine moral character , establish a lofty goal of life , and maintain the unchangeable integrity of revolutionary military personnel .  
It urged them to learn from Wang Wei 's lofty thinking and character of selflessly dedicating himself , devoting himself to his assignment , not being concerned for personal gains and losses , and not being moved by fame and money ; and to self-consciously subject themselves to and serve the general interests of reform and construction , nurture good morality and sentiment , establish lofty goals , and maintain the steadfastness , faithfulness , and moral integrity of a revolutionary soldier .  
His violations of law and disciple are serious and disgusting and have given the public a very bad impression .  This is a typical case of a leading cadre of a law-enforcement department bending the law to serve personal interests and abusing official power for selfish ends .  A severe punishment is absolutely necessary .  
The revised Marriage Law , with the Constitution as the basis , has intensified the legal readjustment to marriage relations and added some provisions regarding the specific issues on personal and property relations in marriage and family spheres .  Meanwhile , it is compatible with China 's national situation , has reflected the aspirations of the broad masses of the people , and is a vital achievement in building our marriage and family laws and systems .  
Among the prohibitive clauses , the revised law has added the stipulations of prohibiting the married people from cohabiting with the persons other than their spouses and prohibiting domestic violence .  This has enhanced , in legislation , the dynamics of safeguarding monogamy and protecting the personal rights of family members .  This has also provided a basis in basic law for stemming unlawful behaviors of this kind through other legal means .  
On behalf of the party central committee and the State Council and also in his personal name , he extended warm congratulations to the entire staff of teachers , students , and other staff of Qinghua University , and extended cordial greetings to teachers , students , and staffs of all institutions of higher education and comrades engaged in educational work throughout the country .  
Thanks to the personal attention and promotion of the heads of state of the two countries , China and Russia have made a big headway and scored notable achievements in mutually beneficial cooperation in the political , economic , scientific and technological , cultural , and educational fields .  
Local governments and masses have taken great pains to persuade and educate them ; and have tried hard to awaken their conscience with love , warm their hearts with deep concern , convert their stubborn beliefs with tolerance , and dispel their superstitious ideas with scientific knowledge .  In the end , they have finally recognized the true colors and the harms of the evil cult , made a clean break from Li Hongzhi , and exposed and condemned the various crimes committed by the " Falungong " with their own personal experiences .

Many commentators have criticized Lee for being preachy , doctrinaire , and relying too much on stage techniques in his movies . Some even accuse him of sensationalism . Lee answers with a disarming , " That 's me , alright !  
While other painters created in their personal studios , she was usually at one hospital or another personally looking after her eldest son who was often on the edge of death . Wang would use her free moments to paint on hospital rags , towels , or cloth that she brought with her . Her paintings were nevertheless serene and joyful , like a rainbow reflecting off a cloud , and filled the room with the freshness of a spring breeze . You could say that she is Taiwan 's most legendary brush and ink artist .  
There 's a final point worth reflecting on : This is only the second direct election for the president in the history of the ROC . Yet the personal characters of the candidates and those around them have already become the main focus of public attention . There 's little discussion of public policy . For example , there 's been virtually no response to the white papers on China policy and constitutional reform issued by Chen Shui-bian .  
According to Zhang Weining , producer for the popular mainland singer Tian Zhen , " A-Mei 's performance style is suited to the outgoing , unrestrained character of the northern Chinese . " He feels that A-Mei is one of the few performers in pop music with a distinctive personal style .  
As such , he proposes that both Taiwan and the mainland issue a yearly white paper on human rights to review fishing disputes , cross-strait marriage and residency , and other human rights issues generated by contact between people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait . The ultimate objective in so doing would be to build up mutual trust by encouraging real interaction at the personal level .  
With such a vigorous network of local volunteers already in place , TCAC was prepared to act quickly when the earthquake hit central Taiwan last September . After zeroing in on Shihkang as the beneficiary of its assistance , TCAC wasted no time in sending relief supplies , establishing a newsletter , and building prefab shelters . In working together on the recovery effort , the people of Peipu and Shihkang have built up close personal ties .  
This system lasted for centuries , until , in the late Qing dynasty , reformers finally abandoned the imperial exam system . But the Four Books remained for many Chinese families a handbook for personal and family life . In Taiwan , even in the Japanese occupation era , education based on the Four Books was never wholly interrupted . And today , in basic textbooks on Chinese culture for middle-school students , not only is a great deal of the material drawn from the Four Books , but the interpretation basically follows that of Zhu Xi .  
Long-term efforts by women 's groups , plus the personal crusades of Yeh and New Party legislator Hsieh Chi-ta , ultimately built momentum in the Legislative Yuan . Finally , after exhaustive lobbying of the Executive Yuan , the Legislative Yuan passed the revision of certain provisions of the family dependents ' section of the civil law in 1996 , providing safeguards for Taiwanese women 's prenuptial property rights and child custody rights . This proved to be the first major step for equal rights between the sexes under law .  
In the future , when everything is connected , information technology will be an inescapable part of daily life . Your personal information will be included in various government or private databanks , to be monitored and processed by those who control these databanks . At the same time , each individual can build a little private Internet of their own , and put everything about themselves in for ease of management .  
When these become common , you will be able to go online through television , wireless application protocol ( WAP ) - standard phones , personal digital assistants ( PDAs ) , and even digital watches . Moreover , you 'll be able to stay connected 24 hours a day . It will be just like TV today-flip it on and you are ready to go .  
His disciples have written over a dozen works of their " personal testaments , " all telling of miracles : being brought back from the brink of death or saved from some calamity . Now that Lee 's organization is gaining more adherents in the Taipei metropolitan area , he has become a somewhat legendary figure . Below is an edited version of our interview with him .  
I wanted to stand up and testify in my personal status-as a writer who was imprisoned , shackled , and beaten because I insisted on freedom of speech and refused to bow down before authoritarianism ; and as a " thought criminal " for whom a military court sought the death penalty-to the fact that the dark ages are over in Taiwan , and that mothers will no longer have to cry for political reasons .  
The growing number of leadership training activities sponsored by Taiwan NGOs mix personal development with professional skills enhancement , religious training , volunteerism and political reform . These programs can help charismatic leaders who are both politically involved and morally upstanding to become greater forces for good . Amid growing cultural diversity , only a new kind of leader with broader , more holistic values will be able to create frameworks suitable to the new era .  
With simple common sense , a basic level of awareness and proper personal hygiene , the public has very little to fear from infectious diseases .  
Like most young people , Robert Huang did n't figure he 'd be making it monstrously big in business , but opportunity came knocking when a group of friends from the Tunghai University department of architecture decided to found an architecture firm and build a residential division where people would be able to establish the close personal ties typical of traditional rural communities while still enjoying all the conveniences of modern apartment life .  
A lot of people in my business have also attended these spiritual growth classes , hoping to break through their personal difficulties , have more harmonious personal relationships , and progress to a higher level at work , " says Chen Tsu-yin . Chen recently entered the insurance business , and this year , despite her great terror about meeting people , won the annual best individual achievement prize given by her company 's customer service department .  
To modern people , divorced from sacred experience and cut off from traditional rituals , Liuh suggests that you can reconstruct your own personal altar , a corner where you can find peace and quiet , undisturbed , where you can listen to your own spirit and connect with the universe , a place where you belong and can always return on your journey through life .  
Courageously facing marriage As a sociologist well aware of the rising divorce rate and the unwillingness of young people to even get hitched because they have seen too many unhappy couples , Hsueh gives some practical advice . While people should make as serious a commitment to marriage as they do to a career , as in a career one can change course or start again . When a marriage really can not be xxxxsustained , divorce should be a socially acceptable alternative , and does not symbolize personal failure or moral bankruptcy .  
Liao Ching-pi , an associate professor of social work at Soochow University and director of the Yoyuen Social Work Foundation , holds strongly to the newer view . Studies done overseas , says Liao , " show that affairs are most likely to happen with men who are unsuccessful in their careers , suffering from sexual dysfunction , or faced with problems in their family or personal relationships that they ca n't handle . "  
Liu was originally trained as an electrical engineer , and in fact served as such for the greater part of his life . He took up the brush during middle age and went on to develop a highly personal style . Later in life , Liu crossed the border into the field of anthropology , making bold expeditions to Africa , Borneo , Latin America , and Oceania . He bounced back and forth between myriad pursuits , and was able to achieve impressive results in each field .  
And an LNG procurement worth several hundred billion New Taiwan dollars is an affair which can be carried out only through a public bidding process in conformance with the WTO spirit of free competition , not one which can be decided by anyone 's personal say-so . Such issues must , as ever , be handled in accordance with legal procedure together with consideration of the national interest .  
In the past , except for special industry databases , sources such as online news sites and all kinds of personal web pages provided an endless wealth of freely accessible information for people browsing the web , leaving little room for the survival of commercial web sites . Even portal sites such as Yam , and Yahoo 's Taiwan subsidiary Kimo , which claimed to have millions of subscribers , were frustrated by their lack of an " excuse " to charge fees .  
And can one who is so in tune with the beat of the universe be equally engaged on a personal level with those about her ? When talk turns to love and friendship , Flor de Loto is unreserved as usual . Popular as a child , she was the object of no little admiration after going to Spain . But her full social life simply enabled her to pour all the more energy into her dancing , without feeling as though she were missing out in other areas of life .  
The draft bill included specific provisions defining political contributions as the outright gift of personal property or real estate , or the provision of other economic benefits , to a person or group participating in an election campaign or otherwise engaged in political activities .  
In Nigeria , Kay actively strove to understand the nation 's medical and healthcare situation . Moreover , he went out on a limb , as a foreigner amid the authoritarian political atmosphere of Nigeria at the time , to write a paper expressing his personal opinions about medicine and education . The paper caused a lot of discussion , with impassioned arguments for and against that really stirred up the local government . He started out excited but ended up alarmed , not knowing if he was bringing good fortune or disaster upon himself .  
The Cultural Bureau of Taichung County last year organized the teachers ' pilgrimage group so as to disseminate understanding of the religious meaning of the pilgrimage and its transforming spiritual power . This year it added groups of volunteers who explained the cultural and historical significance of the festival and recounted their personal experiences with the majesty and power of the tradition .  
From my personal perspective as someone involved in many different fields , and also from the East Asian perspective , this is a good thing . Classical Western art is very structured , and over the centuries has built up a formidable degree of internal consistency . But it is this very internal consistency that turns Western art into a closed system . When art evolves to a certain point , it becomes what is known in Buddhism as " worldly wisdom , " which means to regard " the seeming " as real .  
Public health workers , originally at the frontline of community epidemic prevention , ended up performing menial tasks like delivering lunches and emptying garbage cans . For many people , this was an incredible turn of events . A glance at the history of Taiwan 's public health system showed these workers , deployed at the grassroots level , had a vast reservoir of personal experience and had constituted the primary force in fighting epidemics .  
Who can avoid the reach of multi-media consortiums , with their tremendous financial resources and influence ? They can take in politicians who are down on their luck ; and even those who want to get public exposure to express their own ideas end up surrendering to the media . The result is that no one-neither the idealistic politician nor the deep thinker-ends up staying true to personal principles .  
But it 's a model suitable only to authors willing to demean themselves . As a whole , mainland writers are either concerned with popular urban lit or more focused on their own high personal expectations about their work . Few are candidates to write popular motivational books , let alone take long tours around the country to publicize these books .  
Because of my personal interest in collecting , I 've spent over 20 years doing field research . I 've come in contact with a lot of extremely valuable first-hand materials and seen many aspects of our past that do n't get mentioned in formal historiography . As a result , I 've come to feel strongly that history does n't really come alive unless you approach it from a lot of different angles and look at historical development as something pushed forward by an entire people .  
Asked what areas of personal concern they feel they most need to address , respondents answered , in order of priority : job skills or professional abilities and knowledge ( 30.1% ) ; personal economic or financial situation ( 21.5% ) ; foreign language ability ( 11.2% ) ; level of academic achievement ( 9.6% ) ; quality of life or place of residence ( 5.2% ) ; and religious or spiritual growth ( 2.6% ) .  
Looking at the question from the " support " side , elderly people have more financial and physical ability to look after themselves , so aged parents no longer need to rely on their children . Also , young people are now putting off marriage until much later , so they have much more time under their personal control . Finally , young people have their own marketable skills and incomes , so they do n't need to be under the thumb of their parents . For all these reasons , a carefree life seems a good choice .  
Looking at things from a broader perspective , in terms of societal rather than personal development , the same process seems to happen to the dreams of societies themselves . You could consider the developing nations of the world to be the global equivalent of elementary school students ; as they work toward modernization some make rapid progress , while others creep forward slowly . Both groups , though , keep working toward their goals of modernization , hoping to one day reach the same level of prosperity as their developed brethren .  
In his third year of senior high , in connection with the inauguration of the president of Costa Rica , Wu accepted an invitation to put on a personal exhibit in Central America , but he promised to go only after the school granted him leave . While he was preparing that same academic year for graduation and the equivalency exam , his father fell seriously ill and had to go into the hospital . While at the hospital caring for his father , Wu kept worrying about failing the equivalency exam .  
From finding a " mother structure " of artistic technique close to his own personal tendencies , to overcoming the staid or bewildered aspects of his art and nurturing a " child structure " opposite to his own basic character , Chou 's own perspective on life has changed , so that he has become smoother in the way he deals with people .  
" Exploration is a scientific endeavor , " he says . Aside from fostering personal courage , the ability to conquer fear , and other valuable characteristics , exploring can refine the skills needed for various outdoor activities and help foster discipline and self-improvement . " As a result , I can pass on the techniques I have learned to even more people . This is the main purpose of exploration , " Chen stresses .  
In mid-June , Taipei City Councilor Liu Yao-jen declared at a press conference that he had bought on the Internet personal information on 1,200 primary and middle school students at NT $ 1 a pop from a " name list seller . " All of this data , most of which was on students in the final years of primary school in Sungshan and Hsinyi districts , had been burned onto a CD-ROM , and included the names of the students and their family members , their grade , telephone number , and address .  
Minister of Justice Chen Ding-nan has declared that individuals who have suffered losses because government employees leaked their personal information are entitled to seek compensation from the government . According to existing regulations , the maximum aggregate compensation for a single personal information leak case is only NT $ 20 million . The Ministry of Justice is currently rewriting the law to raise this amount to NT $ 50 million . Department stores and major retailers will also fall under the LPCMPI .  
Tang Yaw-chung , professor in the Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering , National Taiwan University , says that modern technology makes it very easy to copy sound and image data . The more personal data criminals are able to lay their hands on , the harder it is for ordinary people to differentiate between the genuine and the bogus , and the easier it is for them to be taken in .  
At my children 's school , too , there are many truly dedicated teachers who put a lot of effort into running more flexible classes and communicating with parents , making them a part of their children 's education . These teachers have a four-pronged goal for their students : emotional development , life skills , personal growth , and fundamental academic knowledge . Their achievements show that if they work together , the trio of school , teacher , and parents can be a formidable one , and one which opens the door to truly excellent education .

The impact on women varies from the need to fit additional work into an already full and tiring day , to taking on the agricultural work of an absent husband , to additional responsibilities on a husband 's enlarged plot or new production scheme , to the loss of an independent income from her personal plot which has been taken over for family production .

We note with regret that half a year has passed since the signing of the Accra agreement , but that the Liberian parties have not implemented its basic provisions , thus demonstrating a clear disregard for the future of their own country and for the aspirations of its people , a people essentially held hostage to the personal political ambitions of the leaders of the armed factions .  
At least two aspects of traditional culture are very widespread in developing countries and should be taken into consideration in legal reforms regarding public administration : in an oral society , the importance of personal relations and the importance of the group ( the community ) for the individual .  
The importance of these issues varies according to the level of economic development : while to women in the industrialized economies personal taxation issues are of greater importance , in developing countries , where women 's income is often below the taxable threshold , it is the balance between direct and indirect taxation , sectoral taxation policies and the progressiveness of the tax schedule that are relevant to women 's employment and access to productive resources .  
More progressive personal taxation schedules , the choice of joint or individual income as the unit of taxation and reduced reliance on regressive taxation will all tend to be to the advantage of women and will provide incentives for women to seek paid employment .

NULLThe primary stage of financial intermediation is dominated by a combination of a large informal sector where transactions between lenders and borrowers are direct and personal , a currency-creating authority ( a central bank or a currency board ) , and a limited number of deposit-receiving and credit institutions like the commercial banks .  
Five features of these transactions are noteworthy : reciprocity ( " I help you , you help me , when in need " ) ; insignificant transaction costs ; the open-ended ( no fixed maturity ) nature of many of these financial contracts ; the informality of screening devices ( personal knowledge of borrowers ) used in making loans ; and the informal sanctions ( such as social shunning of delinquents ) employed to enforce contracts .

I have recently intensified my personal contacts with the heads of the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization , as well as with other executive heads .
