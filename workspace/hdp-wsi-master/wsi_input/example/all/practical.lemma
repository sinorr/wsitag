Wang Dongjin spoke at the 92nd International Labor Organization Conference , saying that facing the challenges and difficulties of globalization , developing countries should enact feasible economic and sustainable social developmental strategies according to their countries ' situations .  Advanced countries and international organizations should provide the developing countries with a more practical and effective technical assistance to raise their ability to participate in the globalization process , thus allowing them to enjoy fairly the fruits of economic globalization from which common prosperity and development of the world can be realized .  
Wen Jiabao suggested organizing all Party leading cadres to seriously study the important speech made by Comrade Jiang Zemin at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission , deeply carrying out the spirit of the plenary session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission , working in line with the actual condition of the financial sector , setting up specific measures and taking practical actions to carry forward improving the Party ï¿½s work style and building a clean and honest government and fighting corruption within the financial sector .  
constitutes a fundamental guiding ideology for China 's educational reform and development under the historical conditions of socialist market economic development , reform , and opening up ; serves as a guide to action for deepening educational reform and promoting quality education in an all-around manner ; and has great , practical significance as a guide as well as far-reaching historical significance .  
At the same time , in order to enhance the consciousness , foreseeability , and effectiveness of practical activities , we should base all major policy decisions on scientific research and adequate proofs ; and base all scientific forecasts and management on a correct understanding of the objective law of the society .  
Comrade Jiang Zemin 's remarks have , from a high plane of historical materialism , revealed the fundamental nature of our party ; pointed out the party 's basic tasks ; and are of an important theoretical and practical significance to our efforts to further maintain the advancement of the party , retain the vigor and vitality of the party , lead the whole party and the people of the entire country to carry out struggles in unity , and build our country into a prosperous , strong , democratic , and civilized modern socialist power .  
The practical industrial structural adjustment has laid a sound industrial foundation for Hainan , enabling the province 's economy to develop rapidly and the economic results to improve ; as a result , the quality of its economic growth has improved notably .  
Having gone through the change from " getting rich overnight " to " working in the light of the reality , " many Hainan deputies said with deep reflection : Industrial structural adjustment must be carried out in the light of local conditions and we must be pragmatic .  Only by doing so can we achieve practical results and ensure sustainable economic and social development .  
In view of this , we feel it a must to integrate the work of returning grain plots with the development of the rural economy , and with the task of extricating peasants from poverty and making them rich ; and a must to find practical and earnest solutions to major problems that are most concerned by the masses , such as sufficient food and firewood as well as increases in their income .  Only in this way can we do a good job in protecting the ecological environment from the basics .  
The basic spirit of the speech is suited to the county ( or city ) level as well as to the leadership at various levels ; the speech is particularly aimed at improving the ideological and political qualities of leading cadres at various levels ; so it is of great practical and far-reaching historical significance .  
Qiao Xiaoyang said : Tremendous achievements have been scored in our country 's legislation work , but some problems have also cropped up in practical legislative work as legislation progresses at an accelerated pace and the number of laws enacted multiplies , such as legislation in excess of legal power , conflict and contradiction between different laws , regulations , and rules , low legislative quality , and lack of democratic procedures in legislation .  
Practice has proven that the central authorities ' series of policy decisions and arrangements are completely correct , practical , and effective , and have laid the foundation and pointed out the orientation for us to explore and embark on an anticorruption path suited to our basic national condition in the current stage .  
This should be of important theoretical and practical significance to our party under the new historical conditions in further strengthening self building , always maintaining advanced nature , leading the people of the whole country in waging concerted struggles , pushing forward reform and opening up and modernization building , and realizing the magnificent transcentury objectives .  
Introducing able personnel from other parts of the country is , no doubt , a major channel ; yet it is more practical and more economical to arouse the potentialities of existing scientific and technological personnel inside the region .  Besides , the large-scale development of the western region has also provided a rare historical opportunity for the able personnel in the military industry to attain greater accomplishments in their career .  
and a fundamental change to the outlook of the western region entails the persevering and indomitable efforts of several generations .  They should persistently proceed their work from the reality , draw up an overall plan for the work , suit their measures to local conditions , give a better play to local advantages , strive for practical results , and work hard to open up a new road for the region 's large-scale exploration and development that suits both the special features of the western region and the needs of a socialist market economic system .  
In his speech , Yu Yongbo , member of the Central Military Commission , and director of the General Political Department , demanded all levels of the military to strengthen ideological and political work , teach the military-turned-cadres to consolidate the concept of taking in the interests of the whole into account , fully understanding the difficulties of local governments and the units that take in the demobilized army officers , and supporting the economic construction and various reforms of the state by practical deeds .  
In the face of new changes taking place in the domestic and international situation and new development in ideological education for young people , we feel deeply that Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech has a clear objective , that it targets at the current problems , and that it is of great practical meaning , and it has made us realize even more the urgency and difficult nature of young people 's ideological education .  
Fourth , it is necessary to further improve the body of public security laws and regulations and comprehensively push forward the codification of public security work into the legal system and the building of the police force .  The 15th national party congress put forward the objectives and requirements for establishing and improving the socialist legal system .  It is necessary to go by these objectives and requirements and cater to the practical needs of public security work , making timely adjustments to the plans for , and pace of , public security legislative work ;  
It is necessary to adhere to the principle of doing ideological and political work and doing economic and vocational work at the same time .  Ideological and educational work should permeate practical work , and the actual results in ideological and political work should be increased .  
On the basis of its geopolitics and its domestic and foreign " realistic " situation , Russia has gradually formed its own unique " practical containment " nuclear strategy : to prevent the outbreak of a nuclear war and a large-scale conventional war by means of nuclear deterrence and to first use nuclear weapons in a regional war , local war or armed conflict to attain the goal of safeguarding national security and maintaining the status of a big country .  
In doing practical work , first political commissars should resolve problems in a timely manner , study and arrange the major work of reserve forces , clearly understand the ideological pulse of leading cadres , and organize and convene meetings to study and resolve major problems so as to ensure that reserve forces are developing toward a correct orientation .  
The party committee of this brigade learned from its investigations that alongside the deepening and development of reform and opening up , some cadres and soldiers were lacking in a necessary mental preparation for the impacts that had been exerted on their personal interests by certain reform polices of the state and the army ; and when faced with practical problems , such as the layoff of their family members and an increasingly difficult situation in the resettlement of demobilized armymen , these cadres and soldiers would usually feel puzzled and would develop doubts and misgivings .  
Every enterprise is required to carry out the activity in the light of its own realistic conditions , draw up practical and workable measures for the improvement of its management , strive for marked breakthroughs in the aspect of improving its weak links , and ensure that its management can scale a new height this year .  
They should not only use scientific theories to arm themselves and to guide their practical work , but should also show a thirst for knowledge ; make hard efforts to master the knowledge of modern finance , science and technology , and the law ; familiarize themselves with the operational rules of the international market , and learn from the management of multinational companies ;  
The realistic and practicable measures as such enabled the simultaneous realization of graceful image and practical functions and prominent economic benefits .  Consequently The small victories were accumulated into a big one and the quantitative changes resulted in a qualitative change .  
All types of educational institutions at all levels and all educators in the country are shouldering a solemn mission .  They should have a fundamental aim of improving the quality of our nationals , give priority to cultivating the students ' innovativeness and practical abilities , and try hard to bring up developers of and successors to the socialist cause who achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development .  
and we should learn from them in taking a firm stance and clearly distinguishing between right and wrong , cherish the excellent situation of stability and unity , and resolutely wage struggle against phenomena that jeopardize ethnic solidarity , national security , and social stability , as practical deeds for preserving social and political stability .  
Using network resources and conducting research on the question of launching a people 's war on the net are of strong practical significance in making good preparations for military struggle .  In addition , they are also of profound and far-reaching historical significance in developing the strategic ideology of launching people 's war .  
The 80 years of practical experience since the founding of our Party have fully demonstrated that our Party will win the heartfelt embrace and support from the people and will win over this source of inexhaustible power as long as our Party consistently adheres to taking the people 's interests as the starting point of everything and formulate its lines , strategies and policies that comply with the demand for developing advanced productive forces , the advancing direction of progressive culture and the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .  
We need both an overall objective for the entire military and focused practical missions for all military branches and theater troops , confirming different separate goals , remembering not to blindly push for expediency , or go into grandiose projects .  
Around the two historic questions of how to " fight and win " and how one does " not become degenerate , " we now should emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , smash the trammels of outmoded ideas and the old way of thinking , earnestly study new situations and problems , and explore new ideas , new methods , and new ways to solve major practical problems in the armed forces in order to keep raising the level of army building .  
Now , the battalion has built 12 modern teaching sites with coordinated equipment , such as electronic classrooms , rooms for simulation of animated images , and rooms for simulation of traffic rules .  In addition , it has incorporated use of three-dimensional animated pictures in teaching of basic theories , use of multi-media in explaining the technological structures , and use of simulation in practical application and operation .  As a result , the effectiveness of basic training of trainee soldiers has been improved by three times .  
Doing a conscientious job of economic protection is of major practical significance and far-reaching strategic significance with regard to improving the overall defensive capabilities of cities , avoiding or reducing economic losses during wartime , preserving combat potential , and prevailing in war , as well as with regard to having a stable economy during peacetime , developing production , ensuring supply and demand , and safeguarding a stable and unified political situation .  
Cultivating military cadres with the assistance of civilian colleges and universities is an inevitable choice made to adapt to the world 's military development trends , to the " Two fundamental changes " in our military construction and to the needs for " winning wars " in the future .  It is a practical step in carrying out and implementing the essence of Chairman Jiang 's directives .  
Among these innovations , the solar-energy chargers for three kinds of practical storage batteries that are easy to carry , can be carried in vehicles and are movable were developed by the military transportation and traffic section that took the lead in the whole army in using solar energy batteries to replace the charge of batteries with electricity .  They were developed in line with the characteristics that they are used for air force vehicles and for supporting purpose .  The development has resolved the major difficulties in providing support for air force vehicles for many years .  
Since the 1960s and 1970s , many countries and regions of Asia have taken a practical approach , implementing development strategies of catching up and surpassing , rising quickly from the post-war ruins , achieving sustained and rapid economic growth , greatly improving the standard of living of the people , and writing a new chapter in the promotion of world economic development .  
In the face of air threat under the modern high-tech conditions , the most practical issues lying before the air defense forces in making sound preparations for the military struggle are to create a new theory of operation , new contents of training , new methods of training , and a new ground antiaircraft operational command system by centering on " winning " the future war with anti-air raid as its main aspect so as to meet the needs of future anti-air raid operations .  
closely center our efforts around the need to enhance our ability of " winning the war " ; conscientiously summarize the practical experiences of the troops ; and strive to create flexible and diversified methods of operation , intensive and highly efficient methods of training , and scientific and standardized methods of management .  
The Asian financial crisis has given us a practical lesson .  Financial security is no longer a pure economic issue .  It has a bearing on the political and social security of a country and is part and parcel of national security .  
In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin enunciated a series of fundamental theoretical and practical issues that have a bearing on the overall situation , gave a new summary to the status of ideological and political work in the overall tasks of the party and the state , and also set forth new requirements .  
To implement the policy of managing the party strictly , the most fundamental measure is to draw up a set of practical and binding rules and mechanisms to strengthen ideological and institutional construction at the same time , to give full scope to the role of party committees being the leading cores , the role of party branches being the fighting fortresses , and the role of party members being vanguards and models .  
Meanwhile , we should ensure that military talented personnel have a general understanding of literature , history , philosophy , economy , mathematics , science , engineering , chemistry , biology , and other aspects of knowledge .  With such a background as well as with hard work in practical fields , these people can be all-round persons who can comprehensively utilize various fields of modern knowledge and are equipped with command , professional , and other skills all at the same time .  
At the central conference on ideological and political work , Chairman Jiang clearly pointed out : " On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions , we must strive to innovate in and improve the contents , forms , methods , means , mechanisms , and other aspects of our ideological and political work ; we must especially increase the purposefulness and practical results of this work and enhance our initiative in this regard .  
At the same time , he also pointed out a number of problems that were currently existing in the province 's press and propaganda work .  For example , the time effectiveness of the press work still remains poor , news coverage lacks a required depth , the contents of news reports tend to be identical , some newspapers have showed vulgar tastes , and a handful of publications have even failed to keep to a correct opinion orientation .  All these need to be overcome with hard efforts in the practical work in the future .  
During the course of scientific and technological military training , more and more commanders and fighters are seeking truth and practical results , emphasizing applicability , wholeness , and actual combat application , and improving their real ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
The efforts to seek truth and practical results have made each and every flower of reform in the scientific and technological military training bear the fruit of enhancing the troops ' ability of " winning in war " .  Some difficult questions concerning fighting under high-tech conditions have been effectively solved .  
In the drill , on one hand , this department attached prime importance to theoretical study , scientifically analyzed and evaluated the present situation of the theater 's support capacity , especially its own units , and comprehensively grasped the characteristics of the theater 's topography , weather , social situation , popular feelings , and the actual conditions of the equipment and combat readiness , and provided guidance for troops ' practical work .  
The " opinion " also proposes explicit requirements on solutions to many realistic problems in ideological and political construction throughout military academies and universities .  These five documents were formulated in accordance with the " Opinion " on the basis of extensive investigation and study , sufficient solicitation of opinions from every field and repeated study and proof .  They are targeted and practical .  
All the achievements in military theory research presented this time deal with major practical questions concerning preparation for military struggle and furthering of scientific and technological military training , with focus on key and difficult questions concerning combined-arms joint operations , air assault and air defense .  They are the result of thorough exploration of the characteristics and law of fighting and scientific and technological military training under the high-tech conditions .  They serve specific purposes , and they are highly directive and feasible , reflecting the latest achievements made by the PLA in military theory research .  
B : The new challenges and new opportunities require us to have the correct , proper new ideas that go with the flow but also are realistic and practical for us .  Our economic construction should never again embark on a developmental path of extensive expansion .  We should no longer pursue rapid growth only in terms of the total economic volume .  
the legal system of market economy is still unsound , the phenomenon of corruption is spread wide , and there are plenty of ecological environmental problems and so on .  All these are pressing practical issues with an impact on our country 's national economic and social development , which must be tackled through market-oriented reforms .  
At the same time , in innovating training methods and means , it is necessary to adhere to a scientific truth-seeking attitude , prevent and overcome the unrealistic practice of going in for grandiose projects and things foreign , the practice of seeking novelty and surprise without paying attention to practical results , and the practice of being overanxious for quick results , a practice that runs counter to laws .  
The second generation of the Party leadership with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at its core as well as the third generation of the Party leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core restored , upheld and advanced the ideological line of " emancipate one 's thinking , be practical and realistic " , and led the entire party and the entire Chinese people in concentrating efforts on reforms and opening to the outside world , such that China has been seeing miraculous economic and social growth .  
The resolution of key and difficult problems certainly does not lie in shouting slogans more loudly .  It lies in starting out with a recognition of reality , revolving around real problems of widespread concern to the broad masses of officers and soldiers , thinking of practical moves , taking real action , and working steadily and surely to solve the problems .  
The spirit of struggling hard and obtaining practical results demands that we carry forward the fine spirit of the party , build up our country through hard work and frugality , be industrious and thrifty in managing all undertakings and vigorously carry forward the fine work style of speaking the plain truth , seeking practical results and trying our best to fulfill our responsibility .  The spirit of not hankering after fame and fortune and tendering selfless devotion has demanded that we always think of the people and the party 's cause .  
We must hold aloft the banner of ethnic solidarity and progress , vigorously propagate the party 's ethnic and religious policies , and do more practical and good things for the minority-nationality masses , to consolidate the excellent situation of people of all nationalities breathing the same air , sharing the same destiny , and being linked heart to heart .  
In his speech , Yu Yongbo pointed out : The current education drive is an important move and practical step taken on the basis of positive education in " three stresses " carried out in party committees at the regimental level and grassroots units of the armed forces to further study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " , improve the quality of the ranks of party members , and strengthen party building in the armed forces .  
To be more specific , the ideology of an all-embracing government takes the goal conception of equalitarianism as the basis of social integration , whereas in the case of post-omnipotenism with Chinese characteristics , political integration is primarily founded on the authority of the state apparatus and the system , yet the utopian " political myth " embodied in a dogmatic ideology has already been abandoned , and efforts have been made to try to gain the people 's recognition of state power with " practical economic results . "  
To be more specific , the interaction between these diverse values and theories - - liberalists ' pursuit of democracy , personal freedom and enlightenment ; neo-conservatives ' affirmation of the need for political order and stability in the course of modernization and development ; and the New Left 's concern for the interests of the disadvantaged at the grassroots - - plays a positive practical role in safeguarding the sound and rational development of a society and in bringing about a more balanced society through checks and balances .  
During the period of the 10th Five-Year Plan , we should work closely around the goal of expanding domestic demand and adopt practical and effective macroeconomic fiscal policy and monetary policy to stimulate domestic market demand for investment and consumption in order to promote economic growth and upgrade the industrial structure .  
In short , our theoretical work must be closely combined with the realities , take the major practical issues in reform , opening up , and modernization as the main direction of attack in our study , positively probe into the law governing economic , political , and cultural development in building socialism with Chinese characteristics , serve the party and government in making scientific policy decisions , and serve the entire party and nation in working for the interest of the whole .  
Zhang Ming , commander of this unit , said when interviewed by our reporter : " We feel very proud of Wang Wei , this fine comrade-in-arms ; Wang Wei is the hero in our mind and the model for us to emulate ; we will turn righteous anger into strength , faithfully carry out our duties , study assiduously , train hard in the skills for killing the enemy , show no fear in the face of strong enemies , and defend the motherland 's dignity and territorial integrity with practical action . "  
The responsibility of the incident completely lies on the US side .  The Chinese Government filed a protest and made solemn representations to the US Government over the US act violating international law , encroaching on China 's airspace and sovereignty , and compromising China 's national security and interests , demanding that the United States undertake full responsibility for the incident , apologize to the Chinese people , and take practical and effective measures to prevent a recurrence of similar incidents .  
On the basis of doing a good job in the existing projects , the two countries should carry out bilateral cooperation in the development of information industry , bioengineering , pharmaceuticals , and new materials , and accelerate the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into practical productive forces to better serve the economic construction of respective countries .  
After the news of the US Government 's apology to our nation for the " plane collision incident " was announced , cadres and the masses everywhere believe that this is an interim accomplishment in our government 's and people 's reasonable , beneficial , and restrained struggle against US hegemony .  The people have expressed firm support for the correct decisions adopted by our government regarding this incident and have strenuously requested that the United States immediately stop conducting surveillance activities along our coast and take practical measures to prevent this kind of incident from happening again .  
It has not only failed to make progress in formulating policies or in implementing practical measures for enhancing cross-strait political mutual trust .  On the contrary , it has regressed in this regard .  In particular , let us take as examples some recent events including the " Chin Mei-ling incident , " the " incident of Yoshinori Kobayashi 's entry to Taiwan , " and the " incident where Japan revised a textbook on historic facts on Japan 's invasion into China . "  
Under a huge banner with a slogan , " Emulate Wang Wei 's spirit and toughen the strong amphibious contingent , " officers and men of the " hard bone sixth company " carried out the most practical and lively education in fostering lofty ideals and conviction .  
Second , new progress was made in the work of training and educating young cadres .  Through theoretical training , practical exercise , and routine education and management , the ideological and political quality of the young cadres was enhanced , and their ability to do organizational work and exercise leadership was also enhanced .  
We should target the characteristic that most logistical science and technology have military and civilian applications as we vigorously bring in local advanced and practical scientific and technological results , put civilian work to military use and promptly turn them into a military economic benefit , so that they can provide a service and boost our safeguard capability .  We should pay attention to using society 's R &amp; D capability to accelerate the strong pace of using scientific and technological advancement to achieve security .  
All localities , in the light of local situations , should clearly set the objectives , focus on key tasks , and strive to achieve practical results .  We should not only decidedly wipe out criminal forces and pressure groups already uncovered , but also should expose criminal forces and pressure groups that have been lying low and have not been exposed and clamp down on them .  
Article 4 .  National defense education shall be based on the principle of participation by the whole people , long-term perseverance , and seeking practical results ; the principle of combining regular education with concentrated education , universal education with focused education , and theoretical education with behavioral education should be pursued ; and its implementation should be organized by category , with the contents of education determined according to different recipients of education .  
Putin emphasized : President Jiang Zemin 's visit to Russia is a major event in Russian-Chinese relations this year ; and it has extremely important practical and historical significance .  I am very delighted to be able to have a thorough exchange of views with President Jiang on ways to continuously enrich and deepen the strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries , and to promote and strengthen bilateral cooperation in world affairs in the coming century .  
They must vigorously carry forward the spirit of ceaselessly striving to achieve socialist modernization , emancipate their minds , seek truth from facts , keep abreast of the times , be bold in innovation , and forge ahead irrespective of the difficulties ; they should press forward with indomitable will , work hard , seek practical results , refrain from seeking fame and wealth , dedicate themselves in selfless fashion , take firm footing in their work posts , love their work , whatever it is , and study and become proficient in it .  
Instead , they should raise questions based on their local conditions and solve the questions in a way suited to their local conditions .  On the one hand , they should not act too fast .  Rather , they should focus on one or two striking questions in practical work as a starting point , press ahead step by step , and develop their work in the course of progress .  
The key to studying for the purpose of application lies in guiding the broad ranks of cadres to combine theoretical study with the study of practical issues and conscientiously enhance their abilities to analyze and solve practical issues using scientific theory in close connection with the new changes in the international situation , the new advances in China 's drive of reform and opening up to the outside world and socialism modernization as well , and the new developments and new problems facing our party building .  
We must persist in focusing our vision on enhancing the overall qualities of the rural grassroots cadres , on resolving current conspicuous problems in the rural areas , and on safeguarding and developing the interests of the peasants ; in particular , we should do a number of practical things centering on rural economic development , to improve rural production and living conditions and make efforts to increase peasant incomes .  
Huang Qingyi said : Xu Rongkai has worked in both local and central departments and committees , including organs of the State Council . He is familiar with the work of macroeconomic management and social development and has rather rich practical experience in these fields .  He has a good knowledge of theories and policies , strong writing skills , and remarkable organizing and coordinating ability .  
Wang Zhaoguo stressed : Recently Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized the need to adhere to the four cardinal principles .  For us , this is a practical and effective guidance , which will enable us to keep a sober political mind , uphold the correct political orientation of the united front work , enhance our ideal and confidence in the party and achieve still greater success in doing the united front work .  
Through the previous period of study , the majority of Party members in the military have obtained a certain level of awareness and understanding of the rich content and political , theoretical and practical meaning of the important thinking of the " three represents " .  However , this important thinking is broad , extensive and profound , with very rich content .  
We should , in accordance with the characteristics of this educational campaign , satisfactorily conduct programs to study , supervise and discuss crucial and specific issues and topics , understand Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of the " three represents " in association with the Marxist theory on Party-building , consider this thinking in accordance with the positive and negative experiences of the CPC and parties of foreign countries , and study this thinking in association with replying and solving the significant theoretical and practical issues we are facing at present .  
On the basis of meticulously reviewing the positive and negative experiences , recollecting its courage and confidence and correcting its mistakes , the party established and adhered to the ideological line of seeking the truth from facts , gradually understood the practical situation of China , created a road of " circling cities with rural areas and taking over political power through arms " ? which suited the Chinese practical situation and won the victory of a modern national democratic revolution .  
He further hoped that the quality education base for youths and the science and technology hall will extend the quality education of schools and allow every middle and elementary school student to be trained and nurtured in creative thinking , willpower and moral character , physical health , environmental protection sense , and capability in practical living .  
The ministers unanimously held that it is necessary to further strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation , push forward the process of trade and investment liberalization and facilitation within APEC , and step up economic and technical cooperation in order to meet challenges of the new century with practical action .  
All localities and departments should conscientiously implement the spirit of the central instructions , take practical and effective measures to guarantee water supply for cities and drinking water for people and livestock in rural areas and , through structural adjustments and major efforts to save on water , strive to do a good job in industrial and agricultural production .  
This important directive fully demonstrates that firmly establishing the viewpoint of the masses , adhering to the line of the masses and solving practical problems faced by the masses are crucial to strengthening and improving party-building .  This directive explicitly points out the direction for our current educational campaign to study and practice the important thinking of the " three represents " and maintain the advanced nature of party members .  
When practical problems faced by the masses are solved , their ideological problems will be solved immediately .  The majority of officers and soldiers will have a stronger conviction in firmly trusting the party , loving the party and being firm in following the party .  In this way , our planned objective of promoting the educational campaign to study and practice the important thinking of the " three represents " and maintain the advanced nature of party members will be realized .  
It is necessary to meet the requirements in the development of the times and the modernization drive , set aright the guiding ideas for education , change the education concepts , orient education to the cultivation of students ' innovative spirit of practical capability , enable students to master the basic knowledge , basic skills , and methods for their lifetime studies , and develop their physical and mental health in their growth .  
Nearly 20-million rural cadres and grass-roots cadres in China have mastered one practical technology or two , and among them , 3-million people won primary professional technical titles and 500,000 people won secondary professional technical titles . 
The " Shanghai Spirit " , which has been developed during the process of the " Shanghai Five " , shows the characteristics of mutual trust and benefit , equality , consultation , mutual respect to different civilizations , and common prosperity .  The spirit is not only the summary of the experiences the five states have gained in handling relations with others , but is also of practical significance in pushing forward a just and rational new order of international politics and economy .  
The " Shanghai spirit " cultivated by the Shanghai Five process of mutual trust , mutual benefit , equality , consultation , respect for cultural pluralism , and seeking common development , is a summary of the experiences of the five countries in handling mutual relations ; in addition , it is of important practical significance in promoting the establishment of a new international political and economic order of justice and reason .  
All military forces closely united this educational campaign with the practical struggle and the reality of the thinking of officers and soldiers and distinguishing the right and wrong regarding crucial and major issues .  
Liu Yunshan said : In various historical periods in which the CPC leads revolution , construction and reform , its propaganda and ideological work plays a very important role in disseminating the scientific truth , promoting the integration of Marxism with the practical reality in China , uniting with , mobilizing and rallying the masses , fulfilling historical tasks in various periods , advocating advanced moral practice and scientific and civilized way of life , and improving the ideological , moral , scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation .  
The two major theoretical results are the crystallization of the practical experience and collective wisdom of the party and the people , the valuable spiritual wealth of our party , and the great banner that guides us to advance triumphantly .  
The key to upholding Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in the new historical period lies in persistent use of Deng Xiaoping Theory to observe the present-day world and contemporary China , incessantly sum up practical experience and generalize it in the new theoretical light and open up new ways forward .  
To remain keen in mastering the development trend and requirements of China 's productive forces and take practical steps to promote the constant development of advanced productive forces by making economic development the central task and formulating and implementing a correct line , principles , and policies are the fundamental manifestations and requirements for our party to stand in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
When fathers of Marxism hold such an open and dynamic attitude towards their classical works , why do we have to be dogmatic , worship books and be restrained to some expositions and specific practical programs they proposed in specific historical conditions and concrete situations ?  
In his " 1 July " speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin gave a penetrating exposition on the important concept of " three represents " and put forward new ideas and views on a number of major theoretical and practical issues concerning party building and the socialist modernization drive , thereby pointing out the direction for advancing the cause of the party and the country in the coming century .  
It comprehensively summed up the glorious course and basic experiences of the party , systematically expounded the important concept of " three represents , " explicitly set the basic requirements of strengthening and improving party building , and profoundly answered major theoretical and practical questions of fundamental importance with a bearing on the overall situation , about which people had been concerned .  
For this reason , the United States began to reconsider China 's strength and ponder if its excessively radical policy to contain and isolate China had damaged US strategic interests and practical economic interests .  It is against this background that US Secretary of State Powell plans to visit Beijing in July and Bush is scheduled to visit China and meet with President Jiang Zemin in October , in a hope to establish constructive relations with China .  
We , cadres at the basic level in rural areas , should strengthen our self-cultivation , grasp more knowledge of agricultural science and technology , really " represent the progressive course of the advanced culture " in our villages , and strive to do more practical work for the common people .  
To improve the party 's leadership and party building , we must first proceed from these two major transformations to earnestly study theoretical and practical issues facing party building under the new historical conditions and study the laws governing the rule of the country by the Communist Party , socialist construction , and the development of human society that underlie these issues so as to better advance party building .  
To study and resolve major party building issues in the spirit of reform , we would have to - - in accordance with practical criteria , particularly the criteria of the " three represents " - - test and examine the various aspects of the party 's ideological , political , organizational , and workstyle development to see whether they meet the requirements of the " three represents " and are proved through practice to be correct and effective .  
and go down to the basic level and enterprises more frequently to immerse ourselves among the vast numbers of masses in agricultural and pastoral areas , indicated Legqog .

Even under the situation where the United States and the south Korean authorities defiantly opposed the DPRK 's proposal for tripartite talks , the great leader took the positive step of mobilizing 150,000 Korean People 's armymen for peaceful construction in 1986 to defuse the tension on the Korean peninsula and advanced a proposal on 23 July 1987 for a massive phased reduction of the armed forces and declared a unilateral reduction of 100,000 of the People 's Army forces as a subsequent practical measure .  
The main lesson that we should draw from the limited success of past efforts in this regard is that the legal , political and practical complexity of the issues involved makes it impossible to apply ready-made , generalized solutions .  
The presence of the multinational protection force affectively blocked the risk of Albania sliding towards anarchy or even internal political conflict and allowed the various international organizations and individual States willing to provide practical help to Albania to organize assistance in a secure environment .

UNDCP has been constrained from moving forward as quickly as anticipated with its alternative development programme in Afghanistan , in view of the continuing political situation and practical considerations .  
UNCTAD has also concluded that it is not practical to prescribe a specific curriculum for general knowledge since this is a function of many different cultural , sociological and environmental factors , and should be decided at the national level .

IACWGE continues its work to develop practical support for gender mainstreaming . 20 In a number of other areas , as proposed by CCPOQ , it would be important to further fine tune the cross-cutting themes identified at the world conferences , starting from the 12 themes agreed by the Council ( see E / 1995 / 86 ) with a view to identifying more selective and better defined issues that would benefit from a coordinated approach and supportive tools . 
Its membership has been growing day by day and civil society has begun to identify with it as a solid basis for the hope that nuclear disarmament efforts may prove successful in the future if they take the form of firm , practical and effective steps , as reflected in General Assembly resolution 53 / 77 Y .  
Rather than the easy path of headline _ grabbing , seductive , hasty and ultimately utopian disarmament , we have always preferred the more demanding path of serene , practical , well thought _ out and for that very reason realistic disarmament ; that path is the only guarantee of the security of each State , large or small , and for that very reason an assurance of greater security for all .  
Consequently , the Special Rapporteur has already expressed the view that indigenous peoples , although they may constitute numerical minorities in a number of the countries in which they now live , are not minorities in accordance with United Nations usage and for the purposes of possible practical action on the part of the Organization . 24 / By the same token , ethnic and / or national minorities are not to be considered indigenous peoples in the United Nations context . 
Having completed his research , the Special Rapporteur considers that it may be useful to review the above list , so as to determine - at least provisionally - what would be the most practical and fruitful means ( i.e . treaty / agreement renegotiation and / or proper implementation , constructive arrangement , resort to international bodies , or some other formula ) of constructively approaching , in the future , the wide array of current situations confronting those peoples mentioned above .  
Particular consideration should be given , in these cases , to the practical day-to-day consequences ( sometimes grave ) of the lack of such agreements for the juridical and political status of the peoples concerned in the mixed societies in which they now live , and for the preservation , promotion and effective realization of their historical rights as peoples , including their human rights and freedoms .

In view of the apparent lack of international consensus on the principles embodied in the Moon Agreement , as shown by its relatively low level of ratification , it is likely that practical issues relating to the ownership of and equitable access to such resources should will require further substantial consideration and study within the field of international law .  
No single aspect , including FDI , should be treated in isolation but rather as part of an interdependent whole that would equally include practical applications : investment promotion agencies , investment and technological policy reviews , investment guides for LDCs , and negotiation of bilateral or regional investment treaties among developing countries .

He had concluded that that was not necessary either for practical reasons ( it would be extremely difficult , if not impossible , to establish a clear-cut violation of internal law in respect of reservations ) or for technical reasons ( the internal procedure in respect of reservations is often empirical and difficult of access ) ; there , too , the Commissions opinion would be valuable to him . 
It was also stated that continued discussion on highly theoretical issues related to the topic tended to diminish the relative and fragile clarity which had been achieved and , in this connection , the point was made that approaching the topic in more practical terms could be more conducive to making progress on it .

and a fundamental change to the outlook of the western region entails the persevering and indomitable efforts of several generations .  They should persistently proceed their work from the reality , draw up an overall plan for the work , suit their measures to local conditions , give a better play to local advantages , strive for practical results , and work hard to open up a new road for the region 's large-scale exploration and development that suits both the special features of the western region and the needs of a socialist market economic system .  
In his speech , Yu Yongbo , member of the Central Military Commission , and director of the General Political Department , demanded all levels of the military to strengthen ideological and political work , teach the military-turned-cadres to consolidate the concept of taking in the interests of the whole into account , fully understanding the difficulties of local governments and the units that take in the demobilized army officers , and supporting the economic construction and various reforms of the state by practical deeds .  
In the face of new changes taking place in the domestic and international situation and new development in ideological education for young people , we feel deeply that Comrade Jiang Zemin 's speech has a clear objective , that it targets at the current problems , and that it is of great practical meaning , and it has made us realize even more the urgency and difficult nature of young people 's ideological education .  
Fourth , it is necessary to further improve the body of public security laws and regulations and comprehensively push forward the codification of public security work into the legal system and the building of the police force .  The 15th national party congress put forward the objectives and requirements for establishing and improving the socialist legal system .  It is necessary to go by these objectives and requirements and cater to the practical needs of public security work , making timely adjustments to the plans for , and pace of , public security legislative work ;  
It is necessary to adhere to the principle of doing ideological and political work and doing economic and vocational work at the same time .  Ideological and educational work should permeate practical work , and the actual results in ideological and political work should be increased .  
On the basis of its geopolitics and its domestic and foreign " realistic " situation , Russia has gradually formed its own unique " practical containment " nuclear strategy : to prevent the outbreak of a nuclear war and a large-scale conventional war by means of nuclear deterrence and to first use nuclear weapons in a regional war , local war or armed conflict to attain the goal of safeguarding national security and maintaining the status of a big country .  
In doing practical work , first political commissars should resolve problems in a timely manner , study and arrange the major work of reserve forces , clearly understand the ideological pulse of leading cadres , and organize and convene meetings to study and resolve major problems so as to ensure that reserve forces are developing toward a correct orientation .  
The party committee of this brigade learned from its investigations that alongside the deepening and development of reform and opening up , some cadres and soldiers were lacking in a necessary mental preparation for the impacts that had been exerted on their personal interests by certain reform polices of the state and the army ; and when faced with practical problems , such as the layoff of their family members and an increasingly difficult situation in the resettlement of demobilized armymen , these cadres and soldiers would usually feel puzzled and would develop doubts and misgivings .  
Every enterprise is required to carry out the activity in the light of its own realistic conditions , draw up practical and workable measures for the improvement of its management , strive for marked breakthroughs in the aspect of improving its weak links , and ensure that its management can scale a new height this year .  
They should not only use scientific theories to arm themselves and to guide their practical work , but should also show a thirst for knowledge ; make hard efforts to master the knowledge of modern finance , science and technology , and the law ; familiarize themselves with the operational rules of the international market , and learn from the management of multinational companies ;  
The realistic and practicable measures as such enabled the simultaneous realization of graceful image and practical functions and prominent economic benefits .  Consequently The small victories were accumulated into a big one and the quantitative changes resulted in a qualitative change .  
All types of educational institutions at all levels and all educators in the country are shouldering a solemn mission .  They should have a fundamental aim of improving the quality of our nationals , give priority to cultivating the students ' innovativeness and practical abilities , and try hard to bring up developers of and successors to the socialist cause who achieve all-round moral , academic , physical , and artistic development .  
and we should learn from them in taking a firm stance and clearly distinguishing between right and wrong , cherish the excellent situation of stability and unity , and resolutely wage struggle against phenomena that jeopardize ethnic solidarity , national security , and social stability , as practical deeds for preserving social and political stability .  
Using network resources and conducting research on the question of launching a people 's war on the net are of strong practical significance in making good preparations for military struggle .  In addition , they are also of profound and far-reaching historical significance in developing the strategic ideology of launching people 's war .  
The 80 years of practical experience since the founding of our Party have fully demonstrated that our Party will win the heartfelt embrace and support from the people and will win over this source of inexhaustible power as long as our Party consistently adheres to taking the people 's interests as the starting point of everything and formulate its lines , strategies and policies that comply with the demand for developing advanced productive forces , the advancing direction of progressive culture and the fundamental interests of the majority of the people .  
We need both an overall objective for the entire military and focused practical missions for all military branches and theater troops , confirming different separate goals , remembering not to blindly push for expediency , or go into grandiose projects .  
Around the two historic questions of how to " fight and win " and how one does " not become degenerate , " we now should emancipate our minds , seek truth from facts , smash the trammels of outmoded ideas and the old way of thinking , earnestly study new situations and problems , and explore new ideas , new methods , and new ways to solve major practical problems in the armed forces in order to keep raising the level of army building .  
Now , the battalion has built 12 modern teaching sites with coordinated equipment , such as electronic classrooms , rooms for simulation of animated images , and rooms for simulation of traffic rules .  In addition , it has incorporated use of three-dimensional animated pictures in teaching of basic theories , use of multi-media in explaining the technological structures , and use of simulation in practical application and operation .  As a result , the effectiveness of basic training of trainee soldiers has been improved by three times .  
Doing a conscientious job of economic protection is of major practical significance and far-reaching strategic significance with regard to improving the overall defensive capabilities of cities , avoiding or reducing economic losses during wartime , preserving combat potential , and prevailing in war , as well as with regard to having a stable economy during peacetime , developing production , ensuring supply and demand , and safeguarding a stable and unified political situation .  
Cultivating military cadres with the assistance of civilian colleges and universities is an inevitable choice made to adapt to the world 's military development trends , to the " Two fundamental changes " in our military construction and to the needs for " winning wars " in the future .  It is a practical step in carrying out and implementing the essence of Chairman Jiang 's directives .  
Among these innovations , the solar-energy chargers for three kinds of practical storage batteries that are easy to carry , can be carried in vehicles and are movable were developed by the military transportation and traffic section that took the lead in the whole army in using solar energy batteries to replace the charge of batteries with electricity .  They were developed in line with the characteristics that they are used for air force vehicles and for supporting purpose .  The development has resolved the major difficulties in providing support for air force vehicles for many years .  
Since the 1960s and 1970s , many countries and regions of Asia have taken a practical approach , implementing development strategies of catching up and surpassing , rising quickly from the post-war ruins , achieving sustained and rapid economic growth , greatly improving the standard of living of the people , and writing a new chapter in the promotion of world economic development .  
In the face of air threat under the modern high-tech conditions , the most practical issues lying before the air defense forces in making sound preparations for the military struggle are to create a new theory of operation , new contents of training , new methods of training , and a new ground antiaircraft operational command system by centering on " winning " the future war with anti-air raid as its main aspect so as to meet the needs of future anti-air raid operations .  
closely center our efforts around the need to enhance our ability of " winning the war " ; conscientiously summarize the practical experiences of the troops ; and strive to create flexible and diversified methods of operation , intensive and highly efficient methods of training , and scientific and standardized methods of management .  
The Asian financial crisis has given us a practical lesson .  Financial security is no longer a pure economic issue .  It has a bearing on the political and social security of a country and is part and parcel of national security .  
In his important speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin enunciated a series of fundamental theoretical and practical issues that have a bearing on the overall situation , gave a new summary to the status of ideological and political work in the overall tasks of the party and the state , and also set forth new requirements .  
To implement the policy of managing the party strictly , the most fundamental measure is to draw up a set of practical and binding rules and mechanisms to strengthen ideological and institutional construction at the same time , to give full scope to the role of party committees being the leading cores , the role of party branches being the fighting fortresses , and the role of party members being vanguards and models .  
Meanwhile , we should ensure that military talented personnel have a general understanding of literature , history , philosophy , economy , mathematics , science , engineering , chemistry , biology , and other aspects of knowledge .  With such a background as well as with hard work in practical fields , these people can be all-round persons who can comprehensively utilize various fields of modern knowledge and are equipped with command , professional , and other skills all at the same time .  
At the central conference on ideological and political work , Chairman Jiang clearly pointed out : " On the basis of inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions , we must strive to innovate in and improve the contents , forms , methods , means , mechanisms , and other aspects of our ideological and political work ; we must especially increase the purposefulness and practical results of this work and enhance our initiative in this regard .  
At the same time , he also pointed out a number of problems that were currently existing in the province 's press and propaganda work .  For example , the time effectiveness of the press work still remains poor , news coverage lacks a required depth , the contents of news reports tend to be identical , some newspapers have showed vulgar tastes , and a handful of publications have even failed to keep to a correct opinion orientation .  All these need to be overcome with hard efforts in the practical work in the future .  
During the course of scientific and technological military training , more and more commanders and fighters are seeking truth and practical results , emphasizing applicability , wholeness , and actual combat application , and improving their real ability of winning in future high-tech war .  
The efforts to seek truth and practical results have made each and every flower of reform in the scientific and technological military training bear the fruit of enhancing the troops ' ability of " winning in war " .  Some difficult questions concerning fighting under high-tech conditions have been effectively solved .  
In the drill , on one hand , this department attached prime importance to theoretical study , scientifically analyzed and evaluated the present situation of the theater 's support capacity , especially its own units , and comprehensively grasped the characteristics of the theater 's topography , weather , social situation , popular feelings , and the actual conditions of the equipment and combat readiness , and provided guidance for troops ' practical work .  
The " opinion " also proposes explicit requirements on solutions to many realistic problems in ideological and political construction throughout military academies and universities .  These five documents were formulated in accordance with the " Opinion " on the basis of extensive investigation and study , sufficient solicitation of opinions from every field and repeated study and proof .  They are targeted and practical .  
All the achievements in military theory research presented this time deal with major practical questions concerning preparation for military struggle and furthering of scientific and technological military training , with focus on key and difficult questions concerning combined-arms joint operations , air assault and air defense .  They are the result of thorough exploration of the characteristics and law of fighting and scientific and technological military training under the high-tech conditions .  They serve specific purposes , and they are highly directive and feasible , reflecting the latest achievements made by the PLA in military theory research .  
B : The new challenges and new opportunities require us to have the correct , proper new ideas that go with the flow but also are realistic and practical for us .  Our economic construction should never again embark on a developmental path of extensive expansion .  We should no longer pursue rapid growth only in terms of the total economic volume .  
the legal system of market economy is still unsound , the phenomenon of corruption is spread wide , and there are plenty of ecological environmental problems and so on .  All these are pressing practical issues with an impact on our country 's national economic and social development , which must be tackled through market-oriented reforms .  
At the same time , in innovating training methods and means , it is necessary to adhere to a scientific truth-seeking attitude , prevent and overcome the unrealistic practice of going in for grandiose projects and things foreign , the practice of seeking novelty and surprise without paying attention to practical results , and the practice of being overanxious for quick results , a practice that runs counter to laws .  
The second generation of the Party leadership with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at its core as well as the third generation of the Party leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin at its core restored , upheld and advanced the ideological line of " emancipate one 's thinking , be practical and realistic " , and led the entire party and the entire Chinese people in concentrating efforts on reforms and opening to the outside world , such that China has been seeing miraculous economic and social growth .  
The resolution of key and difficult problems certainly does not lie in shouting slogans more loudly .  It lies in starting out with a recognition of reality , revolving around real problems of widespread concern to the broad masses of officers and soldiers , thinking of practical moves , taking real action , and working steadily and surely to solve the problems .  
The spirit of struggling hard and obtaining practical results demands that we carry forward the fine spirit of the party , build up our country through hard work and frugality , be industrious and thrifty in managing all undertakings and vigorously carry forward the fine work style of speaking the plain truth , seeking practical results and trying our best to fulfill our responsibility .  The spirit of not hankering after fame and fortune and tendering selfless devotion has demanded that we always think of the people and the party 's cause .  
We must hold aloft the banner of ethnic solidarity and progress , vigorously propagate the party 's ethnic and religious policies , and do more practical and good things for the minority-nationality masses , to consolidate the excellent situation of people of all nationalities breathing the same air , sharing the same destiny , and being linked heart to heart .  
In his speech , Yu Yongbo pointed out : The current education drive is an important move and practical step taken on the basis of positive education in " three stresses " carried out in party committees at the regimental level and grassroots units of the armed forces to further study and implement Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of " three represents " , improve the quality of the ranks of party members , and strengthen party building in the armed forces .  
To be more specific , the ideology of an all-embracing government takes the goal conception of equalitarianism as the basis of social integration , whereas in the case of post-omnipotenism with Chinese characteristics , political integration is primarily founded on the authority of the state apparatus and the system , yet the utopian " political myth " embodied in a dogmatic ideology has already been abandoned , and efforts have been made to try to gain the people 's recognition of state power with " practical economic results . "  
To be more specific , the interaction between these diverse values and theories - - liberalists ' pursuit of democracy , personal freedom and enlightenment ; neo-conservatives ' affirmation of the need for political order and stability in the course of modernization and development ; and the New Left 's concern for the interests of the disadvantaged at the grassroots - - plays a positive practical role in safeguarding the sound and rational development of a society and in bringing about a more balanced society through checks and balances .  
During the period of the 10th Five-Year Plan , we should work closely around the goal of expanding domestic demand and adopt practical and effective macroeconomic fiscal policy and monetary policy to stimulate domestic market demand for investment and consumption in order to promote economic growth and upgrade the industrial structure .  
In short , our theoretical work must be closely combined with the realities , take the major practical issues in reform , opening up , and modernization as the main direction of attack in our study , positively probe into the law governing economic , political , and cultural development in building socialism with Chinese characteristics , serve the party and government in making scientific policy decisions , and serve the entire party and nation in working for the interest of the whole .  
Zhang Ming , commander of this unit , said when interviewed by our reporter : " We feel very proud of Wang Wei , this fine comrade-in-arms ; Wang Wei is the hero in our mind and the model for us to emulate ; we will turn righteous anger into strength , faithfully carry out our duties , study assiduously , train hard in the skills for killing the enemy , show no fear in the face of strong enemies , and defend the motherland 's dignity and territorial integrity with practical action . "  
The responsibility of the incident completely lies on the US side .  The Chinese Government filed a protest and made solemn representations to the US Government over the US act violating international law , encroaching on China 's airspace and sovereignty , and compromising China 's national security and interests , demanding that the United States undertake full responsibility for the incident , apologize to the Chinese people , and take practical and effective measures to prevent a recurrence of similar incidents .  
On the basis of doing a good job in the existing projects , the two countries should carry out bilateral cooperation in the development of information industry , bioengineering , pharmaceuticals , and new materials , and accelerate the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into practical productive forces to better serve the economic construction of respective countries .  
After the news of the US Government 's apology to our nation for the " plane collision incident " was announced , cadres and the masses everywhere believe that this is an interim accomplishment in our government 's and people 's reasonable , beneficial , and restrained struggle against US hegemony .  The people have expressed firm support for the correct decisions adopted by our government regarding this incident and have strenuously requested that the United States immediately stop conducting surveillance activities along our coast and take practical measures to prevent this kind of incident from happening again .  
It has not only failed to make progress in formulating policies or in implementing practical measures for enhancing cross-strait political mutual trust .  On the contrary , it has regressed in this regard .  In particular , let us take as examples some recent events including the " Chin Mei-ling incident , " the " incident of Yoshinori Kobayashi 's entry to Taiwan , " and the " incident where Japan revised a textbook on historic facts on Japan 's invasion into China . "  
Under a huge banner with a slogan , " Emulate Wang Wei 's spirit and toughen the strong amphibious contingent , " officers and men of the " hard bone sixth company " carried out the most practical and lively education in fostering lofty ideals and conviction .  
Second , new progress was made in the work of training and educating young cadres .  Through theoretical training , practical exercise , and routine education and management , the ideological and political quality of the young cadres was enhanced , and their ability to do organizational work and exercise leadership was also enhanced .  
We should target the characteristic that most logistical science and technology have military and civilian applications as we vigorously bring in local advanced and practical scientific and technological results , put civilian work to military use and promptly turn them into a military economic benefit , so that they can provide a service and boost our safeguard capability .  We should pay attention to using society 's R &amp; D capability to accelerate the strong pace of using scientific and technological advancement to achieve security .  
All localities , in the light of local situations , should clearly set the objectives , focus on key tasks , and strive to achieve practical results .  We should not only decidedly wipe out criminal forces and pressure groups already uncovered , but also should expose criminal forces and pressure groups that have been lying low and have not been exposed and clamp down on them .  
Article 4 .  National defense education shall be based on the principle of participation by the whole people , long-term perseverance , and seeking practical results ; the principle of combining regular education with concentrated education , universal education with focused education , and theoretical education with behavioral education should be pursued ; and its implementation should be organized by category , with the contents of education determined according to different recipients of education .  
Putin emphasized : President Jiang Zemin 's visit to Russia is a major event in Russian-Chinese relations this year ; and it has extremely important practical and historical significance .  I am very delighted to be able to have a thorough exchange of views with President Jiang on ways to continuously enrich and deepen the strategic cooperative partnership between the two countries , and to promote and strengthen bilateral cooperation in world affairs in the coming century .  
They must vigorously carry forward the spirit of ceaselessly striving to achieve socialist modernization , emancipate their minds , seek truth from facts , keep abreast of the times , be bold in innovation , and forge ahead irrespective of the difficulties ; they should press forward with indomitable will , work hard , seek practical results , refrain from seeking fame and wealth , dedicate themselves in selfless fashion , take firm footing in their work posts , love their work , whatever it is , and study and become proficient in it .  
Instead , they should raise questions based on their local conditions and solve the questions in a way suited to their local conditions .  On the one hand , they should not act too fast .  Rather , they should focus on one or two striking questions in practical work as a starting point , press ahead step by step , and develop their work in the course of progress .  
The key to studying for the purpose of application lies in guiding the broad ranks of cadres to combine theoretical study with the study of practical issues and conscientiously enhance their abilities to analyze and solve practical issues using scientific theory in close connection with the new changes in the international situation , the new advances in China 's drive of reform and opening up to the outside world and socialism modernization as well , and the new developments and new problems facing our party building .  
We must persist in focusing our vision on enhancing the overall qualities of the rural grassroots cadres , on resolving current conspicuous problems in the rural areas , and on safeguarding and developing the interests of the peasants ; in particular , we should do a number of practical things centering on rural economic development , to improve rural production and living conditions and make efforts to increase peasant incomes .  
Huang Qingyi said : Xu Rongkai has worked in both local and central departments and committees , including organs of the State Council . He is familiar with the work of macroeconomic management and social development and has rather rich practical experience in these fields .  He has a good knowledge of theories and policies , strong writing skills , and remarkable organizing and coordinating ability .  
Wang Zhaoguo stressed : Recently Comrade Jiang Zemin emphasized the need to adhere to the four cardinal principles .  For us , this is a practical and effective guidance , which will enable us to keep a sober political mind , uphold the correct political orientation of the united front work , enhance our ideal and confidence in the party and achieve still greater success in doing the united front work .  
Through the previous period of study , the majority of Party members in the military have obtained a certain level of awareness and understanding of the rich content and political , theoretical and practical meaning of the important thinking of the " three represents " .  However , this important thinking is broad , extensive and profound , with very rich content .  
We should , in accordance with the characteristics of this educational campaign , satisfactorily conduct programs to study , supervise and discuss crucial and specific issues and topics , understand Chairman Jiang 's important thinking of the " three represents " in association with the Marxist theory on Party-building , consider this thinking in accordance with the positive and negative experiences of the CPC and parties of foreign countries , and study this thinking in association with replying and solving the significant theoretical and practical issues we are facing at present .  
On the basis of meticulously reviewing the positive and negative experiences , recollecting its courage and confidence and correcting its mistakes , the party established and adhered to the ideological line of seeking the truth from facts , gradually understood the practical situation of China , created a road of " circling cities with rural areas and taking over political power through arms " ? which suited the Chinese practical situation and won the victory of a modern national democratic revolution .  
He further hoped that the quality education base for youths and the science and technology hall will extend the quality education of schools and allow every middle and elementary school student to be trained and nurtured in creative thinking , willpower and moral character , physical health , environmental protection sense , and capability in practical living .  
The ministers unanimously held that it is necessary to further strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation , push forward the process of trade and investment liberalization and facilitation within APEC , and step up economic and technical cooperation in order to meet challenges of the new century with practical action .  
All localities and departments should conscientiously implement the spirit of the central instructions , take practical and effective measures to guarantee water supply for cities and drinking water for people and livestock in rural areas and , through structural adjustments and major efforts to save on water , strive to do a good job in industrial and agricultural production .  
This important directive fully demonstrates that firmly establishing the viewpoint of the masses , adhering to the line of the masses and solving practical problems faced by the masses are crucial to strengthening and improving party-building .  This directive explicitly points out the direction for our current educational campaign to study and practice the important thinking of the " three represents " and maintain the advanced nature of party members .  
When practical problems faced by the masses are solved , their ideological problems will be solved immediately .  The majority of officers and soldiers will have a stronger conviction in firmly trusting the party , loving the party and being firm in following the party .  In this way , our planned objective of promoting the educational campaign to study and practice the important thinking of the " three represents " and maintain the advanced nature of party members will be realized .  
It is necessary to meet the requirements in the development of the times and the modernization drive , set aright the guiding ideas for education , change the education concepts , orient education to the cultivation of students ' innovative spirit of practical capability , enable students to master the basic knowledge , basic skills , and methods for their lifetime studies , and develop their physical and mental health in their growth .  
Nearly 20-million rural cadres and grass-roots cadres in China have mastered one practical technology or two , and among them , 3-million people won primary professional technical titles and 500,000 people won secondary professional technical titles . 
The " Shanghai Spirit " , which has been developed during the process of the " Shanghai Five " , shows the characteristics of mutual trust and benefit , equality , consultation , mutual respect to different civilizations , and common prosperity .  The spirit is not only the summary of the experiences the five states have gained in handling relations with others , but is also of practical significance in pushing forward a just and rational new order of international politics and economy .  
The " Shanghai spirit " cultivated by the Shanghai Five process of mutual trust , mutual benefit , equality , consultation , respect for cultural pluralism , and seeking common development , is a summary of the experiences of the five countries in handling mutual relations ; in addition , it is of important practical significance in promoting the establishment of a new international political and economic order of justice and reason .  
All military forces closely united this educational campaign with the practical struggle and the reality of the thinking of officers and soldiers and distinguishing the right and wrong regarding crucial and major issues .  
Liu Yunshan said : In various historical periods in which the CPC leads revolution , construction and reform , its propaganda and ideological work plays a very important role in disseminating the scientific truth , promoting the integration of Marxism with the practical reality in China , uniting with , mobilizing and rallying the masses , fulfilling historical tasks in various periods , advocating advanced moral practice and scientific and civilized way of life , and improving the ideological , moral , scientific and cultural quality of the whole nation .  
The two major theoretical results are the crystallization of the practical experience and collective wisdom of the party and the people , the valuable spiritual wealth of our party , and the great banner that guides us to advance triumphantly .  
The key to upholding Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought in the new historical period lies in persistent use of Deng Xiaoping Theory to observe the present-day world and contemporary China , incessantly sum up practical experience and generalize it in the new theoretical light and open up new ways forward .  
To remain keen in mastering the development trend and requirements of China 's productive forces and take practical steps to promote the constant development of advanced productive forces by making economic development the central task and formulating and implementing a correct line , principles , and policies are the fundamental manifestations and requirements for our party to stand in the forefront of the times and maintain its advanced nature .  
When fathers of Marxism hold such an open and dynamic attitude towards their classical works , why do we have to be dogmatic , worship books and be restrained to some expositions and specific practical programs they proposed in specific historical conditions and concrete situations ?  
In his " 1 July " speech , Comrade Jiang Zemin gave a penetrating exposition on the important concept of " three represents " and put forward new ideas and views on a number of major theoretical and practical issues concerning party building and the socialist modernization drive , thereby pointing out the direction for advancing the cause of the party and the country in the coming century .  
It comprehensively summed up the glorious course and basic experiences of the party , systematically expounded the important concept of " three represents , " explicitly set the basic requirements of strengthening and improving party building , and profoundly answered major theoretical and practical questions of fundamental importance with a bearing on the overall situation , about which people had been concerned .  
For this reason , the United States began to reconsider China 's strength and ponder if its excessively radical policy to contain and isolate China had damaged US strategic interests and practical economic interests .  It is against this background that US Secretary of State Powell plans to visit Beijing in July and Bush is scheduled to visit China and meet with President Jiang Zemin in October , in a hope to establish constructive relations with China .  
We , cadres at the basic level in rural areas , should strengthen our self-cultivation , grasp more knowledge of agricultural science and technology , really " represent the progressive course of the advanced culture " in our villages , and strive to do more practical work for the common people .  
To improve the party 's leadership and party building , we must first proceed from these two major transformations to earnestly study theoretical and practical issues facing party building under the new historical conditions and study the laws governing the rule of the country by the Communist Party , socialist construction , and the development of human society that underlie these issues so as to better advance party building .  
To study and resolve major party building issues in the spirit of reform , we would have to - - in accordance with practical criteria , particularly the criteria of the " three represents " - - test and examine the various aspects of the party 's ideological , political , organizational , and workstyle development to see whether they meet the requirements of the " three represents " and are proved through practice to be correct and effective .  
and go down to the basic level and enterprises more frequently to immerse ourselves among the vast numbers of masses in agricultural and pastoral areas , indicated Legqog . Through conducting thoroughgoing and practical investigations and studies , we will be able to have a definite object in view when guiding the region 's economic work , fulfill all our tasks in a more thoroughgoing and effective way , and ensure a complete success for our work in all fields .  
Despite Pronk 's proposal not being completely satisfactory , developing countries , keeping in mind the general interests of improving the international ecological environment , finally agreed to accept Pronk 's proposal in order to enable the " Kyoto Protocol " to go into force at an early date and to compel developed countries to take practical and effective measures to reduce greenhouse gases emissions .  
Shi Guangsheng set these requirements : Departments in charge of foreign trade and economic cooperation at various levels should do everything possible to expand exports and take this as the most important task in their work for the second half of the year .  They should take prompt action , do thoroughgoing and practical work , and go down to basic units to help enterprises surmount difficulties and expand exports .  
When constructing new ports , roads , and railways and optic fiber and ground satellite projects , counties and cities in the coastal regions have fully considered the practical needs for coastal defense and incorporated them into unified planning and construction .  This is to ensure coordination in coastal defense management and economic development of coastal regions .  
Up to now , the navies of some middle class countries are equipped with light class carriers , with costs varying from $ 300-500-million , and while this class of carrier can fulfill some regional combat missions , they can not handle the naval formations of strong nations , so this class of carrier would have no practical significance for the Chinese navy .  
He also expressed his thorough approval of the positive work done by Henan Province . Li Zhibin , vice governor of Henan Province , indicated that all levels of Henan Province 's government will adopt practical and effective measures , and will reduce the suffering and losses of the public to the lowest level .  
The " Ordinance " stresses : The development of an automated command system must be organized and carried out according to military needs .  It is necessary to adhere to the thought of integrative development , unify leadership , unify planning , unify the technical structure , effect scientific organization and close cooperation , emphasize practical results , and ensure quality .  
However , due to historical and practical reasons , some backward cultures , and even decadent cultures that corrode people 's mind and endanger the cause of socialism , have emerged in society .  These cultures corrupt social values , weaken the will of people , poison young people 's mind , have caused great harm to society , and have aroused the strong resentment of the masses of people .  We must make great efforts to rectify this situation .  
We should grasp the substance , stress the main points , link theory with practice , seek practical results and , in light of the major ideological and theoretical issues , which have been raised in practical life and which are of concern to the cadres and masses , and , in light of the new , major strategic issues with a bearing on the overall development of the cause of the party and state , conscientiously organize our studies and give scientific answers .  
literature and art work should be concentrated on creating excellent works in larger quantity ; ideological and political work should be concentrated on enhancing understanding , unifying ideas , and improving its pertinence and practical results ; and the building of spiritual civilization should be concentrated on consolidation , enhancement , extension , and radiation and on spreading the experience gained at selected units to , and promote , the entire area .  
Guidance should be given to retired cadres as to broadening their horizons , updating their concepts , acquiring a profound understanding of the major theoretical and practical significance of the " speech , " maintaining political staunchness , frequently renewing their thinking , keeping up with the times , and always preserving the nature of CPC members .  
The exposition in the " speech " on the dialectical relationship between the party 's minimum program and maximum program has educated and inspired all party comrades that they should not only cherish lofty ideals but also be earnest and down-to-earth and that they should not only have a long perspective but also be practical and truth-seeking .  
It is of major practical significance and far-reaching historical significance .  Through two decades of reforms and opening up , China 's comprehensive national strength has notably increased and a socialist market economic system has been preliminarily established .  Thus , conditions are ripe for accelerating the development of China 's western regions .  
To the common people of China , perhaps the reform of the budget planning method has no specific links to their everyday life , but in reality , this reform , which stems from the practical demand of intensifying economic and budgetary supervision , can bring major benefits to the broad masses of the people .

IACWGE continues its work to develop practical support for gender mainstreaming . 20 In a number of other areas , as proposed by CCPOQ , it would be important to further fine tune the cross-cutting themes identified at the world conferences , starting from the 12 themes agreed by the Council ( see E / 1995 / 86 ) with a view to identifying more selective and better defined issues that would benefit from a coordinated approach and supportive tools . 
Its membership has been growing day by day and civil society has begun to identify with it as a solid basis for the hope that nuclear disarmament efforts may prove successful in the future if they take the form of firm , practical and effective steps , as reflected in General Assembly resolution 53 / 77 Y .  
Rather than the easy path of headline _ grabbing , seductive , hasty and ultimately utopian disarmament , we have always preferred the more demanding path of serene , practical , well thought _ out and for that very reason realistic disarmament ; that path is the only guarantee of the security of each State , large or small , and for that very reason an assurance of greater security for all .  
Consequently , the Special Rapporteur has already expressed the view that indigenous peoples , although they may constitute numerical minorities in a number of the countries in which they now live , are not minorities in accordance with United Nations usage and for the purposes of possible practical action on the part of the Organization . 24 / By the same token , ethnic and / or national minorities are not to be considered indigenous peoples in the United Nations context . 
Having completed his research , the Special Rapporteur considers that it may be useful to review the above list , so as to determine - at least provisionally - what would be the most practical and fruitful means ( i.e . treaty / agreement renegotiation and / or proper implementation , constructive arrangement , resort to international bodies , or some other formula ) of constructively approaching , in the future , the wide array of current situations confronting those peoples mentioned above .  
Particular consideration should be given , in these cases , to the practical day-to-day consequences ( sometimes grave ) of the lack of such agreements for the juridical and political status of the peoples concerned in the mixed societies in which they now live , and for the preservation , promotion and effective realization of their historical rights as peoples , including their human rights and freedoms .

In view of the apparent lack of international consensus on the principles embodied in the Moon Agreement , as shown by its relatively low level of ratification , it is likely that practical issues relating to the ownership of and equitable access to such resources should will require further substantial consideration and study within the field of international law .  
No single aspect , including FDI , should be treated in isolation but rather as part of an interdependent whole that would equally include practical applications : investment promotion agencies , investment and technological policy reviews , investment guides for LDCs , and negotiation of bilateral or regional investment treaties among developing countries .

As a representative had once said , the work of the Committee was the hardest of all , because it did not consist in merely discussing practical issues , reconciling interests or solving technical problems , but rather in something as basic as deciding what exactly was a society for all and achieving consensus among the different viewpoints of States on a single definition , based on a common concept of humanity . 
The new guidelines , intended for use by statistical compilers , data users and policy officials , will provide methodological standards for the compilation of statistics on external debt based on the international investment position framework and concept ; practical guidance for the compilation of these statistics ; and selected topics on the use of external debt data in the analysis of macroeconomic sustainability and external vulnerability .

Yet practical results have been dismal as regard substantive measures directed toward the eventual and total elimination of nuclear weapons , which constitute the most destructive of such weapons of mass destruction .  
It is sad but true that the sovereignty arguments can be used and sometimes have the practical result of finding excuses for repressive , even murderous Governments which are engaging in gross violations of the human rights of their own citizens .  
Secondly , some elements that were incorporated into the draft resolution are not in accordance with our own perception of nuclear disarmament , which is fully identified with the position of the Non-Aligned Movement as appropriately stated at its summit at Cartagena , Colombia , in an international setting that favoured the promotion of practical measures for the final and complete elimination of nuclear weapons .  
The PRESIDENT : On the second issue , I would like to recall that the representative of South Africa made a proposal at the first plenary meeting on 19 January 1999 to establish an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament to deliberate upon practical steps for systematic and progressive efforts to eliminate nuclear weapons as well as to identify if and when one or more such steps should be subject to negotiations in the Conference .  
The action to be taken by Governments includes a range of practical and systematic measures directed at the full implementation of human rights instruments , the promotion of human rights education , the creation of national institutions for promoting women ' s rights , the promotion of the human rights of indigenous women , and the adoption of strategies for the mainstreaming of gender perspectives through increased and strengthened efforts and cooperation .  
It is no longer acceptable or even practical to divide the international community into two distinct groupings : one living behind the walls of fortresses of alliances and weapons of mass destruction , while the security concerns of others are completely neglected as they are depicted as the source of possible threat and worthy of containment and deprivation . 
Reviewing the achievements of the Committee at the current session , especially the addition of new elements to previous resolutions , he noted that , as far as the resolution on the establishment of an international criminal court was considered , there had been broad agreement on the historic significance of the adoption of the Rome Statute and on the need to embark upon the practical arrangements for the commencement of the functions of the Court .  
UNCTAD ' s technical cooperation activities are an essential complement to its analytical and policy work , providing practical and direct benefits to recipient countries and also serving as a conduit for the assimilation of development experiences at the country and regional levels into more coherent and development-friendly policy approaches at the international level .  
In this connection , Ukraine underlines the importance of a more active and practical participation of the international financial institutions in providing additional financial assistance to the affected economies , and reiterates its earlier proposals to that effect , as contained in its position paper on the problems of implementation of the economic sanctions imposed by the Security Council ( see A 51-226 , annex-S 1996 595 , annex ) .

Economic , social and environmental linkages essential for achieving SHD have been widely acknowledged yet applied methodologies and practical tools to address these linkages are not fully reflected in macroeconomic reform processes and framework setting .  
We also recommend that positive consideration be given to the Secretary-Generals practical and action-oriented recommendations , in particular those that are targeted at enhancing the capacity of national Governments and the international community to prosecute violations of international humanitarian law ; improving engagement by the Security Council and others with a view to obtaining access to vulnerable populations for humanitarian operations ; and developing clear criteria and procedures for the identification and separation of armed elements in situations of massive population displacement .  
The Interlaken process focused on the practical and technical aspects involved in designing effective financial sanctions and ensuring their successful implementation .  
We are convinced that the United Nations should play the central role in facilitating the transformation of Afghanistan into a normal , stable and prosperous state not only because averting the threat to regional and international security emanating from Taliban-controlled territory falls squarely within the purview of the Security Council and the General Assembly , but also because we believe that only within the context of the United Nations can we find practical solutions that would be acceptable to all parties to the peace process , thereby ensuring the parties cooperation in their implementation .

Noting with grave concern that despite the efforts of the international community , the principal objectives of the two previous Decades for Action to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination had not been attained , the General Assembly decided that the World Conference would be action-oriented and focus on practical measures to eradicate racism , including measures of prevention , education and protection and the provision of effective remedies , taking into full consideration the existing human rights instruments .  
He had concluded that that was not necessary either for practical reasons ( it would be extremely difficult , if not impossible , to establish a clear-cut violation of internal law in respect of reservations ) or for technical reasons ( the internal procedure in respect of reservations is often empirical and difficult of access ) ; there , too , the Commissions opinion would be valuable to him . 
It was also stated that continued discussion on highly theoretical issues related to the topic tended to diminish the relative and fragile clarity which had been achieved and , in this connection , the point was made that approaching the topic in more practical terms could be more conducive to making progress on it .  
With regard to the role of international agreements , he pointed out that so far recognition of the importance of technology transfer for developing countries was only formal in nature , expressed solely through the existence of the relevant international and regional arrangements , but that further refinement of those arrangements was needed in order to facilitate the practical possibilities of their actual implementation .
