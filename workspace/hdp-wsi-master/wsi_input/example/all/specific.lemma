Since it was established in 1945 , the United Nations has elaborated a comprehensive body of international human rights standards and put into place a complex system of international supervision of national respect for those standards , which provide the High Commissioner with a solid foundation on which to build his own specific activities .

Another representative also expressed her preference for a permanent body working on a full-time basis , given the nature , complexity and specific activities of the Court as well as the increasing number of cases that might come under its jurisdiction , but nevertheless supported a more flexible solution , bearing in mind the possible economic and practical difficulties involved .  
One representative expressed surprise at the absence of any reference in article 33 to other sources of substantive international law , and suggested that it be redrafted to broaden the range of applicable rules , so that over and above the statute , the Court could apply the draft Code , treaties relating to certain specific crimes , principles and rules of international law , the relevant acts of international organizations and , if necessary , any rule of national law .  
The above notwithstanding , the wording of subparagraph ( c ) providing that the Court should apply " to the extent applicable , any rule of national law " was considered as too vague by some representatives , who called for more specific language bearing in mind that international law did not yet contain a complete statement of substantive and procedural criminal law . 
They also welcomed the fact that the draft articles provided explicit rules under which watercourse States were entitled to enter into bilateral or multilateral agreements , tailored to their specific needs , provided that they respected the general principles set forth in the articles .  
One representative expressed the view that , from the standpoint of terminology , it would be advisable to highlight the difference between contiguous or adjacent and successive watercourses , as each system had its own specific features , and that a particular rule could not be assumed to be applicable to both types of watercourses .

The comprehensive agreement is the only agreement that has been in full force and subject to specific verification for almost a year now , yet the current status of compliance with it - the practical expression of which would be a marked improvement in respect for human rights in Guatemala - stands in stark contrast to and falls far short of what was agreed .  
The Commission may wish to address appropriate measures to increasing financing for priority actions at the national level related to science for sustainable development , in particular scientific capacity-building in developing countries , and to formulate recommendations addressed to multilateral and bilateral donor agencies and Governments , as well as specific funding mechanisms , such as the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) .

In countries like Norway and the Netherlands , among others , Governments also conduct direct negotiations with major stakeholders so that voluntary agreements could be concluded between parties concerned to meet specific environmental targets .  
Decisions regarding the relevance of the proposals in the blueprint and responsibility for taking specific actions would rest with each country , organization or other entity , as appropriate , taking into account the diversity of economic , social , cultural and political conditions , while respecting duly approved international instruments and standards in the field of human rights .

The instrument may be designed and established at the national level , specific emission levels set by local authorities , with monitoring and money collecting conducted by regional inspectorates .  
The review of the use of economic instruments in developed countries , countries with economies in transition and developing countries demonstrated clearly that depending on their specific conditions , they had in varying degrees attempted to achieve a less distortionary tax system by introducing environmental taxes .

Universal : while respectful of the diversity of conditions and perspectives that exist in the world , the follow-up should try to achieve a proper balance between the monitoring of universal commitments and forms of solidarity , on the one hand , and the continuous learning derived from the exchange of experience and from debates on specific policies adopted by individual Governments and other actors on the social scene , on the other ;

It is currently coordinating with the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) in the design of profiles for poverty alleviation policies in four specific sectors in Lebanon - namely , health , education , employment and fiscal policy .  With regard to the theme of social integration , ESCWA has established the first Arab regional computer training centre for blind women / girls , located in Amman , Jordan .  
Although it may be difficult to present these situations in terms of precise and measurable indicators , it is suggested that both qualitative and quantitative indicators are important in relation to indicators of violence against women migrant workers and that specific indicators for the following can be developed in due course .  
The figures provided by the Government are thus unclear on the specific issue raised by the Security Council in its presidential statement of 23 February 1996 , namely , the issue of prosecutions against those suspected of past violations of international humanitarian law and human rights against the local Serb minority . 
The Counsel for Human Rights , with support from the Mission , has elaborated a work plan for his programme on behalf of indigenous peoples which seeks to : ( a ) put an end to discriminatory practices against indigenous peoples and individuals ; ( b ) guarantee the practical enjoyment and exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms ; and ( c ) promote respect for and recognition and promotion of the historical and specific rights of indigenous peoples .  
This applies to female employees as well , and legislation is in force preventing discrimination against women based on maternal duties , stipulating that the duration of creditable service time must include the time spent in child care , equivalent in length to maternity leave or extended maternity leave ( as specified by relevant legislation ) , as well as time spent in all-day care for a child with severely impaired health , as regulated by specific legislation ( maximum six years of the sum of such creditable times ) .  
As to the specific proposal raised by Malta ( see A / 50 / 142 ) , the question of how the United Nations machinery for dealing with international environmental issues should be developed is a very important substantive issue that needs to be addressed in the first instance by the policy machinery that the General Assembly has set up to consider coordination of environmental and development issues - the Commission on Sustainable Development .  
UNDP has supported a Central American initiative to establish a Central American Network for Democratic Governance , which would act as an internal regional mechanism for dialogue and concerted action and would also help to identify weaknesses in the functioning of the Government which might be responsive to specific training activities ;  
The preparation of such a diagnostic framework would enable each country to undertake its own analysis of the conditions specific to it ; it would allow a wide range of national factors to be taken into account , particularly the interaction of different sectoral policies , and a nation 's international obligations ; and it would draw attention , where appropriate , to those circumstances in which global or external influences were important as driving forces of change . 
This reflects varying economic , environmental , social , cultural and religious values and needs , which operate within legal and policy frameworks usually specific to individual countries .  
It further implies that individual countries review and test the practical possibilities to measure and periodically assess specific indicators at the field level and that they assess their relevance to prevailing environmental , economic , social and institutional realities of the country concerned .  
The implications of the need to consider specific , national characteristics in the implementation of internationally agreed criteria and indicators are still to be clarified , especially as regards coordinated international action , comparability between countries and potential convergence , and possibilities of continuing to maintain trust and mutual acceptance among countries , international initiatives , and different interest groups .  
While there appears to be general agreement on sustainability criteria , it has become increasingly clear that indicators , through which progress is monitored over time , must be tailored to meet specified economic , environmental , social and cultural conditions , operating within institutional , legal and policy frameworks specific to individual countries .  
Analytical work and operational modalities for integrating the economies in transition into the regional economic mainstream have been clustered around three groups of activities : ( i ) provision of advisory , research and information services , ( ii ) the convening of intergovernmental and expert group meetings , workshops and seminars on various economic and social development issues , and ( iii ) provision of training in accordance with specific requests from the Governments concerned .  
This can be accomplished by educating capital markets about the investment opportunities in SFM ; by packaging and structuring these opportunities in ways that are easily understood and recognizable to private sector investors ; and by reducing risks and incremental costs specific to an emerging industry .  
While the global Secretariat relies on its existing staff to carry out its established work programme and implement the various mandates entrusted to it , it does occasionally experience the need for supplementing established staffing resources on a short-term basis to respond to specific mandates or requests from Member States , or to meet the demands of peak periods in areas subject to sharp and often unpredictable workload fluctuations .  
The pool of non-retirees , particularly for specific language combinations and / or functions , is limited for two reasons : first , the Organization must ensure that the freelancers it recruits meet the same high standards required of established language staff ; and , second , the United Nations must compete on the freelance market with other organizations both within and outside the common system who in some cases can be more stable or financially advantageous sources of employment .  
It was also suggested to include in the statute such specific grounds for the excusing and disqualification of judges as : that the judge is the injured party or a relative of the accused or of the injured party , or a national of a complainant State or of a State of which the accused is a national , or that the judge has acted as a witness , representative , counsel , public prosecutor or judge at the national level in the case involving the accused .  
By resolution 665 ( 1990 ) , the Security Council authorized the use of such measures commensurate to the specific circumstances as may be necessary to halt all inward and outward maritime shipping in order to inspect and verify their cargoes and destinations and to ensure strict implementation of the provisions related to such shipping laid down in resolution 661 ( 1990 ) .  
Although no substantive intergovernmental or inter-agency discussion on the subject has yet taken place , the recent conceptual analyses and specific case studies have featured several basic principles or criteria for identifying and assessing the special economic problems of States arising from the implementation by them of sanctions imposed under Chapter VII of the Charter .  
The shortage of poliomyelitis vaccine , which continues to worsen , has impeded the implementation of periodic or annual therapeutic , preventive and awareness-raising programmes connected with national and international immunization campaigns with specific timetables .  Many Libyan and other children have thus been prevented from receiving doses at the prescribed times in accordance with the guidelines of the World Health Organization ( WHO ) and national public health laws and regulations .  
It will also draw up specific programmes as follow-up to the decisions taken in Agenda 21 and the Commission on Sustainable Development regarding the provision of adequate and predictable new and additional financial resources to developing countries , and mechanisms for the transfer of technology to those countries , including on concessional and preferential terms , as mutually agreed in paragraph 34.14 ( b ) of Agenda 21 " .  
Although it may be difficult to present these situations in terms of precise and measurable indicators , it is suggested that both qualitative and quantitative indicators are important in relation to indicators of violence against women migrant workers and that specific indicators for the following can be developed in due course .  
Pledging to carry out practical reforms , consistent with the specific situation in each country , they aimed to achieve a high level of employment and widely shared prosperity , and reforms of the tax and social system to ensure that " work pays " , particularly for the least well-off ; lowering social security charges , which place a burden on low-skilled jobs , in countries with high indirect labour costs ; and improving public employment agencies ;  
The objectives of the AEQM Plan are to analyse the specific impact of productive activity on all environmental systems in a given geographical space ; to assess the assimilative capacity of those systems ; and based on these two technical assessments , to establish a set of environmental priorities and action plans to improve environmental quality and reduce the adverse environmental impact on air , water and land resources .  
They include financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal liability of the member of the force . 
In any case , the Special Rapporteur has raised questions and issues which need to be resolved in the light of improved knowledge of the facts and specific reports and following a systematic analysis that will produce suggestions and proposals for the adoption of political , legal and operational criteria concerning mercenary activities .  
The Committee considered that the mandate received from the General Assembly did not require an opinion on bilateral issues between member States , which is why it makes no statement on the specific measures adopted by the Government of the United States of America in relation to Cuba , such as the embargo imposed for over three decades , while nevertheless noting that such measures raise legal questions in the light of the norms established in articles 18 and 19 of the charter of the Organization of American States ;  
In many countries , although scarcity is less of a problem at the national level , overuse of groundwater , contributing to waterlogging and salinity , has become a major problem in specific regions , such as northern China , western and southern India and parts of Mexico . 
Regarding organized crime , a number of specific measures had been taken that responded to part II of Congress resolution 1 , 1 / dealing with action against transnational and organized crime , particularly at the regional level , by updating domestic legislation in the area of money laundering , extradition and mutual assistance ; establishing separate units to deal with organized crime and improving legislation on environmental protection .  
While the Bureau agreed that the rules of procedure needed to be fully respected and that specific decisions on the participation of major groups in the session would be taken by the General Assembly , it also agreed that a number of activities could be organized during the special session with a view to ensuring effective input of major groups and their active inter-action with government representatives .  
It was essential to ensure full compliance with the reporting requirements contained in the Charter of the United Nations ; direct input , through the voice of petitioners , from the peoples of the Territories ; the annual multilateral review of all material presented ; consideration of the situation in the Territories directly in the Special Committee ; and reflection in appropriate decisions of the General Assembly upon the advice of the Special Committee of specific avenues for United Nations input ( such as visiting missions , electoral assistance or coordination of any kind ) .  
The Child Protection Code , promulgated by an Act signed in November 1995 , provides specific follow-up to that general policy , with a view to securing the necessary balance between the imperatives of social prevention and the necessities of legal protection , thereby rendering intervention by the various social , educational and legal parties and structures involved in the protection of children effective .  
These programmes have been accompanied by specific measures of equal importance dealing with social security , including in particular the reform of the industrial accident and occupational disease scheme , which has produced substantial improvements both in the extent of the cover and benefits , especially those paid to widows and orphans , and in the improvements made in the social security system in the agricultural sector . 
In paragraphs 38 to 44 of his report , the Secretary-General discusses several means of limiting the liability of the Organization , such as financial and temporal limitation , counter-claims and off-sets , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal responsibility on the part of a member of the force .  
The High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights has continued actively to seek support and engaging in a dialogue within the framework of the Decade with several international non-governmental organizations , centres and associations that organize ( often through their networks of national chapters ) international programmes for human rights education addressed to specific targets or with a regional or thematic focus .  
It is suggested that the focal points ' tasks should be to identify national human rights education needs and to develop a national plan of action for human rights education containing specific objectives , strategies and programmes for the enhancement of human rights education at all levels , including pre-schools , primary and secondary schools , higher education , professional schools , training programmes for public officials and non-formal learning , including general public information .  
Like many developing countries , it was disappointed by the shortage of financial resources and by the developed countries ' failure to contribute , in clear and specific terms , the new and additional financial resources required for the successful implementation of Agenda 21 .  
The United Nations should emphasize the formulation of policies aimed at fostering a consensus on development strategy as a vital step towards the building of a new global partnership , and should develop specific programmes to assist the least developed countries - most of which had yet to benefit from increased flows of private capital - and the African countries , which were suffering from a heavy debt burden and a lack of basic infrastructure for development .  
The High Commissioner / Centre maintained a close working relation with the Conference secretariat by sharing its expertise and providing background materials as well as contributions in the area of human rights and on the specific issues of forced displacement , with a view to ensuring that commitments undertaken under international human rights and humanitarian law standards were accurately reflected in the final document of the Conference . 
Other activities also continue to receive considerable attention , such as assistance on specific human rights issues , including the implementation of comprehensive national plans of action for the promotion and protection of human rights , popular participation in decision-making and implementation of projects relating to economic , social and cultural rights , including the right to development .  
In Haiti , although there is no direct technical cooperation related to a specific project , close and regular coordination is maintained at a political level .  
In order to better review the promotion and practical realization of the Declaration , the Working Group decided to collect information on the constitutions and legislation of States in respect of the protection and promotion of the rights of minorities , and to commission the preparation of short studies on the content and scope of the core principles contained in the Declaration , including the formulation of specific and concrete recommendations for their application in different countries and regions of the world .  
In a number of cases , Special Rapporteurs , appointed by United Nations human rights organs to investigate human rights situations in specific regions and countries , and on thematic issues , have addressed the rights of persons belonging to national or ethnic , religious and linguistic minorities within their mandates or have been confronted with violations of the rights of persons belonging to minorities .  
The objectives of the Independent Bureau have remained the same as those pursued by the Independent Commission , i.e . , to study specific humanitarian issues that have been inadequately dealt with to date or that call for solutions in line with new realities ; to identify opportunities for more effective action by the international community and to make practical , action-oriented proposals to that end ; to enhance public awareness of the conditions that create and perpetuate human suffering ; and to strengthen efforts at governmental and non-governmental level to bring about appropriate changes and adjustments . 
As indicated in paragraph 18 , the analysis had identified several specific functions that could be centralized in theatre , including the communications master network centre ; the wide area network hub for providing access to electronic mail ; the operation of fixed-wing aircraft and services to aircraft of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia , Baranja and Western Sirmium ( UNTAES ) and the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina ( UNMIBH ) flying to and from Zagreb as required ;  
On the question of limitations of liability ( para . 38 ) , given the substantial increase in the number and amount of third-party claims against the United Nations , the General Assembly might wish to consider , inter alia , financial and temporal limitations , counter-claims and set-offs , and recovery from the States contributing contingents in specific cases of gross negligence , wilful misconduct or international criminal liability of the member of the force .  
It was not easy to conclude from the report of the Secretary-General on human resources management ( A / C . 5 / 51 / 1 ) whether the Office of Human Resources Management ( OHRM ) had developed the specific guidelines required to translate the universal rules established by the General Assembly for use by programme managers and whether any monitoring mechanism had been put in place to ensure proper implementation at the departmental level of the relevant General Assembly decisions and resolutions .  
The four main areas identified by the Committee at its first general discussion , namely the adequacy of international standards , the prevention of the involvement of children in armed conflicts , their effective protection , as well as their physical and psychological recovery and social reintegration were addressed in the study , and were the subject of specific recommendations by Ms . Machel .  
Calls upon the international community to apply , where necessary , the principle of common but differentiated responsibility in ongoing international cooperation on the protection of the environment and in efforts to implement existing instruments of international environmental law and the elaboration of new instruments , and to continue to take fully into account specific circumstances and requirements , in particular , those of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , thus facilitating their compliance with their obligations under international agreements ;  
Faced with the related phenomena of a large informal sector and a missing middle in their enterprise structure , LDCs need to take specific measures , in the context of their enterprise development strategies , targeted at helping their micro and small enterprises to grow and drawing them into the formal sector , through the development of an infrastructural and human resource base , the strengthening of their technological capabilities , and the provision of finance , training and other business support services .  
Such work may also require international support for related activities at the national level , including technical cooperation activities to strengthen national policy and institutional instruments , and the domestic capabilities needed for this purpose , in the specific areas concerned . 
Each national legislation established its own rules concerning natural persons , with the sole obligation of observing international custom and generally recognized legal principles , particularly the 1993 Hague Convention concerning specific questions relating to conflicts of laws on nationality .  
Although the special circumstances of developing countries are recognized in many specific instances throughout the revised version , there is no separate chapter or annex devoted to those circumstances ( as in the previous version ) .  
Portugal 's domestic legislation provided for the criminal responsibility of legal persons , including that of the State , and there were merits in developing the concept of international criminal responsibility , but the draft articles did not include specific consequences attached to a crime as opposed to a mere wrongful act .  
Several options may be considered , such as : ( a ) encouraging governments to provide greater support to national , regional and international institutions ; ( b ) requesting the governing bodies of international organizations to give a high priority to work in support of the UNFCCC process ; ( c ) revising the guidance to the GEF so as to encourage support for specific methodological issues ; and ( d ) providing for additions to the secretariat budget and / or contributions to the supplementary fund for the period 1998-1999 .  
Lastly , the aim should be to elaborate a framework convention enacting the basic principles and setting forth the conceptual basis for eventual bilateral or regional arrangements regarding specific watercourses to be concluded between the watercourse States concerned , taking into account their respective characteristics .  
In considering applications on a case-by-case basis , the Committee viewed as inappropriate requests to supply industrial equipment and raw materials , as well as horticultural produce , except fruits and vegetables , to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , unless such applications contained , in every case , specific explanations of how the commodities and products in question were intended to meet essential humanitarian needs ( see press release SC / 6118 ) .  
In August 1993 , it approved a proposal presented by SAMCOMM , following a meeting of riparian States in Bucharest , that vessels , both powered or non-powered , which carried no goods or commodities , excluding packing material intended for reuse ( empty reels , pallets , etc . ) , could transit without specific prior authorization of the Committee , provided that all movements were notified to the SAMs teams by shipping operators and that the vessels were subject to monitoring before entry to and exit from the Danube portion between Vidin / Calafat and Mohacs .  
The Committee advised applicant States wishing to undertake energy-related exports to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for humanitarian purposes , that it was not in a position to approve the supply of energy-related products to the country for general distribution ; however , without prejudice to its final decision , the Committee expressed readiness to consider requests for authorization of shipments of strictly limited quantities of fuel targeting specific end-users among the most vulnerable groups of civilian population and for purely humanitarian purposes .  
Invites Governments , in accordance with the commitments made at the World Summit for Social Development held at Copenhagen in March 1995 , [ 14 ] / to set specific target dates for eliminating all forms of child labour that are contrary to accepted international standards and ensuring the full enforcement of relevant existing laws and , where appropriate , enacting the legislation necessary to implement obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and International Labour Organization standards ensuring the protection of working children ;  
Please indicate the specific measures adopted to reduce economic , social and geographical disparities , including between rural and urban areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , including children belonging to minorities or indigenous communities , disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children who are non-nationals , migrants , displaced , refugees or asylum _ seekers , and children who are living and / or working on the streets .  
Please describe specific measures taken to guarantee the child 's right to life and to create an environment conducive to ensuring to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child , including physical , mental , spiritual , moral , psychological and social development , in a manner compatible with human dignity , and to prepare the child for an individual life in a free society .  
In the economic and social sectors , services of gratis personnel have been contributed by Governments and institutes to assist in carrying out work at Headquarters , primarily in areas where specific expertise was required to assist the Secretariat , for example , national accounts , research and analysis of the world economic and social situation , development of indicators of sustainable development and monitoring programmes of action and other international instruments in the economic and social sectors .  
Recalling the importance of preserving the independence of the Secretariat , the Open-ended High-level Working Group on the Strengthening of the United Nations System , in its report to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session ( A / 50 / 24 ) , stated that positions funded from extrabudgetary resources or personnel on loan from Member States were only acceptable on a temporary basis for specific short-term projects or pending a transition , which should be accomplished promptly , to budgetary posts funded from assessed contributions .  
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Invites Governments , in accordance with the commitments made at the World Summit for Social Development held at Copenhagen in March 1995 , [ 30 ] to set specific target dates for eliminating all forms of child labour that are contrary to accepted international standards and ensuring the full enforcement of relevant existing laws and , where appropriate , enacting the legislation necessary to implement obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child16 and International Labour Organization standards ensuring the protection of working children ;  
Recommends also that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development , and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
Referring to the addendum to the LDCs 1996 Report , which addressed the important issue of strengthening the LDCs ' capacity for participation in the multilateral trading system and identified specific programmes that could ease the economic adjustment burden on the LDCs , he looked forward to a useful discussion on that issue and hoped that it would result in timely inputs to the initiative currently under way in the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) which would be submitted to the Singapore Ministerial Meeting .  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
" Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that our country is prepared to provide , on specific terms , special units of its military forces for demining operations conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and other international organizations , or on a bilateral basis .  A mine-clearance training centre , established in the city of Kamyanets-Podilsky , provides all the facilities necessary to train foreign specialists in this field .  
Nevertheless , the legal institution of reservations may well have to be reassessed in the light of the particular nature of human rights treaties ; this results from their specific object , which is to provide maximum protection for individuals victimized not only by their own Governments but also at the hands of private parties , from their recognition in international and regional jurisprudence as establishing non-reciprocal and objective obligations , and from the existence of treaty monitoring bodies .  
Calls upon the international community to apply , where necessary , the principle of common but differentiated responsibility in ongoing international cooperation on the protection of the environment and in efforts to implement existing instruments of international environmental law and the elaboration of new instruments , and to continue to take fully into account specific circumstances and requirements , in particular , those of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , thus facilitating their compliance with their obligations under international agreements ;  
In that connection , bearing in mind that the draft Code and the international criminal court would form part of a single international legal regime , he hoped that the court 's statute would provide more specific guidance on issues which were not clearly defined in , or omitted from , the draft Code .  
BAKER ( Israel ) shared the view expressed by the Commission as to the difficulty of distinguishing between codification and progressive development of international law , especially in an era in which the development of international law took place in specialized spheres through the activities of various institutions , the regionalization of the handling of specific issues and an increase in law-making bodies , whether private or official , formal or informal .  
This finding was based on an extensive discussion of Mali 's recent history , led and informed by two Ministers from that country who described their Government 's determination to involve all segments of the population in the peace process , to recognize the specific development needs of the north , to reintegrate former combatants into civil society , to help resettle refugees and to provide a secure environment conducive to disarmament .  
Invites the executive heads of the organizations of the common system to develop and submit proposals , as a matter of priority , to their relevant intergovernmental bodies on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , these proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General ;  
Requests the Commission to take the lead in analysing new approaches in the human resources management field so as to develop standards , methods and arrangements that will respond to the specific needs , especially regarding future staffing , of the organizations of the common system including , inter alia , consideration of flexible contractual arrangements , performance-based pay and the introduction of special occupational pay rates , and to report to the General Assembly thereon at its fifty-third session .  Replace the tables in paragraph ( b ) ( i ) by the following :  
Invites the executive heads of the organizations of the common system to develop and submit proposals , as a matter of priority , to their relevant intergovernmental bodies on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , these proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General ;  
Requests the Commission to take the lead in analysing new approaches in the human resources management field so as to develop standards , methods and arrangements that will respond to the specific needs , especially regarding future staffing , of the organizations of the common system , including , inter alia , consideration of flexible contractual arrangements , performance-based pay and the introduction of special occupational pay rates , and to report to the General Assembly thereon at its fifty-third session . 
In conformity with paragraph 11 ( a ) of its revised methods of work ( see annex I ) , the Working Group , without in any way prejudging the final assessment of whether the detention was arbitrary or not , drew the attention of each of the Governments concerned to the specific case as reported and appealed to it to take the necessary measures to ensure that the detained persons ' right to life and to physical integrity was respected .  
There should be a specific provision in the operative part of the statute devoted to the principle of complementarity which would define the nature and scope of cooperation between the court and national judicial systems , and the obligation of States parties to cooperate with the court in an effective and speedy manner .  
At later stages of planning , the Secretariat will require more detailed information , such as the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number and types of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , and information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . , ammunition ) , and any specific handling instructions .  
Any specific agreements should take into account the special geographic , climatic , historical and hydrological characteristics of a given river , as well as previous bilateral and multilateral agreements and the customary uses of its water resources .  
Conscious of the human rights and dignity of all refugee children and adolescents and that , due to their specific needs and vulnerability within the broader refugee population , they need to be among the first to receive protection and assistance in any refugee situation , Gravely concerned that refugee children and adolescents continue to be exposed to family separation , physical violence and other violations of their human rights , including through sexual abuse and exploitation , and military or armed attacks ,  
It was pointed out that in some jurisdictions the relief that could be granted by the court before the opening of insolvency proceedings or before recognition of a foreign proceeding was limited to relief measures of an individual nature provided under national rules on civil procedure ( i.e . measures covering specific assets identified by a creditor ) and did not extend to special relief measures available under special rules concerning collective insolvency proceedings .  
Emphasizing the importance of the democratic , efficient , transparent and representative governing structures of the United Nations Environment Programme , with a complementary , specific and distinct role and mandate for each of their components ,  
The international community must take specific measures designed to act on the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the obligation to pursue and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
I believe that it is possible to plan a special session that would be different from the routine , one that would focus on adopting a considerable number of major initiatives to implement the outcome of the Summit action-oriented initiatives , and initiatives of implementation and on negotiations not on texts but on specific action at the national , regional and international levels .  
We do not wish these meetings to be transformed into routine or symbolic occasions , but to become a forum for candid and transparent discussions on all issues related to specific troops participating in peacekeeping operations .  
The fact that we have been able to emerge with dignity from the most critical phase in our independent development is , to a large extent , to the credit of the United Nations and its specialized agencies , which provided Georgia not only with moral support but with specific and timely financial and technical assistance . 
We must see to it that these trends are strengthened and that the way is cleared for specific , tangible steps that would make it possible to move to address in practical terms the question of the cessation of the armed conflict and the start of a political dialogue aimed at national reconciliation and the establishment in Afghanistan of a broad-based , fully representative government .  
But the main specific feature is that all these Republics are in the process of building a State , and therefore give the highest priority to the issues of peace , security and stability in their domestic and foreign policies , because only with these basic conditions is sustainable economic and social development possible .  
You have moved forward in several areas , such as the management of forests and fresh water , in the commitment to discuss energy and transport from the perspective of sustainable development and in more specific actions , such as the phasing out of leaded gasoline and the ambitious work programme you have set for the Commission on Sustainable Development .  
The latter includes : ( i ) general actions related to shelter , services and settlement-wide issues ; ( ii ) actions for families in especially difficult circumstances ( including those in critical housing conditions , the homeless , female headed households and evicted families ) ; and ( iii ) specific actions for children ( mainly children in especially difficult circumstances ) .  
The four specific action areas laid out in the mission statement - operational assistance , advancement of understanding of the issues , encouragement of social and economic development through migration , and upholding the human dignity and well-being of migrants - permeate the Programme of Action , too , and provide a solid basis for IOM 's institutional commitment to moving the international consensus reached at the International Conference on Population and Development towards concrete action .  
Since 1977 , in the light of the considerable increase in the number of children having to begin a form of education completely different from that of their country of origin and unrelated to their native language , and in the middle of the school year , special primary classes have been set up to smooth their transition and a specific teaching method developed to help them learn French quickly . 
These human rights are reinforced by the principles of participatory democracy , which assumes the involvement of PLHAs and their families , women , children and groups vulnerable to HIV / AIDS in designing and implementing programmes that will be most effective by being tailored to the specific needs of these groups .  
In a democratic society , the typical functions of the armed forces relate to the defence of sovereignty and territorial integrity ; any other function is atypical and exceptional ; like any other government institution , their exercise of other functions must take place in a context of subordination to lawfully constituted authority and be preceded by a decision of and be monitored by the lawfully constituted authorities of the State within their specific sphere of competence . 
The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors , including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans , the capacity of political parties to fulfil people 's expectations , the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education , all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen .  The electoral process is marred by specific shortcomings which impede the effective enjoyment of the right to vote .  
In respect of persons who were involved in the internal armed conflict owing to institutional mandates , the National Reconciliation Act shall contain specific provisions equivalent to those previously mentioned , in that they shall extinguish criminal liability for common crimes perpetrated with the aim of preventing , thwarting , suppressing or punishing the commission of political crimes and related common crimes , where such crimes were directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to that aim , unless it is demonstrated that there is no relationship between the criminal act and the stated aim .  
In order to gather specific information on preparations for the Year , United Nations Member States , United Nations bodies and specialized agencies , and selected non-governmental organizations were requested to provide information on the establishment of focal points for the Year and designate priorities for their preparatory activities within the four dimensions of the conceptual framework for the Year .  
It was envisaged that implementation of Agenda 21 would require active involvement of all relevant international institutions , both within and outside the United Nations system , that are dealing with specific economic , social or environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
Moreover , analysis of trafficking trends and of conclusions thereon , as well as of specific trafficking routes and methods , is often incomplete as a result of the scarcity of individual seizure reports transmitted by Governments to international organizations and the relatively low rates of interception of illicit drug trafficking in some of the key trafficking countries and regions .  
Furthermore , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
In possession of considerable information relating to alleged serious violations of human rights in Nigeria , and in the absence either of a substantive response from the Government concerning specific allegations transmitted during the year or of the opportunity to visit the country , the Special Rapporteurs were thus required at least to inform the General Assembly about the substance of allegations received and to draw such preliminary conclusions as may be possible by reference to , e.g . , declared laws and acknowledged practices .  
With a view to finding durable and concrete solutions to the problem of the sale and commercial sexual exploitation of children , the Special Rapporteur is making an urgent appeal to Governments , non-governmental organizations , and all concerned agencies and individuals , to keep her informed on a regular and sustained basis of developments in matters under her mandate , including specific situations of child abuse in any country .  
In its response , UNICEF referred to the report prepared by the expert of the Secretary-General , Ms . Gra \ x { 84f7 } Michel , on the impact of armed conflict on children , submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 48 / 157 ( see A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) .  Although the report gives extensive information on violations of the rights of women and children , it does not provide specific information pertinent to the release of women and children taken hostage in armed conflict and imprisoned .  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
In this connection , the Parsi minority is one of the most active and prosperous in India , both in the economic field as well as in terms of private school establishments , and also one of those that attaches the greatest importance to maintaining itself as a specific and distinct ethnic and religious community .  
As cholera is now thought to be endemic in Somalia , agencies , having learned from four years of experience , have designed specific prevention and control plans with the local communities to ensure water chlorination and to prevent the spread of the disease through social mobilization campaigns on country-wide radio broadcasts , local billboards , flyers and messages delivered through religious leaders .  
The General Assembly in its resolution 51 / 64 , section IV , decided to convene , for three days in June 1998 , a special session in order to consider the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities , and to propose new strategies , methods , practical activities and specific measures to strengthen international cooperation in addressing the problem of illicit drugs .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 51 / 64 , section IV , decided to convene a special session in order to consider the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities and to propose new strategies , methods , practical activities and specific measures to strengthen international cooperation in addressing the problem of illicit drugs .  
The team 's examination of the UNEP organizational chart ( see appendix ) and related material defining functional responsibilities , suggests that the functions and authorities are broadly defined at the divisional level but less so at the subdivisional level , where clusters of staff form key groups responsible for specific functions within the overall responsibility of a division . 
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Accordingly , and as long as the faction leaders , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their conflict in Somalia and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law related to internal armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia irrespective of whether the specific area is engulfed in active fighting .  
Using all preventive , educational , medical and legal information available , such programmes should raise the awareness of youth of the negative consequences of drug abuse and should be tailored individually to target specific groups of potential young abusers ;  
On the basis of a set of background documents and a compendium of summarized project proposals the informal consultative group stressed the importance of crime prevention and criminal justice in development , analysed the role of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme , its comparative advantages and potential , and recommended specific modalities of resource mobilization , after having reviewed national policies and practices relating to development-assistance funding .  
It was also agreed as to a more precise mandate for the Working Group that the uniform rules to be prepared should deal with such issues as : the legal basis supporting certification processes , including emerging digital authentication and certification technology ; the applicability of the certification process ; the allocation of risk and liabilities of users , providers and third parties in the context of the use of certification techniques ; the specific issues of certification through the use of registries ; and incorporation by reference .  
However , one of the difficulties of undertaking work in the area of electronic signatures stemmed from the fact that , if the uniform rules to be prepared were to provide the level of guidance that might be required to implement the principles embodied in article 7 of the Model Law , they might have to deviate from a purely functional approach , and to address in some detail the manner in which specific techniques could perform the above-mentioned functions .  
If such an approach was to be adopted , the following alternatives could be considered : to leave it for national conflict-of-laws rules to determine the law applicable to the questions of liability and damages ; to draft a specific uniform conflict-of-laws rule ; or to determine directly which conflict-of-laws rule should be applied ( e.g . , the conflict-of-laws rule of the country in which the certification authority was registered or otherwise authorized to do business ) .  
As agricultural commodities continued to play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries , there was a continuing need to increase market transparency , to improve the transmission of price signals , to seek consensus among exporters and importers on policies , to pursue commodity development activities , to address environmental concerns in specific commodities and to seek WTO compatible means to handle commodity price instability .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Successful efforts have been made to sensitize public opinion and to mobilize international cooperation , as well as to adopt specific programmes to implement Agenda 21 and to establish relevant institutional mechanisms at the international , regional , national and local levels . 
That framework was built on an innovative model that combined central coordination functions , vested in the mandates of the Administrative Committee on Coordination and the newly established Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , and decentralized allocation of specific responsibilities to relevant organizations of the United Nations system , based on their comparative strengths , to act as task managers for various programme components of Agenda 21 .  
Even though there was no specific mention to this effect in the response received from the Netherlands , it is known that the country , along with other developed countries , such as Japan , participates in triangular arrangements , whereby the services of suitable developing countries are utilized to deliver a technical cooperation input to another developing country .  
In paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 50 / 97 , the Secretary-General is requested to convene another meeting of governmental experts from land-locked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems in the land-locked and transit developing countries with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating specific action-oriented measures [ 1 ] .  
Detailed and specific projects for each of the eight countries , focused on a combination of training and supportive measures to strengthen supply capabilities based on the needs already identified , have been prepared for each country and currently await formal approval from the country authorities concerned .  
Notes that the prevention of mass exoduses requires lasting and effective solutions and requires bilateral and multilateral efforts with specific commitments and effective contributions to developing countries in order to promote the realization of all human rights , in particular the right to development , and welcomes in this regard the holistic approach to promotion and protection of human rights adopted by the High Commissioner .  
Also , more effective use will be made of policy seminars , conferences and training workshops addressed to specific development issues , bringing together senior national policy makers and representatives of civil society and the private sector and facilitating a shared understanding of the development challenges that African countries face and the policy options that are available .  
The Sub-Commission , at its forty-eighth session , in its resolution 1996 / 30 , requested the Special Rapporteur to update the list of States which have proclaimed , extended or terminated a state of emergency with a view to its consideration by the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session , and requested him to submit final conclusions on the protection of human rights during states of emergency , together with specific recommendations as to how this question should be dealt with in the future .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
The Special Rapporteur suggests that special rapporteurs and working groups pay particular attention to the impact of emergency situations on the specific area covered by their respective mandates and that , as the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has repeatedly stated , they should avail themselves of the valuable collaboration which the Special Rapporteur on human rights and states of emergency would be able to provide , in the event that such a Special Rapporteur were to be appointed by the Commission . 
Thus the topic will be limited only to codification of secondary rules on the subject : while addressing the requirement of a violation of an international obligation of the State as a prerequisite , it will not address the specific content of those international legal obligations , whether under customary or treaty law .  
The expected outcome of the Conference is a Lisbon Declaration on Youth Policies and Programmes by ministers responsible for youth to further promote the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond through more focused and specific intersectoral measures at the regional , national and local / municipal levels .  
Noting with concern the absence in the countries concerned of specific legislation to govern offences committed by minor children , the absence of preventive and educational measures for their reintegration into society which would enable minor detainees to become rehabilitated and no longer marginalized , as well as the very limited number of children 's magistrates capable of understanding the problems of delinquent children and seeing that they are cared for ,  
Recalling that in the same resolution the Commission called upon the Sub _ Commission to focus on its primary role as an advisory body of the Commission , to facilitate efficient and effective participation of non _ governmental organizations , to devote sufficient time at its forty _ ninth session to the discussion of its working methods and to prepare specific recommendations on that issue for consideration by the Commission ,  
At the international level , the action plan defined a specific set of complementary actions designed to re-establish the necessary priority for improving agriculture and the rural economy , including two high-profile initiatives .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in these areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , on human health and on environmental protection for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
The emphasis given by the Commission on Sustainable Development at its fourth session to the importance of effective conservation and management of fish stocks , and in particular to eliminating overfishing , in order to identify specific steps at national or regional levels to prevent or eliminate excess fishing capacity , will need to be carried forward in all appropriate international forums including , in particular , the Committee on Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ;  
Countries need to systematically increase the use of renewable energy sources according to their specific social , economic , natural , geographical and climatic conditions and cleaner fuel technologies , including fossil fuel technologies , and to improve efficiency in energy production , distribution and use and in other industrial production processes that are intensive users of energy ;  
We believe that in thinking about the African future they would be well advised to build on well-tested solutions , enriched with their specific local experience and African traditions , bearing in mind that respect for universally recognized standards of democracy , the rule of law and basic human rights lies at the centre of contemporary international relations .  
The ties between the Russian Federation and Egypt that are developing in the economic , cultural , humanitarian and other spheres are based on mutual respect for the specific national and cultural characteristics of the two peoples and their traditions of friendship .  
The General Assembly also invited the executive heads of the organizations of the common system to develop and submit proposals , to their relevant intergovernmental bodies , as a matter of priority , on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , those proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General .  
They needed to be applied impartially , on the basis of specific criteria and a clear timetable , and only when there was a real threat to international peace and security .  The possibility of adopting smart sanctions , which would not affect innocent civilians or cause undue suffering , had been discussed .  
Further , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
As stated in earlier paragraphs , the Ministry of Culture and Education is taking steps under the Social Plan for Education on behalf of low _ income and rural sectors , indigenous communities , children with physical or mental disabilities and specific population groups with a view to ensuring that they may enter and stay in the educational system and strengthening the teaching function of schools by giving priority to strategies to improve in-house training and help eliminate educational inequalities .  
The problem of the widening industrialization and technology gap is acknowledged to be particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa , with 33 of the world 's 48 least developed countries , while macroeconomic stabilization programmes have been adopted by most African countries since the early 1980s in an attempt to create an enabling environment for long-term growth , they have usually not included any specific measures to promote industrial development .  
UNCLOS is acknowledged to be an " umbrella convention " because most of its provisions , being of a general nature , can only be implemented through specific operative regulations to be contained in other international agreements or national law .  
United Nations treaty bodies , special rapporteurs , representatives and independent experts have regularly provided valuable information on specific human rights problems having the potential of generating mass exoduses or preventing their resolution , together with recommendations for corrective measures .  
The inter-agency consolidated appeals will reflect to a greater extent all operational activities performed by humanitarian agencies in specific situations and activities included in appeals will , pursuant to joint consultations , be listed in accordance with the priorities given .  
However , it is our opinion that in order to be successful , any transparency mechanism must be guided by certain specific principles , namely , it must be balanced , comprehensive , non-discriminatory , and fully enhance the national , regional and international security of all States according to the rules of international law .  
Even recent advances in the scientific understanding of these complex events leave much to speculation or , at best , any systematic patterns observed may be highly opportunistic to specific events or individual examples .  
The source reported that in late 1993 , the appeal division of the Supreme Court barred further habeas corpus applications and ruled that in light of the special circumstances and the seriousness of the crimes involved , the SPO detainees were to remain incarcerated without any specific time limit , until they were charged .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
Success in the thematic area of gender will be measured by : ( a ) the extent to which a viable , common regional agenda is established in the area of leadership and women ; ( b ) the extent to which public awareness about violence against women is raised in specific target groups on violence ; ( c ) the extent to which mainstreaming tools are utilized by target groups and disseminated in the region .  
In performing that function , his mandate has crystallized into three main areas of work : ( a ) the development of an appropriate normative framework for meeting the protection and assistance needs of the internally displaced ; ( b ) the promotion of effective institutional arrangements for meeting those needs ; ( c ) focusing , through country visits , on specific situations of internal displacement that the representative , through dialogue with the Government and other actors concerned , aims to ensure are effectively addressed .  
The Inter-Agency Standing Committee equally will need to play a more active role in several respects : assessing the degree to which the needs of the internally displaced are being met by the United Nations system generally as well as in specific situations , calling upon other United Nations agencies to play strong supporting roles in the humanitarian effort , pressing for political action to resolve the crises that create humanitarian emergencies and drawing attention to situations that receive insufficient attention .  
In his reports to the Commission and the General Assembly , the representative has provided information on the magnitude of internal displacement worldwide , has identified specific needs of the internally displaced for protection and assistance , including highlighting the particular problems faced by women and children , has assessed the extent to which those needs are being met under existing normative and institutional frameworks and has reported in detail on specific country situations that he , through his country visits , has studied first-hand .  
Evaluating the extent to which international , regional and national responses address specific crises of internal displacement will be essential both for ensuring that specific situations are effectively addressed and for furthering the development of strategies at the regional and global levels .  
To the supplementary Ariane-5 programmes at rates ranging from 3 to 6 per cent according to the anticipated activities in these three programmes , with the aim of maintaining the high standard of the specific industrial capabilities established in Belgium since the 1970s and thus preserving their advantageous position in the industrial consortium marketing the launch vehicle .  
One delegation , also speaking on behalf of a large group , advanced some specific suggestions to the Task Force , among which was that the free flow of accurate and up-to-date information , taking into account the linguistic diversity of the Organization , must remain the primary function of the Department and that the dissemination of relevant information about the United Nations and its programmes should continue to be a core activity of the Department , particularly in developing countries .

In pursuing this objective , however , it must be remembered that the proceedings of intergovernmental organs and bodies make it imperative to research , write , edit , translate , print and distribute parliamentary documentation for meetings on specific dates , and almost always within short deadlines .  Fulfilling this requirement as efficiently as possible makes it necessary to give higher relative priority to the preparation and processing of documents than of publications , except those that are themselves required for meetings .  
Regarding the preparation of interdisciplinary / joint publications with other regional commissions or entities , the Economic Commission for Europe would suggest that three criteria be met : the decision should be taken on a voluntary basis by interested agencies ; the objective of the publication should be to provide a variety of views and experiences on specific issues ; and the time-frame for publications should be realistic and agreed upon by the organizations involved .  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Recognizing the need for fuller utilization of the material and intellectual potential of the two countries , the development of specific approaches and the creation of mechanisms to facilitate the attainment of practical goals in accordance with the new political , economic and social realities , Make the following declaration :  
The Commission recognizes the value of the recommendations made by the experts , and stresses the specific needs of developing countries , especially LDCs , regarding access to international networks in general and to electronic commerce in particular ; the development of physical infrastructure and human resources , as well as the use of existing or foreseen low-cost solutions ( e.g . Internet , low earth orbit satellites ) , should be enhanced .  
Also welcomes the continuing efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , as appropriate , when requested by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional levels and draw up action programmes ;  
Social , religious and cultural networks can help to represent the specific economic interests of all the different groups in the community , particularly excluded groups ; to ensure that policies reflect the needs and interest of communities ; to ensure that policies do not lead to disintegration of communities ; to collect relevant data and information on the impact of economic policies ; to carry out participatory monitoring of policies ; and to ensure local representation in government structures .  
The final report of the Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1993 / 8 ) contains abundant material on which to base a definition of gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and crimes under international law for the purposes of application of the set of basic principles and guidelines or , where appropriate , the specific provisions mentioned .  
In the view of the League of Arab States , far from being limited to a specific part of the world , the dangerous consequences of terrorism will spread throughout the entire world unless there is international coordination and cooperation to combat this phenomenon , which unquestionably constitutes a flagrant violation of human rights .  
Considering that the cost-effectiveness of space technology applications had been demonstrated in several application domains for improving infrastructures , the participants observed that specific and focused cooperative efforts should be made by international organizations and by national entities to promote the use of appropriate technologies .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
Effective follow-up requires ( a ) that the reports be given active and serious consideration by the legislative organs of the participating organizations , with the benefit of specific and timely comments on them by the secretariats , and ( b ) that there is expeditious implementation of the approved recommendations contained in them , with full reporting on the implementation measures taken and analysis of the resulting impact .  
Once a report is considered by the legislative organs and decisions taken on the report as a whole and on specific recommendations , the executive heads of the concerned organizations will ensure expeditious implementation of approved / accepted recommendations ( see para . 19 below ) and full reporting on measures taken to the appropriate legislative organs .  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission on Human Settlements , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
In specific terms our countries , despite various structural reforms , have been unable to attract in sufficient quantities the necessary capital inflows for investment , and are confronted at the same time with domestic supply-side constraints which limit our export potential , an unsustainable debt which swallows a great part of our national income , and declining levels of official development assistance , among others .  
Here , and with specific reference to reform of the Security Council , Benin strongly recommends that the following principles should be taken into account : an increase in the membership of the Security Council truly reflecting the political and economic configuration of today 's world ; equitable geographical representation of the five regional groups , with the African group entitled to four seats , two permanent and two non-permanent ; and protection of democratic and transparent functioning , ultimately involving the elimination of the right of veto .  
The report reviews the main strategic functions of the Organization and provides for each of them specific proposals charting the way and making Member States real partners in achieving an Organization better prepared to deal with humanitarian and political crises ; based on greater efficiency ; qualified to play a more vital role in the areas specified by the Charter ; and made imperative by the changing security , economic , social and political circumstances of this world .  
Similarly , it is recognized that implementation of the Summit 's Declaration and Programme of Action will require the mobilization of financial resources at the national and international levels and that the specific cases of Africa and the least developed countries will need additional resources and more effective development cooperation and assistance .  
Bearing in mind in particular the specific requests addressed to it by the General Assembly in resolution 51 / 146 , the Special Committee reviewed the implementation of the Declaration relating to the remaining Territories and formulated a series of recommendations with a view to enhancing the pace of decolonization and to promoting the political , economic , social and educational advancement of the peoples in those Territories .  
While adhering to the principles inherent in the Declaration , the Special Committee has in recent years considered the question of decolonization in a more realistic and pragmatic manner , taking into account the prevailing international situation , as well as recognizing the specific conditions in the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories .  
It is precisely because of our recognition of the specific and peculiar problems faced by the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories most of which are small island Territories that suffer from impediments created by the interplay of such factors as economic and geographic size , isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters and lack of technological and financial resources , including problems of accessibility to international credit markets that the international community should give specific priority and attention to the process of decolonization affecting the peoples of those Territories . 
Having regard to the major disarmament and non-proliferation conferences already scheduled for the remaining years of the decade and to the need to concentrate scarce resources on specific and focused disarmament events and on goals attainable in the short term , consensus on the timing of another special session on disarmament and broad agreement on its objectives are vital to the prospects of success .  
The urgent appeal addressed to States in operative paragraph 1 must be clearly focused on the specific objective of eliminating the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines , which , in the final analysis , is the real cause of the problems regarding such weapons .  
Such an approach could be general or specific ; global or regional ; unilateral , bilateral or multilateral ; separate or interconnected ; step-by-step or all-encompassing , depending on the circumstances .  
The most efficient and effective roles of State and market , and of civil society , depend on economic , social , historical , environmental and cultural factors that are specific to each country .  
The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action3 reaffirmed basic principles governing international human rights activities , set out specific goals on a wide number of areas and identified various methods to achieve them .  
While several Governments , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in their replies emphasized the importance of developing a comprehensive approach to the problems of mass exoduses , as well as the need to pay special attention to the continuum of emergency to development assistance , others provided information on more specific programmes or on current developments in their respective countries .  
They emphasized the need for innovative approaches to address the complex and specific migratory flows that were taking place in the CIS States and highlighted the specific international standards that had been developed under the Programme of Action to address modern forms of involuntary and enforced migration , including forcibly displaced persons .  
The programme of the workshop covered four main topics : conceptual issues of poverty in old age ; women as one of the groups at risk , and the process known as the feminization of poverty ; specific issues of poverty among other groups at risk ; disabled and single persons ; and ways to create an enabling environment for the improved well-being of older people .  
Fortunately the 1995 Conference of NPT States parties has helped to identify the way forward by adopting the Principles and objectives for non _ proliferation and disarmament , in which the section on Nuclear disarmament sets out the importance to the international community of three specific objectives : the completion of negotiations for a comprehensive test _ ban treaty no later than 1996 ; the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty ; and systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally .  
The United Nations Statistics Division has been very active in the development of satellite accounts , and proposed a system for integrated environment and economic accounting ( SEEA ) , which was published in 1993.6 Several industrialized and developing countries are presently experimenting with the implementation of satellite accounts through the general application of the SEEA framework to a specific national context ( see box 6 ) . 
As agricultural commodities continued to play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries , there was a continuing need to increase market transparency , to improve the transmission of price signals , to seek consensus among exporters and importers on policies , to pursue commodity development activities , to address environmental concerns in specific commodities and to seek WTO compatible means to handle commodity price instability .  
It also runs specific projects related to : the use of infrared imagery for public agencies , academic and other research institutions ; thermal loss in urban areas ; and the use of NOAA satellite images for the operational definition of cloud systems .  
That framework covered the creation of an enabling global environment for employment growth , policies to enhance the adaptability of the labour market and the efficient use of human resources applicable to countries at all levels of development , as well as policies specific to developing , transition , and industrialized countries .  
Second , specific structures in the economy and labour market , such as persistent occupational segregation and concentration , discrimination in pay , limited representation of women in economic decision-making and collective bargaining structures , and other implicit or explicit policies exclude women from certain economic activities and reinforce their subordination in labour markets .  
What developing country Governments need to bear in mind is that in order to improve the productivity of investment in developing countries , it is of particular importance to improve the functioning of the capital market through institutional innovation , better regulation of the banking sector , supporting credit programmes targeted at specific groups , and increasing the supply of venture capital .  
Moreover , family allowances are not common in developing countries , unemployment insurance rarely exists , and social security contributions are generally lower than in OECD countries . 7 Therefore , while some parts of the labour market regulations in developing countries are no longer compatible with today 's economic situation , whether or not there is a need for reform has to be ascertained from a specific examination of the empirical evidence . 
The Kathmandu workshop proved to be a crucial turning point when , for the first time in the series of meetings , it focused on regional arrangements , explored available options , identified specific steps as building-blocks , and concluded with a clear consensus in the form of agreed workshop conclusions .  
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
The people of Cuba as a whole are called upon to continue the profound and systematic examination of the annexationist and colonialist plans of the Government of the United States of America included in the Helms-Burton Act as a means of ensuring that in every territory , community , workplace , educational institution and military unit there is full knowledge of the specific consequences that the execution of these plans would entail for each and every citizen , and to guarantee everyone 's active and conscientious participation in the measures needed to defeat them .  
In previous reports the information and data available to the Special Rapporteur were grouped in chapters on specific categories of violations of human rights such as summary executions , arbitrary arrests , torture , violations of the rights of the child and the rights of women , freedom of expression and movement , etc . with additional paragraphs , whenever necessary , on special questions , such as incidents which prevented humanitarian activities or the situation in the Nuba Mountains .  
The Commission requested the Secretary-General to establish in the Centre for Human Rights a focal unit with the specific task of following up on the findings of the Special Rapporteur and other issues related to the adverse effects of the illicit movement and dumping of toxic and dangerous products and wastes on the enjoyment of human rights .  
Invites the executive heads of the organizations of the United Nations common system to develop and submit proposals to their relevant intergovernmental bodies , as a matter of priority , on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , these proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General ;  
Requests the International Civil Service Commission to take the lead in analysing new approaches in the human resources management field so as to develop standards , methods and arrangements that will respond to the specific needs , especially regarding future staffing , of the organizations of the United Nations common system , including consideration of flexible contractual arrangements , performance-based pay and the introduction of special occupational pay rates , and to report to the General Assembly thereon at its fifty-third session .

Other important factors determining possible programmes of technical cooperation that HC / CHR provides to Member States at their request are : specific recommendations made by the United Nations human rights treaty monitoring bodies ; recommendations by the Commission on Human Rights and its mechanisms , including the representatives of the Secretary-General , the special rapporteurs on thematic or country situations and the various working groups ; the recommendations adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation ; and the views expressed by national human rights institutions and national and international NGOs .  
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .

Unfortunately , there is no reliable comprehensive data on the economic aspects of natural disasters ; as a result policy makers can not base their decisions on documented facts , and cost-benefit analyses of specific natural disaster prevention or reduction measures are often questionable .  
Many of those interviewed by the Central Evaluation Unit stated that background papers and proposals for policy decisions were usually distributed too late , and as a result agency representatives often did not come to the meetings prepared to act on proposals ; many meetings had been convened with no concrete objectives set ; and work initiated by the Working Group on specific issues had been pursued in an on-and-off fashion , only reaching conclusion three to four years after initiation .  
In the inter-agency follow-up to Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 56 of 28 July 1995 , agencies agreed that a lead agency might be designated to carry out the functions of operational coordination for a specific target group , geographical area or technical sector ; and that the lead agency would be accountable to the resident / humanitarian coordinator . 
The documentation received from the Economic and Social Council and its bodies is of great interest to World YWCA and is shared as appropriate with newly developing and member national associations in 95 countries through specific correspondence , general mailings of reproduced United Nations information / publications , the monthly publication Advocacy and Briefing Notes and quarterly publications with more extensive coverage of selected issues .

As planned , the Task Force produced a synthesis report for use by the resident coordinator system , summarizing lessons of experience at the country level and across countries with a view to suggesting ways of improving inter-agency collaboration in the future and providing a clear understanding of the different ingredients that work for the promotion of employment and sustainable livelihoods in specific situations and of the necessary indicators for monitoring progress in these areas .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
United Nations technical cooperation assistance to developing countries takes into account their specific needs caused by small size and low level of economic and social development .

Countries need to systematically increase the use of renewable energy sources according to their specific social , economic , natural , geographical and climatic conditions and cleaner fuel technologies , including fossil fuel technologies , and to improve efficiency in energy production , distribution and use and in other industrial production processes that are intensive users of energy ;  
When genetic variations are lost , therefore , the result is not only that specific and potential properties and adaptations are lost but also that the number of species is diminished , ecosystems are impaired and the ability to sustain human life is damaged .  
It should determine specific measures to foster an enabling international environment conducive to providing developing countries with increased financial and technical assistance , access to financial flows on a predictable and assured basis , increased foreign direct investment and a durable solution to debt problems .

Reaffirms that the objective of capacity-building and its sustainability should continue to be an essential part of the operational activities of the United Nations system at the country level and should be country-driven and situation specific , and should be based on the programme approach , to the extent possible , consistent with national development plans and priorities ;  
In paragraph 11 of the resolution the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General to convene in 1997 another meeting of governmental experts from land-locked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems in the land-locked and transit developing countries and to explore the possibility of formulating specific action-oriented measures .

The nature of the interventions will vary according to the specific context , but the measures outlined below , among others , may be considered in the interest of consolidating national security , preventing further regional proliferation and combating illicit arms trafficking ( understood to cover international trade in conventional arms that is contrary to the law of States and / or international law ) , thereby contributing to conflict prevention in the process of post-conflict peace-building .  
They also agreed that regular meetings between their senior military and security officials , as well as joint military exercises and patrols and participation in subregional or regional peace operations , would help not only to tackle specific concerns such as controlling the illicit trade in arms and drugs and helping to resolve specific conflicts , but also to enhance overall transparency and confidence among Central African States .

Such adverse effects may occur not only whenever specific postal material is the subject of sanctions , but also when air traffic to a sanctioned State is interrupted or suspended .  
Noting with concern the absence in the countries concerned of specific legislation to govern offences committed by minor children , the absence of preventive and educational measures for their reintegration into society which would enable minor detainees to become rehabilitated and no longer marginalized , as well as the very limited number of children 's magistrates capable of understanding the problems of delinquent children and seeing that they are cared for ,  
The States participating in the Regional Ministerial Workshop decided that the early formulation of national positions was essential to ensure that their specific concerns would be appropriately reflected in the text of an international convention against organized transnational crime .  
Where developing countries have been watchful of the cost of incentives and applied them within an outward-oriented approach , microeconomic measures addressing specific supply constraints have helped build supply capabilities which the private sector could not have accomplished as rapidly by itself . \ x { ffff } seq level0 \ * arabic \ x { ffff } 24 \ x { ffff } .

One important task of the United Nations was that of providing States , Governments , non-governmental organizations and representatives of public organizations with better information with a view to seeking solutions to urgent problems encountered by most of the world 's countries , promoting international assistance and implementing specific economic and social programmes and projects at the national , regional and international levels . 
He urged the international community to adopt specific measures to stabilize the international economic environment , thereby supporting the developing countries in their efforts to mitigate the political and social costs of structural adjustment policies and economic reforms , rather than simply limiting themselves to the re-establishment of their credit ratings and the liberalization of their markets at all costs .  
By this all or nothing approach practised in the CD this year , concrete progress on specific and timely issues , issues ripe for multilateral negotiation , was held hostage to demands for an agreement to negotiate multilaterally nuclear disarmament in a time _ bound framework .  
In the context of the achievements of a first generation of policy reforms in terms of trade liberalization , price stability , lower fiscal deficits and improved balance of payments , the Group believes that a dynamic and competitive environment , underpinned by competition policy and legislation adequately tailored to a countrys specific circumstances , is an essential characteristic of successful second _ generation policy reforms .  
The Government of China maintains that sovereign equality , non-interference in each other 's internal affairs and other norms governing international relations must be respected , and that each country is entitled to choose its own social system and mode of development in the light of its specific national conditions .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
We are deeply convinced that such an approach will increase the responsibility of each littoral State for the consequences of activities in its own sector ; make possible the effective legal regulation of the use of marine resources on the basis of national legislation ; make it easier to attract foreign investment to the region , which in turn will contribute to the region 's economic growth ; and minimize the likelihood of disputes among States concerning specific deposits in the Caspian Sea .  
Similarly , the Department 's publication , Image &amp; amp ; Reality , the single publication devoted to help correct common misconceptions about the United Nations , has been thoroughly revised to counter criticisms about the Organization , both in specific areas such as peacekeeping and more generally as part of current debate over reform .

In this connection , the expert group stressed the importance of the progressive development and codification of relevant norms of international law ( e.g . the law of State responsibility , including countermeasures in response to international wrongful acts or prior injury ) as well as specific enforcement provisions or mechanisms incorporated in international regimes , which provide a universally accepted basis for judging the legitimacy of the use of economic coercion under certain circumstances ( see sect .  B below ) .  
Activities include : preparing working documents and a draft report of the Board on the implementation of article 12 of the 1988 Convention ; providing Governments with relevant information to determine the legitimacy of shipments of precursor chemicals and to advise them regarding decisions on specific suspicious shipments ; preparing critical review documents and other relevant materials for the Board and its advisory expert group and for establishing a limited international special surveillance list ; and providing substantive advice on activities related to precursor control .

A substantive discussion of the specific issues and implications arising from the study was beyond the scope of the Panel 's deliberations , although it recognized the key importance of fundamental economic principles in determining the future of forests .  
The key element of the crime of genocide is the specific intent on the part of the perpetrator to physically destroy , in whole or in part , a protected group , namely a national , ethnic , racial , or religious group .  
Given the results of the sampling projects , the Panel determined that a logistic regression model should be applied to all losses in the target group to predict whether specific losses should be classified as for lost or stolen motor vehicles or for repairs .

The Convention has sought to codify certain specific serious crimes committed with the intent to destroy , in whole or in part , a national , ethnical , racial or religious group as crimes under international law .  
Even though the prime objective of the 1993 SNA is clearly to enable countries to compile their specific economic data set , an important secondary objective is to improve the international database on national accounts .  
UNCTAD has also concluded that it is not practical to prescribe a specific curriculum for general knowledge since this is a function of many different cultural , sociological and environmental factors , and should be decided at the national level .  
As training materials needed to reflect a rapidly changing technology and specific local conditions , they had to be both flexible and based on simple principles with wide and durable applicability .  
Formulating policies favourable to the development in rural and poor urban areas of health programmes , including safe water supply , sanitation , and waste disposal , taking into account the specific needs of young women and young men for a healthy environment ;

In an era when ethnic conflict and civil war have become increasingly common in comparison to international armed conflicts , the responsibility of a new Government to pay for past violations may require a specific guiding principle , which should be incorporated in the guidelines .  
The FAO assessment will be forward looking , and will be carried out in the light of the basic principles and operational guidelines published by FAO in 1996 , as well as the specific elements to be considered during the development and implementation of national forest programmes , as endorsed by IPF ( see E / CN . 17 / 1997 / 12 ) .  
On this point some delegations expressed preference for a framework convention , arguing that States would be bound by the provisions of such an instrument without losing the freedom to conclude more detailed bilateral or multilateral agreements with respect to specific hazardous or harmful activities or geographical regions with a high concentration of such activities .  
To be most effective in achieving sustainable forest management , economic instruments should be designed with a specific policy objective in mind ; they should also be well integrated into the broader macroeconomic and multisectoral policy context .  
This would be accomplished by capitalizing on existing and potential public and private-sector financial resources , primarily at the global level , with a specific view to leveraging higher levels of private sector finance .  
As the independent expert pointed out in her two previous reports , as long as the warlords , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their fight in Somalia , and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law relating to non _ international armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia , irrespective of whether a specific area is engulfed in active fighting or not .  
At the normative level , it is important to emphasize that , despite the specific nature of today 's armed conflicts , the international community seems to have at its disposal a sufficient arsenal of legal instruments to protect civilian populations .  
The second level is a complex one that involves a specific mechanism consisting of various interrelated elements , ranging from the body of international humanitarian norms and provisions to the agencies authorized to ensure the rights of the civilian population in situations of armed conflict and to provide humanitarian assistance for them , and so on . 
Some of those institutions have special loan programmes under which they become the sole lender of record to a project , acting on its own behalf and on behalf of participating banks and assuming responsibility for processing disbursements by participants and for subsequent collection and distribution of loan payments received from the borrower , either pursuant to specific agreements or other rights that are available under their status of preferred creditor .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
If , for those reasons , such specific form requirements were to remain outside the scope of the Uniform Rules , the additional benefit to be expected from using an enhanced electronic signature as opposed to a mere electronic signature might need to be further clarified , possibly in the context of draft article B . The Working Group agreed that discussion as to that issue might need to be reopened at a later stage . 
Its specific objective was to assist Member States within that region to formulate recommendations and action plans for , inter alia , ( a ) enhancing Member States ' understanding of the role and use of space technology in social and economic development ; ( b ) addressing problems associated with implementing space technology and space-application programmes ; and ( c ) improving and facilitating regional and international collaboration efforts .

Where specific legislation is required in order for the contracting authority to carry out certain types of projects , the relevant statute often sets forth the conditions for the operation and maintenance of the relevant infrastructure facilities and is supplemented by more detailed provisions in regulations governing that particular infrastructure sector and in the project agreement , an approach that is common to various legal systems .  
In some countries , practical guidance provided to domestic contracting authorities advises them to consider carefully whether and under what circumstances such guarantees are required , which specific risks or loss they should cover and which type of guarantee is best suited in each case .  The ability of the project company to raise finance for the project may be jeopardized by bond requirements set at an excessive level .  
The fact that an act of corruption of a public official has been committed within the sphere of operations of the organized criminal group to facilitate its unlawful activities shall be regarded as a specific aggravating circumstance .  
The absence of a consolidated text of the various provisions tends to inhibit focused and systematic attention to migrants as a specific vulnerable social group , and makes the tasks of the relevant advocacy bodies more difficult .  
It was therefore necessary to formulate specific legislation and policies in the legal , economic , political and social fields and , at the same time , to promote the participation of non-governmental organizations and of society as a whole , as well as greater coordination and participation by the specialized agencies of the United Nations system .  In that connection , it was vital to maintain the valuable contribution of UNICEF and of the Committee on the Rights of the Child .  
The countries of the region , aware that poverty prevented many children in developing countries from exercising their right to education and development , had set themselves priorities in the areas of education , health , food and nutrition and specific targets for children and adolescents in need of special care , such as children who worked or engaged in marginal activities , street children and children who were disabled , abused , orphans or victims of armed conflicts .  
The Russian Federation was implementing the provisions of the conference under difficult economic conditions , but within a firm legal framework which included a national plan of action for the advancement of women to the year 2000 and specific federal programmes .  
Being cognizant of the fact that securing equal rights for women and ensuring their active participation in political , economic and social life constitute key factors in accelerating development , the Government has been following a specific policy on improving the status of women .  
In the national programme on improving the status of women , specific objectives were put forward under the strategic thrust of bettering the scope and quality of reproductive health services , which include the following : to offer once every two years to all women preventive medical check-ups ; to make them healthier ; and to activate health advocacy , training , publicity , information dissemination and counselling for the general public .  
Such assistance can be classified in three general categories : ( i ) those contributing to national capacity-building through the establishment of new electoral institutions or the strengthening of existing capabilities ; ( ii ) those which relate to the human rights aspects of the electoral process ; and ( iii ) those which provide specific , legal , constitutional , logistic or technical advice or various types of electoral equipment and supplies .  
In addition , it was observed that the result would rather be that the draft Convention validated such assignments , as a matter of civil or commercial law , while leaving to other law specific challenges to their validity ( e.g . , the invalidation of an assignment made within the suspect period before the opening of an insolvency proceeding as a fraudulent or preferential transfer ) . 
More effective use will be made of policy seminars , conferences , and training workshops addressed to specific development issues , bringing together senior national policy makers and representatives of civil society and the private sector and facilitating a shared understanding of the development challenges that African countries face and the policy options that are available .

At this point , the Special Rapporteur is prepared to offer , first , some general conclusions applicable to the issues of the study as a whole ; and then to provide more specific conclusions regarding the two main categories of currently existing situations in which indigenous peoples live in multi _ national societies : those in which treaties , agreements or other constructive arrangements exist , and those lacking such juridical instruments .  
On the other hand , the Special Rapporteur is inclined to argue in favour of the proposition that treaties / agreements or constructive arrangements have the potential to become very important tools ( because of their consensual basis ) for formally establishing and implementing not only the rights and freedoms alluded to in the preceding paragraph , but also inalienable ancestral rights , in particular land rights , in the specific context of a given society .

Apart from training of developing human resources at the basic level of science and technology and fostering South-South cooperation , the regional centres for space science and technology education and relevant existing national institutions should organize specific training programmes to contribute to the building of regional and local expertise and ultimately to the success of know-how and technology transfer programmes .  
I . 10 ) ; that progress towards the implementation of the right to development requires effective development policies at the national level , equitable economic relations and a favourable economic environment at the international level ( ibid . ) ; and that the international community should make all efforts to alleviate specific problems , such as the external debt burden of developing countries , to supplement the efforts of the Governments of those countries .

He proposed four specific issues that could be examined by the experts during the Meeting : The first related to the lack of tangible benefits flowing from the Marrakesh Ministerial Declaration on least developed countries ( LDCs ) and net food-importing developing countries ( NFIDCs ) , especially in the light of the declining level of food aid available to those countries in recent years .  
The simple classification of a country as a net exporter or net importer could , however , be misleading in understanding the country-specific impact of the Agreement , as many NFIDCs also had a substantial level of export interest in specific commodities ( mainly cash-crop commodities such as coffee , tea , cotton , soy beans and sugar ) in terms of their shares of total export earnings .  
While the previous decades left a negative heritage , as is summarized below , the political and financial commitment to investment in education that led to UPE in 1997 promises to remedy the inherited dissociation between political and economic governance and open the way towards defining the right to education within Ugandas specific international and domestic environment .

It found that sexual assault formed an integral part of the process of destroying the Tutsi ethnic group and that the rape was systematic and had been perpetrated against Tutsi women only , manifesting the specific intent required for those acts to constitute genocide .  
In the current stage of global developments , there is still a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution to each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations ;

She stated that specific action related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries required action on two fronts : improvement of physical infrastructure and removal of non-physical obstacles , including better utilization of assets and improved managerial , procedural , regulatory and institutional systems .  
The authorities in landlocked and transit developing countries , in consultation with each other , should identify and take measures designed to reduce transit costs , and in this connection may seek assistance from the international community and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development ( UNCTAD ) in undertaking feasibility studies and analyses of specific conditions prevailing in subregional / regional contexts as and when requested by the concerned States .  
One of the key aspects of operational activities for development is facilitating the transfer of technology and expanding the access to technological information , and the creation of information flows on affordable and sustainable technology which is suitable to a specific country , establishing information networks with relevant institutions and business firms .

These are the verses I have found . Pondering them , we can find that Christian love is pure , bright , just , selfless , hateless and for all . On the contrary , anything that is biased , narrow , distorted and bears a specific purpose can not be considered " love " but rather will contaminate the word of God .  
In selecting the subject matter for each series , the group tries to adhere to some specific guidelines . There are four main areas which serve as sources of stamp subjects . The first of these are themes drawn from the rich cultural heritage of Chinese tradition . Other selections are made in accordance with certain international activities such as the " International Year of the Child " , and still another criteria for selection are important current events .  
A test that uses a simple instrument to measure the thermal conductivity of a suspicious stone will also quickly and conclusively separate diamond from cubic zirconia . Tedious specific gravity tests are not necessary . Moreover , specific gravity measurements can only be made on unmounted stones , whereas visual observation and thermal conductivity testing can easily be performed on mounted stones .  
A : Naturally , reports on the dark side of specific cases are more newsworthy . For example , anytime we have a press conference , we always send notices to reporters three days in advance . But news about our seminar on a lobbying law and improper back-door influence got only a small amount of space in the papers , whereas the Feng An stock case was played up by the media for four days straight , from the time they got the notices to the press conference .  
In films depicting ancient events like Mulan Enlists , they employed the incidents and the words of historical figures to either encourage patriotic sentiment in their viewers or to vilify the traitors who had shamelessly sold out their country . Although this infuriated the Japanese and their Chinese collaborators ; there was nothing specific that they could cite as a violation . This made them intolerable . "  
In another article , Huang Jui-mao has observed : " A city is an artificial environment created by human beings over time , imbued with collective emotions accumulated over long periods of the human struggle for existence , and expressed in a real spatial environment through the concerns and practical operation of a specific culture .  
He says , " True religion takes the self-awareness of the innateness of individual being as its foundation . This either calls up innate understanding and comprehension , or establishes active and positive beliefs , providing the truth about the end of the universe , the ultimate purpose of human life , and paths to follow to achieve the liberation of the soul , and other specific answers . Individual beings then make a choice depending upon their free will and their spiritual needs " ( p . 185 ) .  
No matter whether you are talking about the Tatun Mountains or the tail end of the Huoshan and Hsuehshan Mountains toward Keelung , anyone looking from a ship at sea would not have seen some narrow , specific little point . Perhaps we will never be able to figure out which place it was that inspired " Formosa , " but the most reasonable explanation still seems to be that ships were passing Taiwan 's northern edge . This theory also says something about the unique aesthetic of this region 's coastline . "  
But the fact that the Chungho cases were all concentrated in a specific area ( around the small mountain behind Le Tien Temple and a few areas of similar topography ) means that the vectors have set down very firm roots in this city in northern Taiwan , creating what is defined as a " local epidemic . "  
Paul Perng says it used to be thought that clear targets were needed to bring about ecological protection , and so preservation areas were created for specific animals , such as the clouded leopard or panda . But in the future nature reserves wo n't be devoted to a single rare species but rather will be aimed at protecting the greatest diversity of ecology . Even areas that appear to contain nothing special but are nonetheless ecologically important will require protection .  
The Lausanne competitiveness assessment is divided into eight evaluations , covering 225 separate items . Taiwan performed least satisfactorily in terms of financial capability , degree of internationalization , and basic infrastructure . Taiwan finished 35th or lower in a number of specific items - - openness of capital markets , modernization of financial laws and regulations , internal trade , national protectionism , and immigration law .  
After a trip abroad , he discovered that Chinese Muslims had little understanding of their own religion 's doctrines , and were in dire need of an accurate Qur'an and other materials for interpreting it . He thus spent more than 20 years translating three Chinese texts altogether : one in classical Chinese , one in jingtangwen ( an old form with specific religious terms left in their original form , that is , not translated into a common equivalent ) , and one in the vernacular .  
The main source of purchased ships and naval weaponry has always been the US . But the US , which has a global strategy and huge forces , has designed its ships to specialize in specific missions like air defense or ASW . For the ROC navy , which has far fewer ships and a smaller area of responsibility , highly specialized craft are not necessarily suitable . That is to say , even if Taiwan can procure US ships , it may be necessary to refit or supplement the weaponry .  
An official at the Council of Agriculture , the governing body for wildlife protection , notes that " the Wildlife Conservation Law was targeted at the needs of a specific moment . All law is open to change , and in the future we might permit planned hunting , and also trade in game . " Today 's comprehensive ban on using natural resources does not meet the needs of the current environment , nor do the arguments behind the ban convince those worried about the survival of aboriginal culture .  
The abstract proofs of geometry all refer to concrete geometric reality , such as the proof that shows that " the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal . " If the teachers put out a little extra effort , then by rights students in seventh and eighth grade should all have experience making measurements with specific examples .  
For example , traditionally most museums have had permanent collections built around a specific theme . But very often their artifacts are far removed from their places of origin , cutting off their connection to their original environment , thereby obscuring much of their contextual meaning .  
" Maybe the conditions for seed germination are very specific and furthermore , they are unknown , " says Jose Luis Leon de la Luz , a botanist affiliated with the CIB . No matter how the plant manages to pass through the eons , its natural proliferation is not sufficient to sustain massive cutting for a hungry market . One fact should be borne in mind : If damiana products are to be used in large quantities , damiana plants should be plentiful .  
Once a week we worked on a specific topic assigned by Marian . We did role playing ( bought and sold stocks , for example ) , prepared a newspaper column , visited a local junior college , and picked wild strawberries . We even carried out a mock American-style election by printing out election ballots . Marian brought her shower curtain from home to set up a voting booth in the classroom .  
When animal protection has to be implemented in specific legal regulations the assistance of scientific research is usually required , so that concepts such as cruelty and pain are no longer vague or left to the kind of subjective judgements to which Zhuangzi retorted " I am not a fish-how can I know a fish 's suffering ? " Science also allows appropriate protective rules to be drafted according to the specific needs of different animals .  
From the time of Emperor Wu Di onwards , in the middle period of the Western Han dynasty , the government and people really began to focus on developing education . The rank of " Doctor of the Five Classics " was created , a purely academic post that involved historical and political research but had no specific political functions . As time went on , however , incumbents of the post began to be drawn into administrative matters and take on a political role .  
I would like to increase public investment in scientific and technological research , education , and vocational training . We need to develop local industries with growth potential and increase local employment opportunities in specific areas , in order to reverse the widening gap between rich and poor , and to maintain Taiwan 's competitiveness amidst globalization .  
They often pop up in rice paddies , and the toad-which because of the keratinization of its skin is at home away from the water-is also a frequent visitor to inhabited areas . But other species are confined to specific areas or are only active in particular seasons . So unless you traipse across countless rivers and endless mountains , you are n't likely to ever see them in their natural state .  
He further indicated that he has instructed all security organs that they " are not to carry out surveillance against specific political parties or individuals . " At the same time , said the president , these organs must be diligent in all matters related to national security , economic security , major criminal activity , maintenance of social order , and any other matters that fall within their legal jurisdiction .  
With their powerful wings , insects of the order Odonata can spread far and wide . Hence , compared with other insects , which have differentiated in response to specific environments , the proportion of endemic species among Taiwan 's dragonflies is not high . The island has only a third as many dragonfly species as butterfly species , and most were recorded by the middle of the 20th century . Lively dragonflies are easy to spot , but observing their lives in detail is more difficult .  
Given these various considerations , the nature of protecting nature is changing . " developed countries should help poor countries undertake resource protection , with all relevant departments participating , and get away from the old approach of focusing on specific animals . " This is the only way to ensure sustainable use and equitable distribution of resources .  
In Taiwan , there is no integration among the academic disciplines of zoology , botany , marine life , climate , soil conservation , and the like . Environmental protection agencies are weak , and research funding is limited . Thus there is little concrete knowledge about the numbers of various species and whether these numbers are rising or falling , not to mention any understanding of what concrete steps can be taken to solve specific problems .  
When applied to oceanography , the natural sound waves produced by the wind and currents create ambient noise , which is comparable to ambient light . An underwater target will perturb this ambient noise to produce " noisy " signals , just as ambient light reflects off objects in a room . Even though the ambient noise does not come from a specific source as in conventional sonar imaging , it can still " illuminate " objects .  
On a more concrete level , points of consensus included : Mainland investment policy will be guided by the principle " proactive opening , effective supervision . " This marks the end of the era of " no haste , be patient . " In the future , a schedule will be established for allowing investment in mainland China for specific sectors and products .  
I was still somewhat ambivalent about the whole affair , for I had n't any idea of what it meant to be a volunteer overseas . Later on I received notification to go to Taipei for language and aptitude tests . After passing the first round of tests , I was then notified about oral examinations . The oral exams were divided into three segments : a specific exam , a language exam , and an interview with ICDF staff members .  
According to a handbook entitled Medical Disputes Q &amp; A compiled by the Taiwan Health Reform Foundation , the types of redress most patients and their families wish for are : a reasonable explanation ; a sincere apology from the hospital and doctors ; financial responsibility to be taken for the continuing medical care of the patient ; hospitals and doctors to learn lessons ; proposals for specific reform measures ; action to prevent similar mistakes happening again ; substantive punishment for wrongdoers ; reasonable monetary damages or compensation ; and only last of all , criminal penalties .  
It will still take a long time to establish just what specific curative effects alternative therapies have . But since the former Office of Alternative Medicine at the US National Institutes of Health was expanded into a " national center " in 1998 , its annual research budget has grown hugely , from US $ 2 million then to US $ 150 million today .  
The draft bill included specific provisions defining political contributions as the outright gift of personal property or real estate , or the provision of other economic benefits , to a person or group participating in an election campaign or otherwise engaged in political activities .  
Although the rapid expansion of senior technical and vocational education has been able to meet student demand for degrees , another problem has arisen . With the rapid transformation of Taiwan 's industrial structure , there has been an increase in demand for individuals with specific skills . Vocational education now faces the problem of providing people with skills for which there is insufficient market demand . Supply and demand imbalance  
Fortunately , after a decade of fighting the good fight , the kinds of books for women now available in mainstream bookstores are no longer limited to childcare and cooking . Moreover , now that there are so many venues for artistic and intellectual events , Fembooks is no longer indispensable for the spread of the ideas and creative work that it has long promoted . It seems that the bookshop 's mission , particular to its specific time and place in the history of feminism in Taiwan , has been accomplished .  
Tang says that in college , most of his classmates were immersed in leftist thinking for a long time , and generally identified with the more " progressive " political party . But since the DPP won the presidential election in 2000 , the nature of politics has changed , and people have scattered among the various political parties . Policy has become more important than party identification , and different people work for different parties often just because they support some very specific policies of a given party .  
The changing face of the Yushan area at the hands of human beings over the last hundred years is quite clear . Although since the Japanese occupation Yushan has satisfied the so-called spiritual needs and intellectual inquiries of scholars from various disciplines , this has generally been for the one-sided benefit of mankind , done with a specific purpose in mind . And this includes the so-called " spirit of Yushan " today , which is a product of mankind 's subjective emotional projection .  
FRTRI director Liu Pao-pao , who has designed rock-climbing shoes and medical footwear for the elderly , says , " If we had presented medical footwear for specific professions or elderly people to the public ten years ago , we would not have been able to sell them . But Taiwan has entered the modern age . These days , people are much more health conscious and are willing to spend money to take care of themselves .

We believe that , without prejudice to the current institutional arrangements of duration and venue of the substantive session , consideration could be given to regularizing the holding of short sessions throughout the year , in accordance with the Charter 's provisions relative to the Council , including sessions to address critical developments and / or specific issues in the economic , social , environmental and human rights fields .  
In this spirit , before I described some specific reform recommendations my delegation is advancing in connection with the current agenda item , it would be helpful to the Assembly 's consideration of these ideas for me to preface them with four essential points : the diagnostic framework ; the historical context ; and the premises and the paramount objective that underlie our proposals .  
In the light of the urgency of the need to find timely and effective approaches for addressing the issue , the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of Bulgaria , Greece , Moldova , Romania and Ukraine came forward with a set of specific proposals in a joint letter to the Secretary-General of 18 May 1995 , circulated as an official United Nations document ( A / 50 / 189 ) .

It is a fact that we have made a rather substantial advance in our thinking on specific disarmament issues and that we have moved across the dangerous line of confrontation towards a more complex labyrinth in which the options for greater progress are broad and open .  
Depending upon circumstances , it should be comprehensive or specific , global or regional , unilateral , bilateral or multilateral , separate or interconnected , step-by-step but part of a grand strategy always mutually complementary pieces of one mosaic .  
These were conspicuous by the lack of specific commitments concerning : an end to the qualitative aspects of nuclear armaments ; the process of nuclear disarmament within a time-bound framework and under multilateral auspices ; assurances of the orderly flow of technology for developing countries ; and the right of non-nuclear States to credible , unconditional and legally binding security assurances .  
Particular attention should be given to specific groups of youth in distressed circumstances , including indigenous , migrant and refugee youth , displaced persons , street children and poor youth in urban and rural areas , as well as to special problems , including literacy problems , for blind youth and youth with other disabilities .

The aim is twofold : to maximize the impact of development cooperation by taking advantage of an effective division of labour and of the specific areas of competence of the various partners ( governmental , non-governmental , private sector , multilateral , bilateral ) ; and to ensure a greater level of national and local participation in and ownership of population and development programmes .  
In specific cases , the inclusion of special modules has been accompanied by the redesign of the basic questionnaire or at least parts of it , with the objective of continuing to adapt to changing conditions by incorporating improved techniques of research , and of perfecting the investigation of specific variables .  
The representative replied that the mechanisms were focal points for rural development , education and popular participation , a few committees dealing with specific issues , various other connections at the societal and international levels and that the National Secretariat was represented in seven out of the nine provinces of the country .  
Asked about the specific content of the equality clause in the National Population Law and whether recourse was available in the event that national equality legislation was not applied at the local level , the representative said that the National Population Law established equality between men and women where family planning was concerned and provided recourse to courts .  
Taking into account the positive developments in the process , which to some extent allay the concerns of the Council as expressed in its resolution 966 ( 1994 ) , my Government considers that the conditions have been created for the speedy constitution of a UNAVEM III with a specific mandate as set forth in the Lusaka Protocol , including technical , material and human resources sufficient for it to carry out its mandate .  
The three main objectives of the conference would be ( a ) to mobilize a political and economic " mountain lobby " capable of demonstrating to Governments , policy makers and planners the potential contribution of mountain areas to national and regional development ; ( b ) to introduce the financial and planning instruments needed to incorporate mountain development into national plans and budgets ; and ( c ) to examine the specific human , social and technological characteristics of mountain areas .

To put those constitutional principles into effect , a vast national mechanism had been established , which had made it possible to predict and , to some degree , alleviate the negative consequences on women of the economic crisis , to include gender factors in State social policy and to take specific measures aimed at facilitating women 's adaptation to the market economy .  
Another representative also expressed her preference for a permanent body working on a full-time basis , given the nature , complexity and specific activities of the Court as well as the increasing number of cases that might come under its jurisdiction , but nevertheless supported a more flexible solution , bearing in mind the possible economic and practical difficulties involved .  
One representative expressed surprise at the absence of any reference in article 33 to other sources of substantive international law , and suggested that it be redrafted to broaden the range of applicable rules , so that over and above the statute , the Court could apply the draft Code , treaties relating to certain specific crimes , principles and rules of international law , the relevant acts of international organizations and , if necessary , any rule of national law .  
The above notwithstanding , the wording of subparagraph ( c ) providing that the Court should apply " to the extent applicable , any rule of national law " was considered as too vague by some representatives , who called for more specific language bearing in mind that international law did not yet contain a complete statement of substantive and procedural criminal law . 
They also welcomed the fact that the draft articles provided explicit rules under which watercourse States were entitled to enter into bilateral or multilateral agreements , tailored to their specific needs , provided that they respected the general principles set forth in the articles .  
One representative expressed the view that , from the standpoint of terminology , it would be advisable to highlight the difference between contiguous or adjacent and successive watercourses , as each system had its own specific features , and that a particular rule could not be assumed to be applicable to both types of watercourses .  
One representative stated that , according to paragraph ( 2 ) of the commentary to draft article 3 , the Commission expressly recognized that optimal utilization , protection and development of a specific international watercourse were best achieved through an agreement tailored to the characteristics of that watercourse and to the needs of the States concerned .  
The economic and social assistance rendered by the specialized agencies and international institutions of the United Nations system should be increased and redesigned to create special programmes of assistance to those Territories , bearing in mind their specific characteristics , such as their small areas and populations , their remoteness , their limited resources and internal markets , their dependence on imports , and their vulnerability to natural disasters and environmental hazards .  
The Mission recommends that criminal legislation should be amended so as to incorporate in it a specific description of the crime of torture , making it punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account its grave nature , as required in the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment , which has been ratified by Guatemala .  
The comprehensive agreement is the only agreement that has been in full force and subject to specific verification for almost a year now , yet the current status of compliance with it - the practical expression of which would be a marked improvement in respect for human rights in Guatemala - stands in stark contrast to and falls far short of what was agreed .  
The Commission may wish to address appropriate measures to increasing financing for priority actions at the national level related to science for sustainable development , in particular scientific capacity-building in developing countries , and to formulate recommendations addressed to multilateral and bilateral donor agencies and Governments , as well as specific funding mechanisms , such as the Global Environment Facility ( GEF ) .  
However , there are several emerging interdisciplinary subject areas that are not yet adequately addressed by specific scientific programmes at the international level .  
Deeply concerned about the recurring violations of human rights specific to or primarily directed against women by some members of warring factions in Afghanistan , and about the lack of respect towards them and their physical integrity and dignity , as reported by the Special Rapporteur ,  
In carrying out these functions , the subsidiary bodies may be assisted , in accordance with rule 27 of the rules of procedure , by such intergovernmental [ 8 ] / technical advisory panels as are deemed necessary , in particular to provide scientific and technological advice including on related economic aspects and on specific practices ;  
In 1994 , the Earthwatch secretariat observed that one of the major problems with environmental assessment is the lack of adequate and specific information about many aspects of our environment and of human pressures on it , and in particular the enormous gap in information on many developing countries and regions , which produces a bias in assessments towards the industrialized countries .  
Condemns also the specific violations identified by the Special Rapporteur , most of which are committed in connection with ethnic cleansing by Bosnian Serbs , and which include killings , torture , beatings , arbitrary searches , rape , disappearances , destruction of houses , forced and illegal evictions , detentions and other acts or threats of violence aimed at forcing individuals to leave their homes ;  
The major areas identified in the Plan are human rights and the promotion of equality ; employment promotion including improving the situation of women in the labour market , women workers in the formal and informal sectors ; training ; working conditions and environment ; social security ; labour legislation , labour relations , labour administration , workers ' and employers ' activities ; women in specific industrial sectors ; and in the different regions .  
The notion of " economic integration " in fact implies specific and obvious political and legal consequences , particularly when it is linked to the continuation of the military occupation and the total political dependence of the Cypriot territories in question on Ankara .  
As to how the specific nature of the Model Law should be reflected in the draft Guide , it was agreed that clear indication should be given that the Model Law was intended to constitute a discrete and balanced set of rules , all of which should be enacted by implementing States in order to meet the objectives of the Model Law .  
In countries like Norway and the Netherlands , among others , Governments also conduct direct negotiations with major stakeholders so that voluntary agreements could be concluded between parties concerned to meet specific environmental targets .

Portugal 's domestic legislation provided for the criminal responsibility of legal persons , including that of the State , and there were merits in developing the concept of international criminal responsibility , but the draft articles did not include specific consequences attached to a crime as opposed to a mere wrongful act .  
Several options may be considered , such as : ( a ) encouraging governments to provide greater support to national , regional and international institutions ; ( b ) requesting the governing bodies of international organizations to give a high priority to work in support of the UNFCCC process ; ( c ) revising the guidance to the GEF so as to encourage support for specific methodological issues ; and ( d ) providing for additions to the secretariat budget and / or contributions to the supplementary fund for the period 1998-1999 .  
Lastly , the aim should be to elaborate a framework convention enacting the basic principles and setting forth the conceptual basis for eventual bilateral or regional arrangements regarding specific watercourses to be concluded between the watercourse States concerned , taking into account their respective characteristics .  
In considering applications on a case-by-case basis , the Committee viewed as inappropriate requests to supply industrial equipment and raw materials , as well as horticultural produce , except fruits and vegetables , to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , unless such applications contained , in every case , specific explanations of how the commodities and products in question were intended to meet essential humanitarian needs ( see press release SC / 6118 ) .  
In August 1993 , it approved a proposal presented by SAMCOMM , following a meeting of riparian States in Bucharest , that vessels , both powered or non-powered , which carried no goods or commodities , excluding packing material intended for reuse ( empty reels , pallets , etc . ) , could transit without specific prior authorization of the Committee , provided that all movements were notified to the SAMs teams by shipping operators and that the vessels were subject to monitoring before entry to and exit from the Danube portion between Vidin / Calafat and Mohacs .  
The Committee advised applicant States wishing to undertake energy-related exports to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia for humanitarian purposes , that it was not in a position to approve the supply of energy-related products to the country for general distribution ; however , without prejudice to its final decision , the Committee expressed readiness to consider requests for authorization of shipments of strictly limited quantities of fuel targeting specific end-users among the most vulnerable groups of civilian population and for purely humanitarian purposes .  
Invites Governments , in accordance with the commitments made at the World Summit for Social Development held at Copenhagen in March 1995 , [ 14 ] / to set specific target dates for eliminating all forms of child labour that are contrary to accepted international standards and ensuring the full enforcement of relevant existing laws and , where appropriate , enacting the legislation necessary to implement obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and International Labour Organization standards ensuring the protection of working children ;  
Please indicate the specific measures adopted to reduce economic , social and geographical disparities , including between rural and urban areas , to prevent discrimination against the most disadvantaged groups of children , including children belonging to minorities or indigenous communities , disabled children , children born out of wedlock , children who are non-nationals , migrants , displaced , refugees or asylum _ seekers , and children who are living and / or working on the streets .  
Please describe specific measures taken to guarantee the child 's right to life and to create an environment conducive to ensuring to the maximum extent possible the survival and development of the child , including physical , mental , spiritual , moral , psychological and social development , in a manner compatible with human dignity , and to prepare the child for an individual life in a free society .  
In the economic and social sectors , services of gratis personnel have been contributed by Governments and institutes to assist in carrying out work at Headquarters , primarily in areas where specific expertise was required to assist the Secretariat , for example , national accounts , research and analysis of the world economic and social situation , development of indicators of sustainable development and monitoring programmes of action and other international instruments in the economic and social sectors .  
Recalling the importance of preserving the independence of the Secretariat , the Open-ended High-level Working Group on the Strengthening of the United Nations System , in its report to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session ( A / 50 / 24 ) , stated that positions funded from extrabudgetary resources or personnel on loan from Member States were only acceptable on a temporary basis for specific short-term projects or pending a transition , which should be accomplished promptly , to budgetary posts funded from assessed contributions .  
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Invites Governments , in accordance with the commitments made at the World Summit for Social Development held at Copenhagen in March 1995 , [ 30 ] to set specific target dates for eliminating all forms of child labour that are contrary to accepted international standards and ensuring the full enforcement of relevant existing laws and , where appropriate , enacting the legislation necessary to implement obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child16 and International Labour Organization standards ensuring the protection of working children ;  
Recommends also that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development , and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
Referring to the addendum to the LDCs 1996 Report , which addressed the important issue of strengthening the LDCs ' capacity for participation in the multilateral trading system and identified specific programmes that could ease the economic adjustment burden on the LDCs , he looked forward to a useful discussion on that issue and hoped that it would result in timely inputs to the initiative currently under way in the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) which would be submitted to the Singapore Ministerial Meeting .  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education ;  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
" Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate that our country is prepared to provide , on specific terms , special units of its military forces for demining operations conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and other international organizations , or on a bilateral basis .  A mine-clearance training centre , established in the city of Kamyanets-Podilsky , provides all the facilities necessary to train foreign specialists in this field .  
Nevertheless , the legal institution of reservations may well have to be reassessed in the light of the particular nature of human rights treaties ; this results from their specific object , which is to provide maximum protection for individuals victimized not only by their own Governments but also at the hands of private parties , from their recognition in international and regional jurisprudence as establishing non-reciprocal and objective obligations , and from the existence of treaty monitoring bodies .  
Calls upon the international community to apply , where necessary , the principle of common but differentiated responsibility in ongoing international cooperation on the protection of the environment and in efforts to implement existing instruments of international environmental law and the elaboration of new instruments , and to continue to take fully into account specific circumstances and requirements , in particular , those of developing countries and countries with economies in transition , thus facilitating their compliance with their obligations under international agreements ;  
In that connection , bearing in mind that the draft Code and the international criminal court would form part of a single international legal regime , he hoped that the court 's statute would provide more specific guidance on issues which were not clearly defined in , or omitted from , the draft Code .  
BAKER ( Israel ) shared the view expressed by the Commission as to the difficulty of distinguishing between codification and progressive development of international law , especially in an era in which the development of international law took place in specialized spheres through the activities of various institutions , the regionalization of the handling of specific issues and an increase in law-making bodies , whether private or official , formal or informal .  
This finding was based on an extensive discussion of Mali 's recent history , led and informed by two Ministers from that country who described their Government 's determination to involve all segments of the population in the peace process , to recognize the specific development needs of the north , to reintegrate former combatants into civil society , to help resettle refugees and to provide a secure environment conducive to disarmament .  
Invites the executive heads of the organizations of the common system to develop and submit proposals , as a matter of priority , to their relevant intergovernmental bodies on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , these proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General ;  
Requests the Commission to take the lead in analysing new approaches in the human resources management field so as to develop standards , methods and arrangements that will respond to the specific needs , especially regarding future staffing , of the organizations of the common system including , inter alia , consideration of flexible contractual arrangements , performance-based pay and the introduction of special occupational pay rates , and to report to the General Assembly thereon at its fifty-third session .  Replace the tables in paragraph ( b ) ( i ) by the following :  
Invites the executive heads of the organizations of the common system to develop and submit proposals , as a matter of priority , to their relevant intergovernmental bodies on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , these proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General ;  
Requests the Commission to take the lead in analysing new approaches in the human resources management field so as to develop standards , methods and arrangements that will respond to the specific needs , especially regarding future staffing , of the organizations of the common system , including , inter alia , consideration of flexible contractual arrangements , performance-based pay and the introduction of special occupational pay rates , and to report to the General Assembly thereon at its fifty-third session . 
In conformity with paragraph 11 ( a ) of its revised methods of work ( see annex I ) , the Working Group , without in any way prejudging the final assessment of whether the detention was arbitrary or not , drew the attention of each of the Governments concerned to the specific case as reported and appealed to it to take the necessary measures to ensure that the detained persons ' right to life and to physical integrity was respected .  
There should be a specific provision in the operative part of the statute devoted to the principle of complementarity which would define the nature and scope of cooperation between the court and national judicial systems , and the obligation of States parties to cooperate with the court in an effective and speedy manner .  
At later stages of planning , the Secretariat will require more detailed information , such as the response time for each individual unit , any political or material preconditions , period of self-sufficiency , level of equipment , probable port of departure , total surface / volume / weight , number and types of vehicles , number of containers , information on particularly large or heavy items , and information on dangerous cargo ( e.g . , ammunition ) , and any specific handling instructions .  
Any specific agreements should take into account the special geographic , climatic , historical and hydrological characteristics of a given river , as well as previous bilateral and multilateral agreements and the customary uses of its water resources .  
Conscious of the human rights and dignity of all refugee children and adolescents and that , due to their specific needs and vulnerability within the broader refugee population , they need to be among the first to receive protection and assistance in any refugee situation , Gravely concerned that refugee children and adolescents continue to be exposed to family separation , physical violence and other violations of their human rights , including through sexual abuse and exploitation , and military or armed attacks ,  
It was pointed out that in some jurisdictions the relief that could be granted by the court before the opening of insolvency proceedings or before recognition of a foreign proceeding was limited to relief measures of an individual nature provided under national rules on civil procedure ( i.e . measures covering specific assets identified by a creditor ) and did not extend to special relief measures available under special rules concerning collective insolvency proceedings .  
Emphasizing the importance of the democratic , efficient , transparent and representative governing structures of the United Nations Environment Programme , with a complementary , specific and distinct role and mandate for each of their components ,  
The international community must take specific measures designed to act on the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice on the obligation to pursue and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament under strict and effective international control .  
I believe that it is possible to plan a special session that would be different from the routine , one that would focus on adopting a considerable number of major initiatives to implement the outcome of the Summit action-oriented initiatives , and initiatives of implementation and on negotiations not on texts but on specific action at the national , regional and international levels .  
We do not wish these meetings to be transformed into routine or symbolic occasions , but to become a forum for candid and transparent discussions on all issues related to specific troops participating in peacekeeping operations .  
The fact that we have been able to emerge with dignity from the most critical phase in our independent development is , to a large extent , to the credit of the United Nations and its specialized agencies , which provided Georgia not only with moral support but with specific and timely financial and technical assistance . 
We must see to it that these trends are strengthened and that the way is cleared for specific , tangible steps that would make it possible to move to address in practical terms the question of the cessation of the armed conflict and the start of a political dialogue aimed at national reconciliation and the establishment in Afghanistan of a broad-based , fully representative government .  
But the main specific feature is that all these Republics are in the process of building a State , and therefore give the highest priority to the issues of peace , security and stability in their domestic and foreign policies , because only with these basic conditions is sustainable economic and social development possible .  
You have moved forward in several areas , such as the management of forests and fresh water , in the commitment to discuss energy and transport from the perspective of sustainable development and in more specific actions , such as the phasing out of leaded gasoline and the ambitious work programme you have set for the Commission on Sustainable Development .  
The latter includes : ( i ) general actions related to shelter , services and settlement-wide issues ; ( ii ) actions for families in especially difficult circumstances ( including those in critical housing conditions , the homeless , female headed households and evicted families ) ; and ( iii ) specific actions for children ( mainly children in especially difficult circumstances ) .  
The four specific action areas laid out in the mission statement - operational assistance , advancement of understanding of the issues , encouragement of social and economic development through migration , and upholding the human dignity and well-being of migrants - permeate the Programme of Action , too , and provide a solid basis for IOM 's institutional commitment to moving the international consensus reached at the International Conference on Population and Development towards concrete action .  
Since 1977 , in the light of the considerable increase in the number of children having to begin a form of education completely different from that of their country of origin and unrelated to their native language , and in the middle of the school year , special primary classes have been set up to smooth their transition and a specific teaching method developed to help them learn French quickly . 
These human rights are reinforced by the principles of participatory democracy , which assumes the involvement of PLHAs and their families , women , children and groups vulnerable to HIV / AIDS in designing and implementing programmes that will be most effective by being tailored to the specific needs of these groups .  
In a democratic society , the typical functions of the armed forces relate to the defence of sovereignty and territorial integrity ; any other function is atypical and exceptional ; like any other government institution , their exercise of other functions must take place in a context of subordination to lawfully constituted authority and be preceded by a decision of and be monitored by the lawfully constituted authorities of the State within their specific sphere of competence . 
The level of electoral participation is the result of many different social and political factors , including the impact of civil institutions on the daily lives of Guatemalans , the capacity of political parties to fulfil people 's expectations , the degree of organized participation by citizens in social and political life and their level of civic education , all of which are elements which the package of peace agreements already signed seeks to strengthen .  The electoral process is marred by specific shortcomings which impede the effective enjoyment of the right to vote .  
In respect of persons who were involved in the internal armed conflict owing to institutional mandates , the National Reconciliation Act shall contain specific provisions equivalent to those previously mentioned , in that they shall extinguish criminal liability for common crimes perpetrated with the aim of preventing , thwarting , suppressing or punishing the commission of political crimes and related common crimes , where such crimes were directly , objectively , intentionally and causally related to that aim , unless it is demonstrated that there is no relationship between the criminal act and the stated aim .  
In order to gather specific information on preparations for the Year , United Nations Member States , United Nations bodies and specialized agencies , and selected non-governmental organizations were requested to provide information on the establishment of focal points for the Year and designate priorities for their preparatory activities within the four dimensions of the conceptual framework for the Year .  
It was envisaged that implementation of Agenda 21 would require active involvement of all relevant international institutions , both within and outside the United Nations system , that are dealing with specific economic , social or environmental dimensions of sustainable development .  
Moreover , analysis of trafficking trends and of conclusions thereon , as well as of specific trafficking routes and methods , is often incomplete as a result of the scarcity of individual seizure reports transmitted by Governments to international organizations and the relatively low rates of interception of illicit drug trafficking in some of the key trafficking countries and regions .  
Furthermore , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
In possession of considerable information relating to alleged serious violations of human rights in Nigeria , and in the absence either of a substantive response from the Government concerning specific allegations transmitted during the year or of the opportunity to visit the country , the Special Rapporteurs were thus required at least to inform the General Assembly about the substance of allegations received and to draw such preliminary conclusions as may be possible by reference to , e.g . , declared laws and acknowledged practices .  
With a view to finding durable and concrete solutions to the problem of the sale and commercial sexual exploitation of children , the Special Rapporteur is making an urgent appeal to Governments , non-governmental organizations , and all concerned agencies and individuals , to keep her informed on a regular and sustained basis of developments in matters under her mandate , including specific situations of child abuse in any country .  
In its response , UNICEF referred to the report prepared by the expert of the Secretary-General , Ms . Gra \ x { 84f7 } Michel , on the impact of armed conflict on children , submitted pursuant to General Assembly resolution 48 / 157 ( see A / 51 / 306 and Add . 1 ) .  Although the report gives extensive information on violations of the rights of women and children , it does not provide specific information pertinent to the release of women and children taken hostage in armed conflict and imprisoned .  
Also recommends that the causes of poverty be addressed in the context of sectoral strategies such as those on environment , food security , population , migration , health , shelter , human resources development , fresh water , including clean water and sanitation , rural development and productive employment , and by addressing the specific needs of vulnerable groups , all of which should aim at the social and economic integration of people living in poverty ;  
In this connection , the Parsi minority is one of the most active and prosperous in India , both in the economic field as well as in terms of private school establishments , and also one of those that attaches the greatest importance to maintaining itself as a specific and distinct ethnic and religious community .  
As cholera is now thought to be endemic in Somalia , agencies , having learned from four years of experience , have designed specific prevention and control plans with the local communities to ensure water chlorination and to prevent the spread of the disease through social mobilization campaigns on country-wide radio broadcasts , local billboards , flyers and messages delivered through religious leaders .  
The General Assembly in its resolution 51 / 64 , section IV , decided to convene , for three days in June 1998 , a special session in order to consider the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities , and to propose new strategies , methods , practical activities and specific measures to strengthen international cooperation in addressing the problem of illicit drugs .  
The General Assembly , in its resolution 51 / 64 , section IV , decided to convene a special session in order to consider the fight against the illicit production , sale , demand , traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities and to propose new strategies , methods , practical activities and specific measures to strengthen international cooperation in addressing the problem of illicit drugs .  
The team 's examination of the UNEP organizational chart ( see appendix ) and related material defining functional responsibilities , suggests that the functions and authorities are broadly defined at the divisional level but less so at the subdivisional level , where clusters of staff form key groups responsible for specific functions within the overall responsibility of a division . 
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Accordingly , and as long as the faction leaders , the militias and other irregular armed forces continue their conflict in Somalia and until a peaceful settlement is reached , international humanitarian law related to internal armed conflict applies in the whole territory of Somalia irrespective of whether the specific area is engulfed in active fighting .  
Using all preventive , educational , medical and legal information available , such programmes should raise the awareness of youth of the negative consequences of drug abuse and should be tailored individually to target specific groups of potential young abusers ;  
On the basis of a set of background documents and a compendium of summarized project proposals the informal consultative group stressed the importance of crime prevention and criminal justice in development , analysed the role of the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Programme , its comparative advantages and potential , and recommended specific modalities of resource mobilization , after having reviewed national policies and practices relating to development-assistance funding .  
It was also agreed as to a more precise mandate for the Working Group that the uniform rules to be prepared should deal with such issues as : the legal basis supporting certification processes , including emerging digital authentication and certification technology ; the applicability of the certification process ; the allocation of risk and liabilities of users , providers and third parties in the context of the use of certification techniques ; the specific issues of certification through the use of registries ; and incorporation by reference .  
However , one of the difficulties of undertaking work in the area of electronic signatures stemmed from the fact that , if the uniform rules to be prepared were to provide the level of guidance that might be required to implement the principles embodied in article 7 of the Model Law , they might have to deviate from a purely functional approach , and to address in some detail the manner in which specific techniques could perform the above-mentioned functions .  
If such an approach was to be adopted , the following alternatives could be considered : to leave it for national conflict-of-laws rules to determine the law applicable to the questions of liability and damages ; to draft a specific uniform conflict-of-laws rule ; or to determine directly which conflict-of-laws rule should be applied ( e.g . , the conflict-of-laws rule of the country in which the certification authority was registered or otherwise authorized to do business ) .  
As agricultural commodities continued to play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries , there was a continuing need to increase market transparency , to improve the transmission of price signals , to seek consensus among exporters and importers on policies , to pursue commodity development activities , to address environmental concerns in specific commodities and to seek WTO compatible means to handle commodity price instability .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Successful efforts have been made to sensitize public opinion and to mobilize international cooperation , as well as to adopt specific programmes to implement Agenda 21 and to establish relevant institutional mechanisms at the international , regional , national and local levels . 
That framework was built on an innovative model that combined central coordination functions , vested in the mandates of the Administrative Committee on Coordination and the newly established Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , and decentralized allocation of specific responsibilities to relevant organizations of the United Nations system , based on their comparative strengths , to act as task managers for various programme components of Agenda 21 .  
Even though there was no specific mention to this effect in the response received from the Netherlands , it is known that the country , along with other developed countries , such as Japan , participates in triangular arrangements , whereby the services of suitable developing countries are utilized to deliver a technical cooperation input to another developing country .  
In paragraph 11 of General Assembly resolution 50 / 97 , the Secretary-General is requested to convene another meeting of governmental experts from land-locked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions , including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions , to review progress in the development of transit systems in the land-locked and transit developing countries with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating specific action-oriented measures [ 1 ] .  
Detailed and specific projects for each of the eight countries , focused on a combination of training and supportive measures to strengthen supply capabilities based on the needs already identified , have been prepared for each country and currently await formal approval from the country authorities concerned .  
Notes that the prevention of mass exoduses requires lasting and effective solutions and requires bilateral and multilateral efforts with specific commitments and effective contributions to developing countries in order to promote the realization of all human rights , in particular the right to development , and welcomes in this regard the holistic approach to promotion and protection of human rights adopted by the High Commissioner .  
Also , more effective use will be made of policy seminars , conferences and training workshops addressed to specific development issues , bringing together senior national policy makers and representatives of civil society and the private sector and facilitating a shared understanding of the development challenges that African countries face and the policy options that are available .  
The Sub-Commission , at its forty-eighth session , in its resolution 1996 / 30 , requested the Special Rapporteur to update the list of States which have proclaimed , extended or terminated a state of emergency with a view to its consideration by the Sub _ Commission at its forty _ ninth session , and requested him to submit final conclusions on the protection of human rights during states of emergency , together with specific recommendations as to how this question should be dealt with in the future .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
The Special Rapporteur suggests that special rapporteurs and working groups pay particular attention to the impact of emergency situations on the specific area covered by their respective mandates and that , as the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has repeatedly stated , they should avail themselves of the valuable collaboration which the Special Rapporteur on human rights and states of emergency would be able to provide , in the event that such a Special Rapporteur were to be appointed by the Commission . 
Thus the topic will be limited only to codification of secondary rules on the subject : while addressing the requirement of a violation of an international obligation of the State as a prerequisite , it will not address the specific content of those international legal obligations , whether under customary or treaty law .  
The expected outcome of the Conference is a Lisbon Declaration on Youth Policies and Programmes by ministers responsible for youth to further promote the World Programme of Action for Youth to the Year 2000 and Beyond through more focused and specific intersectoral measures at the regional , national and local / municipal levels .  
Noting with concern the absence in the countries concerned of specific legislation to govern offences committed by minor children , the absence of preventive and educational measures for their reintegration into society which would enable minor detainees to become rehabilitated and no longer marginalized , as well as the very limited number of children 's magistrates capable of understanding the problems of delinquent children and seeing that they are cared for ,  
Recalling that in the same resolution the Commission called upon the Sub _ Commission to focus on its primary role as an advisory body of the Commission , to facilitate efficient and effective participation of non _ governmental organizations , to devote sufficient time at its forty _ ninth session to the discussion of its working methods and to prepare specific recommendations on that issue for consideration by the Commission ,  
At the international level , the action plan defined a specific set of complementary actions designed to re-establish the necessary priority for improving agriculture and the rural economy , including two high-profile initiatives .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in these areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , on human health and on environmental protection for all countries , particularly developing countries .  
The emphasis given by the Commission on Sustainable Development at its fourth session to the importance of effective conservation and management of fish stocks , and in particular to eliminating overfishing , in order to identify specific steps at national or regional levels to prevent or eliminate excess fishing capacity , will need to be carried forward in all appropriate international forums including , in particular , the Committee on Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ;  
Countries need to systematically increase the use of renewable energy sources according to their specific social , economic , natural , geographical and climatic conditions and cleaner fuel technologies , including fossil fuel technologies , and to improve efficiency in energy production , distribution and use and in other industrial production processes that are intensive users of energy ;  
We believe that in thinking about the African future they would be well advised to build on well-tested solutions , enriched with their specific local experience and African traditions , bearing in mind that respect for universally recognized standards of democracy , the rule of law and basic human rights lies at the centre of contemporary international relations .  
The ties between the Russian Federation and Egypt that are developing in the economic , cultural , humanitarian and other spheres are based on mutual respect for the specific national and cultural characteristics of the two peoples and their traditions of friendship .  
The General Assembly also invited the executive heads of the organizations of the common system to develop and submit proposals , to their relevant intergovernmental bodies , as a matter of priority , on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , those proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General .  
They needed to be applied impartially , on the basis of specific criteria and a clear timetable , and only when there was a real threat to international peace and security .  The possibility of adopting smart sanctions , which would not affect innocent civilians or cause undue suffering , had been discussed .  
Further , the Assembly called upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the High Commissioner / Centre for Human Rights , in implementing the Plan of Action .  
As stated in earlier paragraphs , the Ministry of Culture and Education is taking steps under the Social Plan for Education on behalf of low _ income and rural sectors , indigenous communities , children with physical or mental disabilities and specific population groups with a view to ensuring that they may enter and stay in the educational system and strengthening the teaching function of schools by giving priority to strategies to improve in-house training and help eliminate educational inequalities .  
The problem of the widening industrialization and technology gap is acknowledged to be particularly acute in sub-Saharan Africa , with 33 of the world 's 48 least developed countries , while macroeconomic stabilization programmes have been adopted by most African countries since the early 1980s in an attempt to create an enabling environment for long-term growth , they have usually not included any specific measures to promote industrial development .  
UNCLOS is acknowledged to be an " umbrella convention " because most of its provisions , being of a general nature , can only be implemented through specific operative regulations to be contained in other international agreements or national law .  
United Nations treaty bodies , special rapporteurs , representatives and independent experts have regularly provided valuable information on specific human rights problems having the potential of generating mass exoduses or preventing their resolution , together with recommendations for corrective measures .  
The inter-agency consolidated appeals will reflect to a greater extent all operational activities performed by humanitarian agencies in specific situations and activities included in appeals will , pursuant to joint consultations , be listed in accordance with the priorities given .  
However , it is our opinion that in order to be successful , any transparency mechanism must be guided by certain specific principles , namely , it must be balanced , comprehensive , non-discriminatory , and fully enhance the national , regional and international security of all States according to the rules of international law .  
Even recent advances in the scientific understanding of these complex events leave much to speculation or , at best , any systematic patterns observed may be highly opportunistic to specific events or individual examples .  
The source reported that in late 1993 , the appeal division of the Supreme Court barred further habeas corpus applications and ruled that in light of the special circumstances and the seriousness of the crimes involved , the SPO detainees were to remain incarcerated without any specific time limit , until they were charged .  
There might , however , be specific situations in which the adoption of a separate competition policy would be accorded a lower priority : in some economies , particularly small economies , competition from imports and from foreign firms might be sufficient to minimize the possibilities for restrictive business practices by private firms , while in other economies , lack of resources and human resources for effective implementation of competition law might limit the ability to adopt a competition policy , at least in the immediate future .  
Success in the thematic area of gender will be measured by : ( a ) the extent to which a viable , common regional agenda is established in the area of leadership and women ; ( b ) the extent to which public awareness about violence against women is raised in specific target groups on violence ; ( c ) the extent to which mainstreaming tools are utilized by target groups and disseminated in the region .  
In performing that function , his mandate has crystallized into three main areas of work : ( a ) the development of an appropriate normative framework for meeting the protection and assistance needs of the internally displaced ; ( b ) the promotion of effective institutional arrangements for meeting those needs ; ( c ) focusing , through country visits , on specific situations of internal displacement that the representative , through dialogue with the Government and other actors concerned , aims to ensure are effectively addressed .  
The Inter-Agency Standing Committee equally will need to play a more active role in several respects : assessing the degree to which the needs of the internally displaced are being met by the United Nations system generally as well as in specific situations , calling upon other United Nations agencies to play strong supporting roles in the humanitarian effort , pressing for political action to resolve the crises that create humanitarian emergencies and drawing attention to situations that receive insufficient attention .  
In his reports to the Commission and the General Assembly , the representative has provided information on the magnitude of internal displacement worldwide , has identified specific needs of the internally displaced for protection and assistance , including highlighting the particular problems faced by women and children , has assessed the extent to which those needs are being met under existing normative and institutional frameworks and has reported in detail on specific country situations that he , through his country visits , has studied first-hand .  
Evaluating the extent to which international , regional and national responses address specific crises of internal displacement will be essential both for ensuring that specific situations are effectively addressed and for furthering the development of strategies at the regional and global levels .  
To the supplementary Ariane-5 programmes at rates ranging from 3 to 6 per cent according to the anticipated activities in these three programmes , with the aim of maintaining the high standard of the specific industrial capabilities established in Belgium since the 1970s and thus preserving their advantageous position in the industrial consortium marketing the launch vehicle .  
One delegation , also speaking on behalf of a large group , advanced some specific suggestions to the Task Force , among which was that the free flow of accurate and up-to-date information , taking into account the linguistic diversity of the Organization , must remain the primary function of the Department and that the dissemination of relevant information about the United Nations and its programmes should continue to be a core activity of the Department , particularly in developing countries .

In pursuing this objective , however , it must be remembered that the proceedings of intergovernmental organs and bodies make it imperative to research , write , edit , translate , print and distribute parliamentary documentation for meetings on specific dates , and almost always within short deadlines .  Fulfilling this requirement as efficiently as possible makes it necessary to give higher relative priority to the preparation and processing of documents than of publications , except those that are themselves required for meetings .  
Regarding the preparation of interdisciplinary / joint publications with other regional commissions or entities , the Economic Commission for Europe would suggest that three criteria be met : the decision should be taken on a voluntary basis by interested agencies ; the objective of the publication should be to provide a variety of views and experiences on specific issues ; and the time-frame for publications should be realistic and agreed upon by the organizations involved .  
Calls upon international , regional and national non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental organizations , in particular those concerned with women , labour , development , food , housing , education , health care and the environment , as well as all other social justice groups , human rights advocates , educators , religious organizations and the media , to undertake specific activities of formal , non-formal and informal education , including cultural events , alone and in cooperation with the Office of the High Commissioner , in implementing the Plan of Action ;  
Recognizing the need for fuller utilization of the material and intellectual potential of the two countries , the development of specific approaches and the creation of mechanisms to facilitate the attainment of practical goals in accordance with the new political , economic and social realities , Make the following declaration :  
The Commission recognizes the value of the recommendations made by the experts , and stresses the specific needs of developing countries , especially LDCs , regarding access to international networks in general and to electronic commerce in particular ; the development of physical infrastructure and human resources , as well as the use of existing or foreseen low-cost solutions ( e.g . Internet , low earth orbit satellites ) , should be enhanced .  
Also welcomes the continuing efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development , in collaboration with donor countries and institutions , in particular the United Nations Development Programme , the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions , to organize specific consultative groups , as appropriate , when requested by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned , to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional levels and draw up action programmes ;  
Social , religious and cultural networks can help to represent the specific economic interests of all the different groups in the community , particularly excluded groups ; to ensure that policies reflect the needs and interest of communities ; to ensure that policies do not lead to disintegration of communities ; to collect relevant data and information on the impact of economic policies ; to carry out participatory monitoring of policies ; and to ensure local representation in government structures .  
The final report of the Special Rapporteur ( E / CN . 4 / Sub . 2 / 1993 / 8 ) contains abundant material on which to base a definition of gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and crimes under international law for the purposes of application of the set of basic principles and guidelines or , where appropriate , the specific provisions mentioned .  
In the view of the League of Arab States , far from being limited to a specific part of the world , the dangerous consequences of terrorism will spread throughout the entire world unless there is international coordination and cooperation to combat this phenomenon , which unquestionably constitutes a flagrant violation of human rights .  
Considering that the cost-effectiveness of space technology applications had been demonstrated in several application domains for improving infrastructures , the participants observed that specific and focused cooperative efforts should be made by international organizations and by national entities to promote the use of appropriate technologies .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
Effective follow-up requires ( a ) that the reports be given active and serious consideration by the legislative organs of the participating organizations , with the benefit of specific and timely comments on them by the secretariats , and ( b ) that there is expeditious implementation of the approved recommendations contained in them , with full reporting on the implementation measures taken and analysis of the resulting impact .  
Once a report is considered by the legislative organs and decisions taken on the report as a whole and on specific recommendations , the executive heads of the concerned organizations will ensure expeditious implementation of approved / accepted recommendations ( see para . 19 below ) and full reporting on measures taken to the appropriate legislative organs .  
Invites Governments to consider , where appropriate , including in their delegations to future sessions of the Commission on Human Settlements , in accordance with the specific conditions of each country , representatives of local authorities and the relevant actors of civil society , particularly the private sector , non-governmental organizations and research organizations in the field of adequate shelter for all and sustainable human settlements development ;  
In specific terms our countries , despite various structural reforms , have been unable to attract in sufficient quantities the necessary capital inflows for investment , and are confronted at the same time with domestic supply-side constraints which limit our export potential , an unsustainable debt which swallows a great part of our national income , and declining levels of official development assistance , among others .  
Here , and with specific reference to reform of the Security Council , Benin strongly recommends that the following principles should be taken into account : an increase in the membership of the Security Council truly reflecting the political and economic configuration of today 's world ; equitable geographical representation of the five regional groups , with the African group entitled to four seats , two permanent and two non-permanent ; and protection of democratic and transparent functioning , ultimately involving the elimination of the right of veto .  
The report reviews the main strategic functions of the Organization and provides for each of them specific proposals charting the way and making Member States real partners in achieving an Organization better prepared to deal with humanitarian and political crises ; based on greater efficiency ; qualified to play a more vital role in the areas specified by the Charter ; and made imperative by the changing security , economic , social and political circumstances of this world .  
Similarly , it is recognized that implementation of the Summit 's Declaration and Programme of Action will require the mobilization of financial resources at the national and international levels and that the specific cases of Africa and the least developed countries will need additional resources and more effective development cooperation and assistance .  
Bearing in mind in particular the specific requests addressed to it by the General Assembly in resolution 51 / 146 , the Special Committee reviewed the implementation of the Declaration relating to the remaining Territories and formulated a series of recommendations with a view to enhancing the pace of decolonization and to promoting the political , economic , social and educational advancement of the peoples in those Territories .  
While adhering to the principles inherent in the Declaration , the Special Committee has in recent years considered the question of decolonization in a more realistic and pragmatic manner , taking into account the prevailing international situation , as well as recognizing the specific conditions in the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories .  
It is precisely because of our recognition of the specific and peculiar problems faced by the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories most of which are small island Territories that suffer from impediments created by the interplay of such factors as economic and geographic size , isolation , vulnerability to natural disasters and lack of technological and financial resources , including problems of accessibility to international credit markets that the international community should give specific priority and attention to the process of decolonization affecting the peoples of those Territories . 
Having regard to the major disarmament and non-proliferation conferences already scheduled for the remaining years of the decade and to the need to concentrate scarce resources on specific and focused disarmament events and on goals attainable in the short term , consensus on the timing of another special session on disarmament and broad agreement on its objectives are vital to the prospects of success .  
The urgent appeal addressed to States in operative paragraph 1 must be clearly focused on the specific objective of eliminating the irresponsible and indiscriminate use of anti-personnel landmines , which , in the final analysis , is the real cause of the problems regarding such weapons .  
Such an approach could be general or specific ; global or regional ; unilateral , bilateral or multilateral ; separate or interconnected ; step-by-step or all-encompassing , depending on the circumstances .  
The most efficient and effective roles of State and market , and of civil society , depend on economic , social , historical , environmental and cultural factors that are specific to each country .  
The Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action3 reaffirmed basic principles governing international human rights activities , set out specific goals on a wide number of areas and identified various methods to achieve them .  
While several Governments , intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in their replies emphasized the importance of developing a comprehensive approach to the problems of mass exoduses , as well as the need to pay special attention to the continuum of emergency to development assistance , others provided information on more specific programmes or on current developments in their respective countries .  
They emphasized the need for innovative approaches to address the complex and specific migratory flows that were taking place in the CIS States and highlighted the specific international standards that had been developed under the Programme of Action to address modern forms of involuntary and enforced migration , including forcibly displaced persons .  
The programme of the workshop covered four main topics : conceptual issues of poverty in old age ; women as one of the groups at risk , and the process known as the feminization of poverty ; specific issues of poverty among other groups at risk ; disabled and single persons ; and ways to create an enabling environment for the improved well-being of older people .  
Fortunately the 1995 Conference of NPT States parties has helped to identify the way forward by adopting the Principles and objectives for non _ proliferation and disarmament , in which the section on Nuclear disarmament sets out the importance to the international community of three specific objectives : the completion of negotiations for a comprehensive test _ ban treaty no later than 1996 ; the immediate commencement and early conclusion of negotiations on a fissile material cut _ off treaty ; and systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally .  
The United Nations Statistics Division has been very active in the development of satellite accounts , and proposed a system for integrated environment and economic accounting ( SEEA ) , which was published in 1993.6 Several industrialized and developing countries are presently experimenting with the implementation of satellite accounts through the general application of the SEEA framework to a specific national context ( see box 6 ) . 
As agricultural commodities continued to play a vital role in the economies of many developing countries , there was a continuing need to increase market transparency , to improve the transmission of price signals , to seek consensus among exporters and importers on policies , to pursue commodity development activities , to address environmental concerns in specific commodities and to seek WTO compatible means to handle commodity price instability .  
It also runs specific projects related to : the use of infrared imagery for public agencies , academic and other research institutions ; thermal loss in urban areas ; and the use of NOAA satellite images for the operational definition of cloud systems .  
That framework covered the creation of an enabling global environment for employment growth , policies to enhance the adaptability of the labour market and the efficient use of human resources applicable to countries at all levels of development , as well as policies specific to developing , transition , and industrialized countries .  
Second , specific structures in the economy and labour market , such as persistent occupational segregation and concentration , discrimination in pay , limited representation of women in economic decision-making and collective bargaining structures , and other implicit or explicit policies exclude women from certain economic activities and reinforce their subordination in labour markets .  
What developing country Governments need to bear in mind is that in order to improve the productivity of investment in developing countries , it is of particular importance to improve the functioning of the capital market through institutional innovation , better regulation of the banking sector , supporting credit programmes targeted at specific groups , and increasing the supply of venture capital .  
Moreover , family allowances are not common in developing countries , unemployment insurance rarely exists , and social security contributions are generally lower than in OECD countries . 7 Therefore , while some parts of the labour market regulations in developing countries are no longer compatible with today 's economic situation , whether or not there is a need for reform has to be ascertained from a specific examination of the empirical evidence . 
The Kathmandu workshop proved to be a crucial turning point when , for the first time in the series of meetings , it focused on regional arrangements , explored available options , identified specific steps as building-blocks , and concluded with a clear consensus in the form of agreed workshop conclusions .  
The proposed draft declaration deals not with some sort of single concrete mechanism for preventing and settling conflicts , but rather with the total number of such mechanisms , of course , while maintaining the specific characteristics of each of them , and with the formulation of the fundamental basic principles and criteria for their establishment and functioning , while retaining the main responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security .  
The people of Cuba as a whole are called upon to continue the profound and systematic examination of the annexationist and colonialist plans of the Government of the United States of America included in the Helms-Burton Act as a means of ensuring that in every territory , community , workplace , educational institution and military unit there is full knowledge of the specific consequences that the execution of these plans would entail for each and every citizen , and to guarantee everyone 's active and conscientious participation in the measures needed to defeat them .  
In previous reports the information and data available to the Special Rapporteur were grouped in chapters on specific categories of violations of human rights such as summary executions , arbitrary arrests , torture , violations of the rights of the child and the rights of women , freedom of expression and movement , etc . with additional paragraphs , whenever necessary , on special questions , such as incidents which prevented humanitarian activities or the situation in the Nuba Mountains .

Invites the executive heads of the organizations of the United Nations common system to develop and submit proposals to their relevant intergovernmental bodies , as a matter of priority , on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year , and to coordinate , to the extent possible , these proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General ;  
Requests the International Civil Service Commission to take the lead in analysing new approaches in the human resources management field so as to develop standards , methods and arrangements that will respond to the specific needs , especially regarding future staffing , of the organizations of the United Nations common system , including consideration of flexible contractual arrangements , performance-based pay and the introduction of special occupational pay rates , and to report to the General Assembly thereon at its fifty-third session . 
Spain reported on initiatives to combat marine pollution , including the control and monitoring of maritime transport of pollutant products that may have an impact on the environment ; the prevention of pollution from ships ; the monitoring and control of industrial waste or waste from ships ; and active participation in the implementation of specific maritime safety plans in each port , taking into account current provisions including those of the National Regulation for the Admission , Handling and Storage of Hazardous Goods in Ports .  
The internal oversight units , in particular the audit units , should be authorized to submit , through their respective executive heads , periodic comprehensive reports and ad hoc reports on specific issues to their governing bodies .  
It is recommended that the reporting procedures of funds and programmes follow similar lines as those established for the Office of Internal Oversight Services in paragraph 5 ( e ) of resolution 48 / 218 B .

However , it is something that the Commission on Human Rights must not overlook and it has to be solved on the basis of more in _ depth knowledge of the facts , specific references and a systematic analysis concluding with suggestions and proposals for the adoption of political , legal and operational standards relating to mercenary activities and to companies which sell security internationally . 
Germany reported that illicit trafficking in motor vehicles was an area covered by the act to suppress illegal drug trafficking and other manifestations of organized crime ( OrgKG ) of 15 July 1992 , which contained specific legal provisions imposing severe penalties . 
Many Governments indicated an urgent need to provide specific training for law enforcement officials on relevant issues , with a view to increasing the effectiveness of border controls , upgrading skills in identifying motor vehicles with false documents or altered security features and improving the reliability of document controls prior to the registration of a motor vehicle .  
Other important factors determining possible programmes of technical cooperation that HC / CHR provides to Member States at their request are : specific recommendations made by the United Nations human rights treaty monitoring bodies ; recommendations by the Commission on Human Rights and its mechanisms , including the representatives of the Secretary-General , the special rapporteurs on thematic or country situations and the various working groups ; the recommendations adopted by the Board of Trustees of the Voluntary Fund for Technical Cooperation ; and the views expressed by national human rights institutions and national and international NGOs .  
Questions to be considered in this context included , for example , whether a multilateral agreement on investment was needed , what the advantages of such an agreement were as compared with existing arrangements , whether such an agreement was critical for increasing FDI flows to developing countries and especially to countries in Africa , whether such an agreement would involve special treatment for LDCs , and whether there would be special provisions to take care of specific priorities of developing countries .  
The present section identifies a number of specific areas that are of widespread concern since failure to reverse current trends in those areas , notably in resource degradation , will have potentially disastrous effects on social and economic development , particularly in developing countries .

Unfortunately , there is no reliable comprehensive data on the economic aspects of natural disasters ; as a result policy makers can not base their decisions on documented facts , and cost-benefit analyses of specific natural disaster prevention or reduction measures are often questionable .  
Many of those interviewed by the Central Evaluation Unit stated that background papers and proposals for policy decisions were usually distributed too late , and as a result agency representatives often did not come to the meetings prepared to act on proposals ; many meetings had been convened with no concrete objectives set ; and work initiated by the Working Group on specific issues had been pursued in an on-and-off fashion , only reaching conclusion three to four years after initiation .  
In the inter-agency follow-up to Economic and Social Council resolution 1995 / 56 of 28 July 1995 , agencies agreed that a lead agency might be designated to carry out the functions of operational coordination for a specific target group , geographical area or technical sector ; and that the lead agency would be accountable to the resident / humanitarian coordinator .

Those programmes would be undertaken through an integrated approach which combined policy advice , technical cooperation , specific research and the exchange of experience and examples of best practice , by establishing and operating networks and partnerships at the international , regional , national and local levels . 
Some of the specific ongoing research projects include : predictive study on trends in the life-supporting environment in China over the next 20 to 50 years ; dynamic processes and prediction of trends in environmental changes in arid and semi-arid regions of China ; research on global environmental change in Antarctica ; the field experiment in the Heihe river basin on the interaction between the atmosphere and the land surface ; experiments on ocean circulation in the tropical western Pacific ; and studies on the formation , evolution and environmental changes of the ecosystem in the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau .  
In the case of UNDP , non-core resources are constituted by funds contributed by governmental or private sources and intended for specific purposes , i.e . , identified projects or programmes , or assistance within geographic or thematic areas .  
In the present stage of global developments , there is a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution to each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations ;

It was built on an innovative model that combined central coordination functions , vested in ACC and the newly established Inter-Agency Committee on Sustainable Development , and decentralized allocation of specific responsibilities to relevant organizations of the United Nations system , based on their comparative strengths , to act as task managers for various programme components of Agenda 21 .  
As planned , the Task Force produced a synthesis report for use by the resident coordinator system , summarizing lessons of experience at the country level and across countries with a view to suggesting ways of improving inter-agency collaboration in the future and providing a clear understanding of the different ingredients that work for the promotion of employment and sustainable livelihoods in specific situations and of the necessary indicators for monitoring progress in these areas .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
United Nations technical cooperation assistance to developing countries takes into account their specific needs caused by small size and low level of economic and social development .  
The Committee recommended the establishment of specific machinery located at the highest policy level , with adequate financial and human resources , that would coordinate and guide action in favour of women , would be able to prevent the persistence of attitudes , prejudices and stereotypes that discriminate against women and would narrow the gap between de jure and de facto equality .  
On the subject of refugee status being granted to women fleeing female genital mutilation as mentioned by the Special Rapporteur in her final report , note should be taken with satisfaction of the initiative taken by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in September 1996 when it assembled the representatives of 16 Western countries in Geneva to draw the attention of the authorities responsible for awarding refugee status to the problems specific to women and which differ from the generally recognized forms of political persecution .

The emphasis given by the Commission on Sustainable Development at its fourth session to the importance of effective conservation and management of fish stocks , and in particular to eliminating overfishing , in order to identify specific steps at national or regional levels to prevent or eliminate excess fishing capacity , will need to be carried forward in all appropriate international forums including , in particular , the Committee on Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) ;  
Countries need to systematically increase the use of renewable energy sources according to their specific social , economic , natural , geographical and climatic conditions and cleaner fuel technologies , including fossil fuel technologies , and to improve efficiency in energy production , distribution and use and in other industrial production processes that are intensive users of energy ;  
When genetic variations are lost , therefore , the result is not only that specific and potential properties and adaptations are lost but also that the number of species is diminished , ecosystems are impaired and the ability to sustain human life is damaged .

They also agreed that regular meetings between their senior military and security officials , as well as joint military exercises and patrols and participation in subregional or regional peace operations , would help not only to tackle specific concerns such as controlling the illicit trade in arms and drugs and helping to resolve specific conflicts , but also to enhance overall transparency and confidence among Central African States . 
While saluting the efforts of the document 's authors , his delegation considered that it might be possible to make a less rigorous procedure for access to the geostationary orbit available solely to systems intended exclusively to serve the territory of a specific developing country and not to provide an international link , but not to the so-called " paper " satellite systems . 
Such adverse effects may occur not only whenever specific postal material is the subject of sanctions , but also when air traffic to a sanctioned State is interrupted or suspended .  
Noting with concern the absence in the countries concerned of specific legislation to govern offences committed by minor children , the absence of preventive and educational measures for their reintegration into society which would enable minor detainees to become rehabilitated and no longer marginalized , as well as the very limited number of children 's magistrates capable of understanding the problems of delinquent children and seeing that they are cared for ,  
The States participating in the Regional Ministerial Workshop decided that the early formulation of national positions was essential to ensure that their specific concerns would be appropriately reflected in the text of an international convention against organized transnational crime .  
Where developing countries have been watchful of the cost of incentives and applied them within an outward-oriented approach , microeconomic measures addressing specific supply constraints have helped build supply capabilities which the private sector could not have accomplished as rapidly by itself . \ x { ffff } seq level0 \ * arabic \ x { ffff } 24 \ x { ffff } .

In the declaration it adopted at the Summit meeting in September of last year , the Council reaffirmed its determination to give equal priority to the maintenance of international peace and security in every region of the world , while paying special attention to the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa , in view of the special needs of the continent and the specific characteristics of the conflicts raging on its territories .  
The Fourth World Conference on Women reaffirmed that the human rights of women and of the girl child are an inalienable , integral and indivisible part of universal human rights and established a number of specific strategic objectives to ensure that women enjoy their full human rights .  
The representative of New Zealand , noting the absence of a legal framework specific to internally displaced persons , stated that such persons were of course covered by international human rights law and that there was no excuse for States not to follow such international human rights principles and the legal guidance based on them as contained in the Guiding Principles ( S / PV . 4130 ) .  
Though important steps were taken in accordance with the Programme for Reform to close this gap - the designation of the Emergency Relief Coordinator as the focal point for coordinating the international response to the assistance and protection needs of internally displaced persons , the designation of focal points on internally displaced persons in many of the relevant agencies and NGOs , and more regular discussion of issues of internal displacement in the IASC - the response to specific situations of internal displacement has remained ad hoc and still largely focused on assistance .  
It was therefore necessary to support country programmes and integrated regional programmes , which enabled beneficiaries to obtain a more specific range of technical cooperation services , while themselves determining the fundamental direction of their economic development .  Implementation of those programmes could of course run into difficulties through a lack of resources , problems of evaluating results and demand that exceeded existing financial possibilities .  
In that sense , Peru endorsed the United Nations Programme on Space Applications but believed that the measures covered by the Programme could be carried out only through effective international cooperation based on access to technology , the elaboration of specific projects for space activities and the transmission of processed information that would have a practical and direct effect on the sustainable development of States . 
Its aim is to provide some very specific material regarding its record on concerns of the highest priority for Colombian society as a whole , and to set forth its position on those points where it differs from the Offices report , with a view to making constructive and substantial progress in the common struggle for the realization of fundamental rights and the application of international humanitarian law in Colombia .  
Its aim is to provide some very specific material regarding its record on concerns of the highest priority for Colombian society as a whole , and to set forth its position on those points where it differs from the Offices report , with a view to making constructive and substantial progress in the common struggle for the realization of fundamental rights and the application of international humanitarian law in Colombia .  
The work of the Conference was organized around three technical committees , established to deal with a range of specific issues pertinent to cartography , surveying , land management , GIS technology and spatial data infrastructure in support of sustainable development , as defined by an agenda item of the Conference .  
It had before it the draft provisional agenda prepared by the extended bureau of the Commission , reflecting the decision of the Economic and Social Council , contained in its resolution 1999 / 30 of 28 July 1999 , that the agenda of the Commission should be structured in two distinct segments , and that the Commission should convene , whenever appropriate , ministerial-level segments of its sessions to focus on specific themes related to the follow-up to the twentieth special session of the General Assembly .  
Efforts to establish an international enabling environment should be conducted in a spirit of partnership between developed and developing countries based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and taking into account the specific conditions of individual countries , in accordance with the Rio Declaration and Agenda 21 .  
Likewise , it was considered prudent to retain the primacy of the sectoral conventions since they included specific and more elaborate provisions on the acts in question , for example in the field of civil aviation and maritime safety , which were not included in the comprehensive convention .  
The Subcommittee agreed that the draft Unidroit convention on international interests in mobile equipment and the preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property represented an important initiative that was of considerable interest to member States .  
Those delegations were of the view that it would be inappropriate for the Subcommittee to give detailed consideration to matters falling within the field of private law and consequently attention should be focused exclusively on the compatibility with existing international space law of the draft Unidroit convention and preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property .  
Firstly , those delegations were of the view that the fact that the preliminary draft protocol had been based largely on the draft protocol on matters specific to aircraft equipment failed to take into account to a sufficient extent the unique nature and utilization of space objects and equipment and their fundamental differences on technical , operational and legal levels from aircraft equipment .  
Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated , on an equal footing and a consistent way , with the realization of the broader social development goals , taking into account the specific characteristics , conditions and needs of the debtor countries ;  
The role of the private sector in the implementation of the UNFF plan of action could be twofold : first , as an important implementing agent of specific IPF / IFF proposals for action that are specifically addressed to the private sector ; and second , as a crucial financing source to complement national and international public funds .  
Other relevant and interested international and regional organizations , institutions and instruments that are not members of CPF , including non-governmental organizations , private sector entities and other major groups , will be invited to contribute to specific activities of CPF , for example , certain projects , programmes , expert meetings and other activities , where their competencies would enrich the thematic work of CPF in the implementation of IPF / IFF proposals for action .  
Policy level : UNFF could call upon Governments to provide guidance to the governing bodies of the CPF members , as well as send specific calls to governing bodies , inter alia , to encourage CPF to increase joint programming ; and to continue to seek political support , as well as to have regular contacts with non-governmental organizations , private sector entities and other major groups ; Operational level : UNFF could call upon CPF to support its work at three operational levels by :  
Under the direct supervision of the Senior Adviser to the Executive Director , the incumbent collects and analyses data pertinent to the management of the organization ; organizes and summarizes background information and prepares summary reports on specific issues analysed , and develops draft recommendations thereon ; holds consultative meetings with senior staff in UNEP and the United Nations Office at Nairobi to seek information required and to discuss work practices ; and contributes to developing and strategizing the presentation of management data ;  
During the biennium 2002-2003 , in the personnel and general administration areas the High-level Committee on Management will place emphasis on human resources management and reform of the common system by continuing specific studies covering the role and function of the international civil service and its underpinnings , the development of a senior management cadre , the further development of system-wide standards on contractual patterns and employment conditions and the implications of other management reforms , such as downsizing and outsourcing , for the participating organizations .  
The Commission may therefore wish to request the Secretariat to undertake further study in close cooperation with international organizations specializing in relevant areas of law , such as Unidroit , the Hague Conference on Private International Law and the World Intellectual Property Organization , with a view to ascertaining whether and to what extent a uniform regime addressing those more specific types of assets would be desirable and feasible and which organizations should be involved in that work .  
Stresses the need for the economic programmes arising from foreign debt to be country-driven and for their macroeconomic and financial policy issues to be integrated , on an equal footing and a consistent way , with the realization of the broader social development goals , taking into account the specific characteristics , conditions and needs of the debtor countries ;  
The view was expressed that the increasing involvement of private industry in space activities required some clarification of specific terms within the legal instruments governing outer space activities in order to strengthen their application .  
Some delegations expressed the view that the draft Unidroit convention on international interests in mobile equipment and the preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property represented an important initiative that was of considerable interest to member States .  
Those delegations were of the view that it would be inappropriate for the Subcommittee to give detailed consideration to matters falling within the field of private law and consequently attention should be focused exclusively on the compatibility with existing international space law of the draft Unidroit convention and preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property .  
Firstly , those delegations were of the view that the fact that the preliminary draft protocol had been based largely on the draft protocol on matters specific to aircraft equipment failed to take into account to a sufficient extent the unique nature and utilization of space objects and equipment and their fundamental differences on technical , operational and legal levels from aircraft equipment .  
Based on common international understandings that respect diversity and specific country circumstances , these national efforts should be supported by an enabling international environment , including good international financial and trade governance and adequate external resources mobilization .  
What kind of awareness-raising and specific policy coordination effort could major industrialized countries undertake to fulfil their special responsibility in ensuring that their macroeconomic policies , including exchange rate policies , take into account their effects in creating an international economic environment favourable to equitable growth and development , international financial stability and enhanced financial flows for development ? 
Thus , an analysis by the Working Group of legal issues related to the creation of electronic substitutes for paper-based transport documents would be a meaningful contribution to that other project , as it might result in the development of specific electronic commerce-focused provisions that might , at an appropriate time , become an integral part of that new international regime expected to be developed by the Commission .  
Urge the United Nations , other appropriate international and regional organizations and States to redress the marginalization of Africas contribution to world history and civilization by developing and implementing a specific and comprehensive programme of research , education and mass communication to widely disseminate the truth about Africas seminal and valuable contribution to humanity ;  
Urge those States in which the political and legal systems do not reflect their multiracial , multi-ethnic , multilingual and multicultural realities to review those systems , in consultation with representatives of the affected groups , with a view to improving democratic institutions so that they are more fully participatory and avoid marginalization , exclusion and discrimination of specific sectors of society , including indigenous peoples , people of African descent , migrants and other victims of racism ;  
As a global approach covering , in a coherent manner , the specific requirements of national , regional and international markets regarding quality standards , does not exist , companies are inclined to adopt the ISO 9000 and ISO 14000 series of standards .  
The aggregate income figure of $ 2.2-billion ( including funds from other sources ) masks the serious financial crisis that UNDP is facing in its regular resource base since regular and other resources are not interchangeable ; other resources represent earmarked contributions to specific themes , programmes and activities , and tend to be geographically concentrated , and are also not adhered to the programme priorities identified by the UNDP Executive Board .  
While the law can and should incorporate national policy , specific and positive references to cooperatives and the international cooperative movement , unique contributions to national life and similar references should not be incorporated as part of the guidelines ;  
The objective of the present guidelines is to provide advice to Governments and set out broad principles on which national cooperative policy might best be based , recognizing that more specific and detailed national policies fall within the responsibility of each Government .  
To implement and follow up the commitments undertaken pursuant to paragraph 17 of the Vienna Declaration and to develop , adopt and implement effective domestic legislation , regulations and administrative measures to prevent , detect and combat , in cooperation with other States , domestic and transnational money-laundering , in accordance with the relevant international instruments , in particular the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime , and using as a guideline the relevant initiatives of regional , interregional and multilateral organizations against money-laundering , the specific measures below are recommended .  
They should be able to complete their studies and to undertake specific courses of concerted study having moral and social value enabling them to improve their creative abilities and acquire the skills required for everyday life .  
Governments , with the assistance of relevant United Nations entities , needed to adopt a long-term , timely , coherent and integrated AIDS prevention policy , with public information , life skills-based education programmes specifically tailored to the needs of women and girls , adapted to their social cultural context and sensitivities and the specific needs in their life cycle .  
To contribute to the search for a common denominator based on the peace agreements that would win the support of broad sectors of the population , MINUGUA , at the request of the parties , held an extensive round of consultations through which it discovered that there was some readiness on the part of sectors of society to work together on specific issues .  
Further , except for certain ultra hazardous activities which are mostly the subject of special regulation , e.g . , in the nuclear field or in the context of activities in outer space , the risk that flows from an activity is primarily a function of the particular application , the specific context and the manner of operation .  
The Joint Inspection Unit will , on the basis of selected economic and social programmes of the United Nations , examine whether such expectations can be met in view of the very different nature of the various programmes and make specific recommendations accordingly .  18 .  The Unit decided to include this subject in its work programme for 2001 pursuant to article 12 of its statute which states the following :  
The President also informed members that , subject to the rules of procedure of the General Assembly , entities of the United Nations system , including programmes , funds , specialized agencies and regional commissions , with specific expertise in the subject matter of the special session , might make statements in the debate in plenary , provided that they were represented at the highest level .  
Until these fundamental issues are addressed , local police will not be able to substitute for a continued robust international security presence mandated , staffed and equipped to maintain overall security and provide specific protection to international personnel and property .  
Such confidence and security-building measures can be pursued at various levels , bilateral , subregional , regional and multilateral even unilateral measures are conceivable and can be applied flexibly to conform to the political and security characteristics and requirements of specific situations .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Under the CDI Americas initiative , the Inter-American Development Bank is committed to establishing partnerships with international , national and local public and private organizations according to the specific needs of the countries .  
A salient feature of that programme was organizing periodic seminars / symposia to focus attention on specific issues falling within the framework of disarmament and development in the context of current international relations , as well as providing a forum where relevant United Nations bodies , non-governmental organizations and other international agencies could share their experience in areas of common or overlapping concerns .  
Recommends that the Commission on Human Rights prepare complementary international standards to strengthen and update international legislation against racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , including by drawing up an international code of ethics for communications media , especially the Internet , that includes specific measures to combat the unlawful dissemination of information that is racist , discriminatory , xenophobic or relating to intolerance ;  
Allow me to briefly reiterate some of these proposals : enhanced coordination ; a regular flow of information ; the exchange of liaison officers ; joint training of staff in the field of early warning and prevention ; joint expert meetings on specific areas of early warning and prevention ; the development of common indicators for early warning ; and the establishment of a database on the conflict prevention capabilities of both the United Nations and the regional organizations . 
UNIDO should systematize successful experiences and models of sustainable industrial development , taking account of the specific conditions in each country , so that strategic alliances with other international or regional bodies could be established .  
The Committee concluded that Convention No . 89 , as revised by the 1990 Protocol , retains its relevance for some countries as a means of protecting those women who need protection from the harmful effects and risks of night work in certain circumstances , while acknowledging the need for flexible and consensual solutions to specific problems and for consistency with modern thinking and principles on maternity protection .  
Pursuant to the Accord , the Kanaks and the other communities assumed responsibility for their shared destiny on the basis of the rehabilitation of the colonized indigenous Kanak people ; the foundations for wanting to live with one another ( citizenship , identity signs specific to New Caledonia ) ; and a gradual and irreversible power to transfer responsibilities towards full sovereignty .  
In the current stage of global development , there is still a need for identifying and implementing innovative practical and pragmatic approaches in the search for a specific solution for each of the remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the populations concerned and in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations , General Assembly resolutions 1514 ( XV ) and 1541 ( XV ) and other relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations .  
Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the sentiments of the peoples of the Territories require flexible , practical and innovative approaches to the options of self-determination , without any prejudice to territorial size , geographical location , size of population or natural resources ,  
Welcomes the current participation in the capacity of observers of those Non-Self-Governing Territories that are associate members of the regional commissions in United Nations world conferences in the economic and social sphere , subject to the rules of procedure of the General Assembly and in accordance with relevant United Nations resolutions and decisions , including resolutions and decisions of the Assembly and the Special Committee on specific Territories , and in the special sessions of the Assembly ;  
To develop and implement , where possible , effective disarmament , demobilization and reintegration programmes , including the effective collection , control , storage and destruction of small arms and light weapons , particularly in post-conflict situations , unless another form of disposition or use has been duly authorized , and such weapons have been marked and the alternate form of disposition or use has been recorded , and to include , where applicable , specific provisions for these programmes in peace agreements .  
A unilateral statement formulated by a State or an international organization when signing , ratifying , formally confirming , accepting , approving or acceding to a treaty , or by a State when making a notification of succession to a treaty , whereby the State or international organization subjects its consent to be bound by the treaty to a specific interpretation of the treaty or of certain provisions thereof , shall constitute a conditional interpretative declaration .  
Requests Annex II Parties to provide detailed information , in their national communications and / or any other relevant reports , on their existing and planned support programmes to meet the specific needs and concerns of developing country Parties arising from the impact of the implementation of response measures ;  
Governments , donors , non-governmental organizations and the private sector should develop specific assistance programmes and advisory services for the development of the economic skills of rural women in banking , modern trading and financial procedures , matching the requirements of the market economy .  
Following the establishment of the Republic of Yemen in 1990 , which ushered in an era of democratization and active civil institutions , the number of non-governmental organizations and institutions engaged in activities relating to the protection and promotion of human rights in general or focusing on a particular field , such as political , civil , economic or cultural rights or protection of the rights of a specific section of society , such as women , children or the disabled , increased considerably and currently amounts to about 2,000 .  
I encourage the Security Council to conduct more frequent fact-finding missions to conflict areas with a view to identifying the specific requirements for humanitarian assistance , in particular obtaining safe and meaningful access to vulnerable populations .  In view of the prevalence of civil wars among todays conflicts , a structured dialogue with armed groups is indispensable for reaching and protecting vulnerable populations in times of war ( see paras . 30-32 and 48-50 ) .  
Here a broad trend was evident : those instruments with a specific target ( such as environmental protection ) generally had an in-built mechanism of implementation , including financial provisions ( such as the Montreal Protocol ) , while those instruments dealing with transfer of technology as a broad objective often relied on national measures in developed country addressees for their successful implementation ( such as the TRIPS Agreement ( article 66.2 ) ) .  
Anti-trust-law which was aimed at preserving workable markets ( i.e . markets that were subject to workable competition obliging enterprises to meet the prices of rivals ) could aid in this process through the creation of the right conditions for the transferor and the recipient that established a balance between the interests of all parties ( in subcontracting , foreign direct investment , research and development cooperation and licensing ) , although this balance must be adjusted to the specific circumstances prevailing in individual cases .  
He also stressed that the technology transfer provisions analysed in the secretariat = s issues note related to specific circumstances , as indicated in the note , where a common good was at stake ( such as the global ozone layer in the Montreal Protocol and the deep sea-bed in UNCLOS ) and it was only to this extent that there was a politically and legally persuasive case for asking developed country addressees to give additional incentives for transfer of technology .  
While it may be of excellent quality for other language professions for which there is a strong demand , that training appears to be in some respects ill-suited to the special and stringent requirements of the United Nations and of other international organizations for multilingual staff proficient in their specific official languages .  
The fact that , in addition to the intergovernmental track focusing on the formulation of the new Programme of Action , it included a country-level track to prepare national-level programmes of action for individual least developed countries , an early deliverables thematic track leading to specific actions and initiatives for immediate implementation , and a civil society track , including the NGO forum , facilitated the launching of several important and concrete initiatives in the context of what was called the deliverables .  
The Senior Gender Adviser will be supported by a Gender Programme Support Officer ( P-3 ) , who will undertake research and collection of data on specific topics related to peacekeeping and gender ; maintain working level contacts with entities of the United Nations system on gender issues ; establish and maintain a network of external experts on gender , peace and security to provide technical advice for the Department as needed ; collect and disseminate good practices and lessons learned on gender matters in peacekeeping .  
Moreover , a discussion was held on the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and the possible content of such an instrument ( e.g . development concerns to link in a clear manner energy services and development including the achievement of public services goals and promotion of competition and of foreign investment in the energy sector consistent with development goals ) .  
In particular , Parties have raised specific concerns regarding : ( i ) the competence of participants in the CST , ( ii ) the political nature of discussions within the CST , rather than a focus on scientific and technological issues , ( iii ) the lack of continuity of representatives to the CST , and ( iv ) inadequate time within the agenda of the CST to allow for in-depth analysis and debate of the issues .  
The most important substantive issue was likely to be institutional , namely the creation of an integrated framework acting under the auspices of the United Nations to ensure coherence in the treatment of international economic questions , avoiding in this process any negative impact on the autonomy and individual mandates of specific organizations such as the Bretton Woods institutions or the different members of the United Nations family .  
In response , the Secretary-General of UNCTAD expressed some scepticism about the prospects for achieving concrete results at the conference on specific aspects of issues such as trade , ODA , and FDI , since these were all being discussed in other multilateral fora or were covered under actions at regional , bilateral and national levels ; any decision would have to be coordinated with those discussions .  
The majority of those in academic circles who dealt with the issue of terrorism shared the opinion that terrorism meant the following : the use of or threat to use violence for political purposes ; a method of fighting or reaching specific goals based on intimidation of a society and government by causing human casualties and loss of property , characterized by ruthlessness and violation of moral and legal norms .  
While bilateral cooperation , especially in regard to technical cooperation , remains a prevalent form of South-South cooperation , conscious efforts are being made by developing countries to pool their resources and capacities institutional , intellectual , technical and financial to address issues of common concern or specific development problems that affect a large number of people and countries .  
The provision of $ 1,649,200 would provide for specialized contractual security training and the production of publications considered essential for the success of functioning of the new security management system , including : ( a ) requirements of $ 1,270,000 for security , emergency , stress management and other specialized training to be organized through specific seminars and courses , including the preparation of related training material , and ( b ) requirements of $ 379,200 for production of the Security Handbook in all official languages and the periodic reprinting of various updated security materials .  
Moreover , the international community must take action to bolster existing mechanisms and instruments and to set out a specific timetable for the successive stages of general disarmament and for the elimination of weapons of mass destruction nuclear , chemical and biological in particular .  
Despite repeated calls for a change in the current international economic , trade and financial system , which did not meet the needs of the developing countries , especially those of the most vulnerable , no specific conclusions had yet been reached .  
The Committee is aware of the importance of effective public information programmes in peacekeeping operations and the need to carefully identify and implement those programmes on the basis of objectives tailored to the specific needs of the missions concerned , including adequate resources for those programmes ( see A / 55 / 839 , para .  44 ) .  
The working groups are responsible for : ( a ) assessment of critical existing central , shared or common services with a view to identifying areas of possible improvement in quality and cost-effectiveness ; ( b ) review of the potential for expansion of central , shared or common services ; and ( c ) recommendation of the specific actions to be taken , together with the timetable , estimate of resources required and definition of accountability for their implementation , including the identification of a lead agency or organization , where appropriate .  
It further urged the United Nations to redress the marginalization of Africas contribution to world history and civilization by developing and implementing a specific and comprehensive programme of research , education and mass communication to disseminate widely a balanced and objective presentation of Africas seminal and valuable contribution to humanity .  
These are of fundamental importance in assuring that the customary rules of international humanitarian law governing the choice of weapons are faithfully applied to specific weapons likely to have indiscriminate effects and cause suffering beyond military necessity or which simply are abhorrent .  
Besides poverty reduction , the international community had given specific commitments to ensure that by 2015 boys and girls would have equal access to primary schooling and had also resolved to reduce maternal mortality by three quarters , to reduce child mortality by two thirds , to restrict the spread of HIV / AIDS , malaria and tuberculosis , and to improve the conditions of 100-million urban poor by 2020 .  
Recommends that , within existing budgetary resources or , where necessary , with the help of extrabudgetary or voluntary resources , the concerned specialized agencies , funds and programmes of the United Nations system provide to the bodies responsible for the advancement of women , information that would enable them to undertake a precise and in-depth analysis of the situation of older women , including developing , if necessary , specific new methods for data collection ;  
Therefore , the delegations of Ecuador , Brazil , Chile , Canada and Guatemala reaffirm the importance for the strengthening and advancement of human rights and the combat of racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance , of developing , implementing and improving specific policies and programmes to address effectively a serious form of multiple discrimination , which occurs when racism , racial discrimination , xenophobia and related intolerance intersect with discrimination based on sexual orientation .  
The World Conference should acknowledge that differences in ethnic identities have long manifested themselves in diverse ways , but should recognize that the racism of the colonial era constituted an unprecedented system of thought and action that has a specific historical origin in the transatlantic slave trade and the consequent development of the global racial chattel enslavement of Africans .  
Moreover , a discussion was held on the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and the possible content of such an instrument ( e.g . development concerns to link in a clear manner energy services and development including the achievement of public services goals and promotion of competition and of foreign investment in the energy sector consistent with development goals ) .  
Emphasize that there are principal victims of the violations of economic , social and cultural rights , in particular indigenous peoples , migrants , persons of African origin , the unemployed , uneducated children , women , older persons , persons with a disability and other persons in situations subject to more severe discrimination , and call on States to adopt specific action to meet their needs ;  
With regard to the possibility of not including in the draft Guide to Practice draft guidelines specifically relating to conditional interpretative declarations , his delegation felt that if it was confirmed that such declarations were subject , mutatis mutandis , to the same legal regime as reservations , it would be necessary to continue looking at actual practice in order to corroborate that conclusion , and to that end States and international organizations must provide more specific information as promptly as possible . 
Recognizing that , in addition to the general problems of development , small island developing States experience specific problems arising from their smallness , remoteness , geographical dispersion , vulnerability to natural disasters , fragile ecosystems , constraints on transport and communication , isolation from markets , vulnerability to exogenous economic and financial shocks , limited internal markets , lack of natural resources , limited fresh water supply , heavy dependence on imports and limited commodities , depletion of non-renewable resources and migration ,  
Highlights of the work of the Legal Subcommittee had included its discussion of a new agenda item entitled Consideration of the draft convention of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) on international interests in mobile equipment and the preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property , a timely issue because of the increased participation of private entities in space activities . 
His delegation welcomed the efforts of the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law ( UNIDROIT ) with regard to a draft convention on international interests in mobile equipment and the preliminary draft protocol thereto on matters specific to space property ; given the growth in commercial use of outer space and the increasing role played by the private sector , further work was necessary to develop legal instruments and regulations to deal with matters such as financing , mortgages and guarantees . 
Recognizing that , in addition to the general problems of development , small island developing States experience specific problems arising from their smallness , remoteness , geographical dispersion , vulnerability to natural disasters , fragile ecosystems , constraints on transport and communication , isolation from markets , vulnerability to exogenous economic and financial shocks , limited internal markets , lack of natural resources , limited fresh water supply , heavy dependence on imports and limited commodities , depletion of non-renewable resources and migration ,  
Experts mentioned the following as being among the specific difficulties faced by SMEs : demand volatility , and the consequent lack of transparency and predictability in the business environment ; large capital requirements ; weak linkages with international markets ; scarce information about commercial opportunities abroad ; and the difficulty in finding highly trained personnel .  
These included proposals for clarification of the scope of energy services and improvement of current classification , the development of a checklist which could be used as a tool to facilitate negotiations at the multilateral and regional levels , the suitability of developing an instrument specific to the energy services sector and comparable to the Reference Paper on Basic Telecommunications , and its possible content .  
Requests the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory committee for the World Summit to decide on all remaining issues related to the organization of work of the Summit , including specific details of the series of events to be held in partnership with stakeholders , the short multi-stakeholder event involving the highest level of representation from major groups and Governments and the round-table meetings to be held at the level of heads of State or Government ;  
Recognizing that , in addition to the general problems of development , small island developing States experience specific problems arising from their smallness , remoteness , geographical dispersion , vulnerability to natural disasters , fragile ecosystems , constraints on transport and communication , isolation from markets , vulnerability to exogenous economic and financial shocks , limited internal markets , lack of natural resources , limited fresh water supply , heavy dependence on imports and limited commodities , depletion of non-renewable resources and migration ,  
Recognizing that , within the context of the challenges of development , small island developing States can experience specific problems arising from smallness , remoteness , geographical dispersion , vulnerability to natural disasters , fragile ecosystems , constraints on transport and communication , isolation from markets , vulnerability to exogenous economic and financial shocks , limited internal markets , lack of natural resources , limited freshwater supply , heavy dependence on imports and limited commodities , depletion of non-renewable resources and migration ,  
Paragraph 26.9 stated that the level of resource requirements did not include any provision for the information activities associated with special meetings and conferences to be scheduled for the biennium 2002-2003 and that , should the Department of Public Information be required to carry out promotional and informational activities specific to those meetings and conferences , the necessary requirements would be sought through the presentation of statements of programme budget implications .  
Requests the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory committee for the World Summit to decide on all remaining issues related to the organization of work of the Summit , including specific details of the series of events to be held in partnership with stakeholders , the short multi-stakeholder event involving the highest level of representation from major groups and Governments and the round-table meetings to be held at the level of heads of State or Government ;  
Requests the Commission on Sustainable Development acting as the preparatory committee for the Summit to decide on all remaining issues related to the organization of work of the Summit , including specific details of the series of events to be held in partnership with stakeholders , the short multi-stakeholder event involving the highest level of representation from major groups and Governments and the round-table meetings to be held at the level of heads of State or Government ;  
Notes that country-driven programming offers additional opportunities for greater use of technical cooperation among developing countries modalities by programme countries , and reiterates its call on the United Nations system to take more concerted and coordinated measures to improve the effective incorporation of technical cooperation among developing countries into their programmes and projects and to intensify efforts , including by developing specific mechanisms to mainstream this modality into the United Nations coordination frameworks in collaboration with the Special Unit for Technical Cooperation among Developing Countries of the United Nations Development Programme , and all other relevant international institutions ;  
With regard to trade and environment , the World Trade Organization has agreed to negotiations on the relationship between existing World Trade Organization rules and specific trade obligations set out in multilateral environmental agreements ( MEAs ) , 13 procedures for regular information exchange between MEA secretariats and the relevant World Trade Organization committees , and the reduction or , as appropriate , elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods and services .  
In addition to the criteria set out above , the expert groups were required to take specific account of the indicators contained in the main existing sets of high-level indicators , unless there was an overriding technical reason for recommending an alternative .  
Tunisia also attached great importance to the transparency of the Rio + 10 process , which , after assessing progress over the past 10 years , should develop specific action for the future and establish a detailed schedule for implementation of the Rio commitments , particularly those involving human and institutional capacity-building , the transfer of ecologically rational technologies and the provision of financial resources . 
Requests the Secretary-General to present to the General Assembly at its resumed fifty-sixth session , or no later than its fifty-seventh session , through the relevant intergovernmental and expert bodies , specific proposals for the conversion of some of the temporary assistant posts requested in section 2 into established posts wherever that would measurably lead to higher efficiency and better quality of services ;  
Two subregional and five national training workshops , taking into account the specific characteristics of the municipal systems , specifically on the promotion of community involvement in the definition of priorities and initiatives to reduce urban poverty ; facilitating the formation of social capital through a participatory process , incorporating the most vulnerable groups ; and increasing productivity in municipal investment through integrated programmes and action .
